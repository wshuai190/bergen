Document [3] states that social psychology is distinguished from other subjects by its particular emphasis on what happens within the minds of individuals and their influence on behavior, and that social psychologists use methods such as experiments or correlational methods to develop solid and applicable theories. Document [4] explains that social psychology employs scientific methods and empirical study, unlike folk wisdom, which relies on anecdotal observations and subjective interpretation. Document [5] states that social psychology research methods allow psychologists to get a better look at what causes people to engage in certain behaviors in social situations, and that these methods allow researchers to test hypotheses and theories and look for relationships between different variables. Document [6] emphasizes the importance of scientific research in understanding social behavior, and that social psychologists believe that the study of social behavior should be empirical based on the collection and systematic analysis of observable data. Document [7] discusses the scientific method and how it is used to test hypotheses, and that anecdotal evidence is not a reliable form of evidence. Document [8] explains that scientists rely on systematic observation over opinion, or anecdotal evidence, and that the scientific method begins with observing the world around us and thinking of an interesting question. Document [9] states that social psychologists have always relied on carefully designed laboratory environments to run experiments where they can closely control situations and manipulate variables. Document [10] discusses the use of complex experimental designs, field experiments, naturalistic observation, survey research, nonconscious techniques, and archival research in social psychology research. Document [11] explains that surveys are a type of descriptive research that allows social psychology researchers to gather a large amount of data relatively quickly, easily, and cheaply.

Germany was required to pay the Allies $33 billion in reparations, which crippled the German economy and led to a severe economic depression in the 1920s. The treaty also forced Germany to give up territory to Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, return Alsace and Lorraine to France, and cede all of its overseas colonies in China, the Pacific, and Africa to the Allied nations. The loss of territory and industrial resources severely impacted Germany's economy, making it difficult for the country to recover from the devastating effects of World War I. The treaty's terms also led to hyperinflation, as Germany printed more money to pay off its debt, causing the value of the currency to drop dramatically.

The government's censorship extends to social media, with the government tracking people's social media posts, which can be linked to the user's family and location. The government also uses facial recognition technology to identify people in crowded places, and has installed \"robot police\" in train stations that scan people's faces and match those of wanted fugitives.
