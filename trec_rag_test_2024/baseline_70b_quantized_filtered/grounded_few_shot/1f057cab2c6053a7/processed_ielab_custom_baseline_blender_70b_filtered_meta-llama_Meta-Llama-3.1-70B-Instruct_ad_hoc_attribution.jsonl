The Crusaders brought perfume-making techniques from the Middle East to Europe in the Middle Ages, and the first cologne made with scent, water, and alcohol was created in 1709.

Dioxins and furans can be released into the air and water through the burning of plastics and heavy metals, contaminating the air, soil, and groundwater, and posing a threat to human health. Open burning of printed wiring boards can increase the concentration of dioxins in surrounding areas, causing neurological disorders and other health problems. Informal recycling practices can lead to the release of toxic chemicals and heavy metals, posing a risk to workers and local communities, and contaminating the environment. Burning of insulated wires can cause neurological disorders and acute exposure to cadmium, and long-term exposure to lead on printed circuit boards and computer and television screens can damage the central and peripheral nervous system and kidneys, especially in children.
