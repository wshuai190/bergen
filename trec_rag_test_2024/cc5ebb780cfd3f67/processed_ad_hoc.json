Baiting involves offering something that appeals to the victim's desire, such as a free download or a hidden reward.

Figurative language can draw the reader into the story quickly, build a certain mood, and evoke emotions. For example, Edgar Allan Poe's use of similes in \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" creates a dreadful and eerie mood. It adds dimension to our prose and poetry, allowing us to say things with more flair and color. The use of figurative language allows us to say more in fewer words. It makes connections based on sound, connotation, and the construction of phrases and words.",
