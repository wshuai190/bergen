Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe pulmonary involvement and develop neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and strikingly elevated levels of IL-6. There is an over-exuberant cytokine release with hyperferritinemia leading to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome spectrum. Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still''s disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock. Numerous studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of ferritin and its association with mortality and sustained inflammatory process. High levels of free iron are harmful in tissues, especially through the redox damage that can lead to fibrosis. Iron chelation represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. In addition, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-fibrotic activity. Herein, we analyse the pathogenic role of ferritin and iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose iron depletion therapy as a novel therapeutic approach in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDocument [2]: Title: Association between iron status and the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 Abstract: Background & aims: Iron is an essential trace element to almost all organism, and the delicate balance between host defend system and viral proliferation plays an important role in infective conditions. While the association of the iron metabolism with the prognosis of COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations of systemic iron metabolism parameters with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020). Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory examinations, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of iron parameter levels with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Results: We identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54-73) and the median length of hospital stay was 28 days (IQR: 17-40). After adjusting for age, sex, IL-6, and pre-existing comorbidities, all iron parameters were associated with the severity of COVID-19 with adjusted risk ratio of 0.42 [95% CI: 0.22-0.83], 4.38 [95% CI: 1.86-10.33], 0.19 [95% CI: 0.08-0.48], and 0.25 [95% CI: 0.10-0.58] for serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and total iron-binding capacity, respectively. These iron indices were also related to the risk of ARDS, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high cytokine concentrations. Conclusions: Patients with low serum iron status likely suffered from severe condition and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19. The iron metabolism parameters might be risk factors and clinical biomarkers for COVID-19 prognosis.\nDocument [3]: Title: Optimal serum ferritin level range: iron status measure and inflammatory biomarker Abstract: This report provides perspectives concerning dual roles of serum ferritin as a measure of both iron status and inflammation. We suggest benefits of a lower range of serum ferritin as has occurred for total serum cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels. Observations during a prospective randomized study using phlebotomy in patients with peripheral arterial disease offered unique insights into dual roles of serum ferritin both as an iron status marker and acute phase reactant. Robust positive associations between serum ferritin, interleukin 6 [IL-6], tissue necrosis factor-alpha, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were discovered. Elevated serum ferritin and IL-6 levels associated with increased mortality and with reduced mortality at ferritin levels <100 ng mL-1. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate similar outcomes. Extremely elevated ferritin and IL-6 levels also occur in individuals with high mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disordered iron metabolism reflected by a high range of serum ferritin level signals disease severity and outcomes. Based upon experimental and epidemiologic data, we suggest testing the hypotheses that optimal ferritin levels for cardiovascular mortality reduction range from 20 to 100 ng mL-1 with % transferrin levels from 20 to 50%, to ensure adequate iron status and that ferritin levels above 194 ng mL-1 associate with all-cause mortality in population cohorts.\nDocument [4]: Title: Iron metabolism in infections: Focus on COVID-19 Abstract: Iron is a micronutrient essential for a wide range of metabolic processes in virtually all living organisms. During infections, a battle for iron takes place between the human host and the invading pathogens. The liver peptide hepcidin, which is phylogenetically and structurally linked to defensins (antimicrobial peptides of the innate immunity), plays a pivotal role by subtracting iron to pathogens through its sequestration into host cells, mainly macrophages. While this phenomenon is well studied in certain bacterial infections, much less is known regarding viral infections. Iron metabolism also has implications on the functionality of cells of the immune system. Once primed by the contact with antigen presenting cells, lymphocytes need iron to sustain the metabolic burst required for mounting an effective cellular and humoral response. The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted an amount of clinical and translational research over the possible influences of nutrients on SARS-CoV-2 infection, in terms of either susceptibility or clinical course. Here we review the intersections between iron metabolism and COVID-19, belonging to the wider domain of the so-called nutritional immunity. A better understanding of such connections has potential broad implications, either from a mechanistic standpoint, or for the development of more effective strategies for managing COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.\nDocument [5]: Title: Ferritin - from iron, through inflammation and autoimmunity, to COVID-19. Abstract: While it took decades to arrive to a conclusion that ferritin is more than an indicator of iron storage level, it took a short period of time through the COVID-19 pandemic to wonder what the reason behind high levels of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 might be. Unsurprisingly, acute phase reactant was not a satisfactory explanation. Moreover, the behavior of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 and the subsequent high mortality rates in patients with high ferritin levels necessitated further investigations to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. Ferritin was initially described to accompany various acute infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an acute response to inflammation. However, with the introduction of the hyperferritinemic syndrome connecting four severe pathological conditions such as adult-onset Still''s disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a pathogenetic role rather than an extremely elevated protein only. In fact, suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the pathogenetic role of ferritin. Doubtlessly, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better coping with severe diseases in terms of treatment and prevention of complications. The origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various pathological and clinical processes are presented hereby in our article. In addition, the implications of ferritin in COVID-19 are addressed.\nDocument [6]: Title: Therapeutic potential of induced iron depletion using iron chelators in Covid-19 Abstract: Ferritin, which includes twenty-four light and heavy chains in varying proportions in different tissues, is primarily responsible for maintaining the body''s iron metabolism. Its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngmL-1 in men and between 30 and 300 ngmL-1 in women. Iron is delivered to the tissue via them, and they act as immunomodulators, signaling molecules, and inflammatory markers. When ferritin level exceeds 1000 µgL-1, the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia. Iron chelators such as deferiprone, deferirox, and deferoxamine are currently FDA approved to treat iron overload. The inflammation cascade and poor prognosis of COVID-19 may be attributed to high ferritin levels. Critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox, an iron chelator administered orally at 20-40 mgkg-1 once daily, as well as intravenous deferoxamine at 1000 mg initially followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 h. It can be combined with monoclonal antibodies, antioxidants, corticosteroids, and lactoferrin to make iron chelation therapy effective for COVID-19 victims. In this article, we analyze the antiviral and antifibrotic activity of iron chelators, thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a potentially innovative treatment strategy for COVID-19.\nDocument [7]: Title: Iron Related Biomarkers Predict Disease Severity in a Cohort of Portuguese Adult Patients during COVID-19 Acute Infection Abstract: Large variability in COVID-19 clinical progression urges the need to find the most relevant biomarkers to predict patients'' outcomes. We evaluated iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients admitted to the main hospital of the northern region of Portugal with variable clinical pictures, from September to November 2020. One hundred and twenty-seven tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 176 tested negative. Iron-related laboratory parameters and cytokines were determined in blood samples collected soon after admission. Demographic data, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients were assigned into five groups according to severity. Serum iron and transferrin levels at admission were lower in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were increased in COVID-19-positive patients. The lowest serum iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were associated with the worst outcomes. Iron levels negatively correlated with IL-6 and higher levels of this cytokine were associated with a worse prognosis. Serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were higher in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients. Serum iron is the simplest laboratory test to be implemented as a predictor of disease progression in COVID-19-positive patients.\nDocument [8]: Title: H-Ferritin Produced by Myeloid Cells Is Released to the Circulation and Plays a Major Role in Liver Iron Distribution during Infection Abstract: During infections, the host redistributes iron in order to starve pathogens from this nutrient. Several proteins are involved in iron absorption, transport, and storage. Ferritin is the most important iron storage protein. It is composed of variable proportions of two peptides, the L- and H-ferritins (FTL and FTH). We previously showed that macrophages increase their expression of FTH1 when they are infected in vitro with Mycobacterium avium, without a significant increase in FTL. In this work, we investigated the role of macrophage FTH1 in M. avium infection in vivo. We found that mice deficient in FTH1 in myeloid cells are more resistant to M. avium infection, presenting lower bacterial loads and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines than wild-type littermates, due to the lower levels of available iron in the tissues. Importantly, we also found that FTH1 produced by myeloid cells in response to infection may be found in circulation and that it plays a key role in iron redistribution. Specifically, in the absence of FTH1 in myeloid cells, increased expression of ferroportin is observed in liver granulomas and increased iron accumulation occurs in hepatocytes. These results highlight the importance of FTH1 expression in myeloid cells for iron redistribution during infection.\nDocument [9]: Title: RETRACTED ARTICLE: Evaluation of ferritin level in COVID-19 patients and its inflammatory response Abstract: None\nDocument [10]: Title: Trace element homeostasis in the neurological system after SARS-CoV-2 infection: Insight into potential biochemical mechanisms Abstract: Background: Several studies have suggested that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can affect several organs, including the brain. In the brain, specifically, viral infection can cause dyshomeostasis of some trace elements that promote complex biochemical reactions in specialized neurological functions. Objective: Understand the neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 and the relationship between trace elements and neurological disorders after infection, and provide new insights on the drug development for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: The main databases were used to search studies published up September 2021, focusing on the role of trace elements during viral infection and on the correct functioning of the brain. Results: The imbalance of important trace elements can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 neurovirulence and increase the neurotoxicity since many neurological processes can be associated with the homeostasis of metal and metalloproteins. Some studies involving animals and humans have suggested the synapse as a vulnerable region of the brain to neurological disorders after viral infection. Considering the combined evidence, some mechanisms have been suggested to understand the relationship between neurological disorders and imbalance of trace elements in the brain after viral infection. Conclusion: Trace elements play important roles in viral infections, such as helping to activate immune cells, produce antibodies, and inhibit virus replication. However, the relationship between trace elements and virus infections is complex since the specific functions of several elements remain largely undefined. Therefore, there is still a lot to be explored to understand the biochemical mechanisms involved between trace elements and viral infections, especially in the brain.\n"
