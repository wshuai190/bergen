Potty Genius Blog Potty Training Schedule: How Long Should It Take? Additional Potty Training Schedule: What do you think? Content: Parents have reported a potty training schedule of 6 months of age using the elimination communication method. This method is intriguing for parents who want to decrease the economic and environmental impact of diapers. However, physicians such as Dr. Steve Hodges warn against early potty training, stating that it may lead children to hold it for too long and increase the risks of urinary tract infections, constipation, bedwetting, and frequent accidents. Eliminating diapers early tends to work best in cultures where people squat to pee and children aren’t responsible for taking themselves to the toilet. Toddlers who are potty trained may delay eliminating to not interrupt their playtime and end up holding it for too long, which creates more problems down the road. For this reason, parents who potty train early should be available to take their child to the potty at scheduled intervals to avoid this issue. This may not be the best method for children who are in daycare or lack a solid daily routine with consistent caregiver involvement. Ultimately, potty training is a personal journey for each parent and child. Like any developmental milestone, children will reach it in their own time, with some kids taking longer than others. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends assessing a child’s readiness before introducing any potty training method.\nDocument [18]: Title: How to Potty Train a Stubborn Toddler | WonderBaby.org Headings: How to Potty Train a Stubborn Toddler How to Potty Train a Stubborn Toddler POTTY TRAINING! Beginning Potty Training: The Parent’s Q&A The Potty Training Shopping List Preparing for Potty Training The Step-By-Step Guide to Potty Training Here’s a Fun Tip: What are your thoughts? Content: When it’s time to sit on the potty, don’t ask your child if he has to go potty because the answer will usually be no. Just take him to the potty and sit him on it. Sit him on the potty until he goes or for a reasonable amount of time (5 minutes). After sitting on the potty, set a timer for 30 minutes if he didn’t potty, 1 hour if he did. Sit on the potty when the timer goes off (this way the timer is the one saying it’s time to sit on the potty, not you). Drink lots of fluids. Wear underwear and clothes that are easy to get on and off. Many parents potty train their kids with no pants at all just so that they can focus on the potty and not the clothes. If your child is completely naked for potty training (at least on the bottom), accidents will be much more obvious to them. Summer is a great time to potty train because of warmer weather.\nDocument [19]: Title: When Your Toddler Isn\'t Pooping When Potty Training Headings: When Your Toddler Isn\'t Pooping When Potty Training When Your Toddler Isn\'t Pooping When Potty Training Make Pooping on the Potty Easier Provide a Footrest Create a Routine Prevent Constipation Reduce Stress Help Your Child Learn to Poop on the Potty Ask for Help Content: Create a Routine Have your child sit on the toilet at about the same time every day. If there is a time of day that they have typically been pooping in their diaper, choose this time to have them sit on the toilet. The introduction of food into the stomach sends signals to the colon that make you want to poop (this is called the gastro-colic reflex). So having your child sit on the toilet right after breakfast every day is often a good idea, as the body is primed for pooping then. Prevent Constipation If your child has bowel movements that are sometimes big, hard and painful to pass, then they may just be afraid to use the potty to have BMs. Constipation often leads to potty training problems. 2 \ufeff\ufeff Make sure your child is drinking plenty of water and has enough fiber in their diet. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 7 grams of fiber per day for 2-year-olds and 8 grams for 3-year-olds: their age plus 5.
