These include vitamins C, D, and E, as well as certain B vitamins like thiamine, nicotinic acid, and riboflavin. For instance, vitamin C can help reduce pain and inflammation by boosting collagen production. Vitamin D can assist calcium absorption, leading to stronger muscles. Vitamin E can protect against damage caused by free radicals, which can occur with aging, leading to muscle strength and weakened immune system problems. In addition, B vitamins play a role in pain relief and cell division for repair, such as vitamin B1, which can improve nerve health. Furthermore, maintaining good nutrition through a balanced diet is helpful, as it seals up the injured site quickly.",

                "text": "If you're experiencing nausea caused by antibiotics, there are several strategies that may help alleviate the symptoms. Firstly, taking the medication after food may help reduce nausea and gastrointestinal upset. This is because food can stimulate gastric acid secretion, which aids in digestion, and delay stomach emptying, allowing the medication to release slower into the GI tract. \n\nFurthermore, probiotics can be beneficial in restoring the balance of good bacteria in the digestive system that may have been disrupted by the antibiotics. You can consider taking probiotic supplements, eating fermented foods such as yogurt or kefir, or drinking probiotic drinks. Probiotics can help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and stave off yeast infections. \n\nAdditionally, ginger tea, ginger-based drinks, or probiotics may also help soothe the stomach and alleviate nausea. Eating small, frequent meals and choosing bland foods like crackers, plain bread, or white rice can also be helpful in allowing the stomach to digest food gradually and giving the gastrointestinal tract a chance to recover.\n\nAvoiding caffeinated drinks like coffee or tea, spicy foods, and fried foods may also reduce nausea. Apple cider vinegar, on the other hand, has antibacterial properties that may help combat harmful bacteria.\n\nIt's worth noting that while some general advice may be helpful, always follow the specific advice of your healthcare provider, especially if you experience severe or persistent symptoms.\n\nContributing factors that may cause nausea may include a significant disruption in the normal balance of bacteria in your intestine while taking antibiotics, with symptoms such as bloating, nausea, and diarrhea possibly being transient.\n\nInformation from Document [18] indicates that people often complain of stomach upset or nausea due to the medication's effect on disrupting the normal balance of good and bad bacteria, which can then cause the mentioned symptoms.",
