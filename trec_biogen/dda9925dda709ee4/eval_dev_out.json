Abstract: There is a paucity of empirical data establishing the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with mental retardation and psychiatric disorders. This study examines the efficacy of ECT on specific symptoms and between psychiatric diagnoses in patients with mental retardation who are psychiatrically ill. A chart review was performed on 20 inpatients who had received ECT on a dedicated Mental Retardation-Dual Diagnosis Unit and were divided into 3 categories: mood disorders (n = 12), psychotic disorders (n = 6), and intermittent explosive disorder (n = 2). Ratings were performed 1 week before ECT treatment and 1-week after its termination using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale. A repeated-measures analysis of variance comparing Aberrant Behavior Checklist scale scores revealed a significant time-by-treatment interaction (F = 75.43, df = 1,9, P = 0.000, 2 t). The mood disorder and psychotic disorder groups had significantly lower irritability and hyperactivity scores after treatment compared with the intermittent explosive disorder group. The Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale rating scores showed significant improvement in the mood disorders group (67%), in contrast to the intermittent explosive disorder group (0%). Our data suggests the utility of ECT for patients with mental retardation who also have treatment-resistant mood disorders and psychotic disorders, particularly with symptoms of hyperactivity and irritability. The data are sufficiently encouraging to justify prospective research of this question.\nDocument [2]: Title: Intermittent explosive disorder as a disorder of impulsive aggression for DSM-5. Abstract: A disorder of impulsive aggression has been included in DSM since the first edition. In DSM-III, this disorder was codified as intermittent explosive disorder, and it was thought to be rare. However, the diagnostic criteria for the disorder were poorly operationalized, and empirical research was limited until research criteria were developed a decade ago. Subsequently, renewed interest in disorders of impulsive aggression led to a recent series of community-based studies that have documented intermittent explosive disorder to be as common as many other psychiatric disorders. Other recent research indicates that compared with DSM-IV criteria for intermittent explosive disorder, research criteria for the disorder better identify individuals with elevated levels of aggression, impulsivity, familial risk of aggression, and abnormalities in neurobiological markers of aggression. In addition, other data strongly suggest important delimitation from other disorders previously thought to obscure the diagnostic uniqueness of intermittent explosive disorder. Overall, these data suggest that the diagnostic validity for the integrated research criteria is substantial and is now sufficient for recognition and inclusion in DSM-5.\nDocument [3]: Title: Latent structure of intermittent explosive disorder in an epidemiological sample. Abstract: Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is characterized by distinct periods of impulsive aggression marked by assaultive acts or destruction of property. However, impulsive aggression is also a feature of other disorders, all of which are viewed in diagnostic nomenclature as qualitatively distinct from IED. This state of affairs is problematic for categorical models unless it is demonstrated empirically that IED-related impulsive aggression is qualitatively distinct from impulsive aggression observable in other axis I and II disorders. The current study addresses this question using taxometric methods to examine the latent structure of IED. Participants were respondents on the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Surveys, which obtained data on a range of disorders including intermittent explosive disorder (N=20,013) and a range of psychological variables. Indicator variables used were drawn from the survey items and submitted to select taxometric methods (MAMBAC and MAXEIG) to determine the relative fits of a taxonic versus dimensional model. The results of taxometric analyses provided support for a taxonic, rather than dimensional, structure for IED symptoms in the epidemiological sample. Taxon group membership was associated with treatment seeking, family history of anger attacks, lower age of onset of anger attacks, and male biological sex, providing strong support for the validity of the IED taxon.\nDocument [4]: Title: Major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms in intermittent explosive disorder. Abstract: It is estimated that between 1.7 and 2.6 million people have had intermittent explosive disorder (IED) during their life in the United States alone. Co-occurring psychiatric disorders are very common in IED, being major depressive disorder arguably the most common. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical correlates of IED and depressive manifestations in 74 treatment-seeking subjects. After controlling for confounders, there were associations between major depressive disorder and severity of depressive symptoms, and (a) higher assault scores, (b) more severe hostile behavior and (c) worse social adjustment. Management of depressive symptoms may be an important for IED treatment.\nDocument [5]: Title: Suicidal behavior and aggression-related disorders. Abstract: Studies of suicidal behavior among those with aggression-related disorders (i.e. intermittent explosive disorder, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and conduct disorder) were examined. The presence of an aggressive disorder generally increased the risk of suicide attempts and mortality, with this effect (when examined) usually existing independent of other psychopathology. However, this may not be the case for antisocial personality disorder. Furthermore, with the exception of intermittent explosive disorder, the extant research suggests severity of aggression was associated with suicide attempt risk in aggression-related disorders. Future research is needed to better understand what mechanisms may influence the suicide-aggression relationship.\nDocument [6]: Title: Prevalence of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder in Black adolescents: Findings from the National Survey of American Life, Adolescent Supplement. Abstract: Little is known about the epidemiology of <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (4th ed.; <i>DSM&#8211;IV</i>) intermittent explosive disorder (IED) in adolescents, and no information is currently available regarding the relationship between race/ethnicity and IED among Black youth in the United States. Using the World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Adolescent Version), we estimated the prevalence, severity, and disability of IED in a national, probability sample of African American and Caribbean Black youth (ages 13&#8211;17) from the National Survey of American Life, Adolescent Supplement. Face-to-face surveys of 810 African American and 360 Caribbean Black youth were conducted between 2001 and 2003. We calculated lifetime and 12-month diagnoses of IED using diagnostic algorithms based on <i>DSM&#8211;IV</i> and assessed IED disability using a modified Sheehan Disability Scale. Overall findings indicated lifetime and 12-month IED prevalence rates of 9.2% and 7.0%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence rates of IED were 9.0% for African American and 12.4% for Caribbean Black teens. Within the past 12 months, 6.7% of African American and 11.5% of Caribbean Black adolescents met diagnostic criteria for IED. Lifetime and 12-month IED were associated with anxiety disorders. In addition, few teens with lifetime IED received any treatment. Findings are consistent with recent evidence that intermittent explosive disorder may be more common than previously considered, especially among adolescents. Significant acts of aggression and impairment are associated with IED, and low treatment rates indicate that more research on this disorder and intervention options is warranted.\nDocument [7]: Title: Predictors of treatment outcome in cognitive behavioral therapy for intermittent explosive disorder: A preliminary analysis. Abstract: The present study examined potential treatment outcome predictors of a multicomponent cognitive behavioral intervention for intermittent explosive disorder (IED).\nDocument [8]: Title: Deep brain stimulation of the orbitofrontal projections for the treatment of intermittent explosive disorder. Abstract: Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is characterized by a dysfunction in the greater limbic system leading an individual to experience sudden aggressive behavior with little or no environmental perturbation. This report describes a procedure for the treatment of IED in a 19-year-old woman with a history of IED, having had episodes of severe violent attacks against family, dating to early childhood. Due to the severity and intractability of the illness, deep brain stimulation was performed, targeting the orbitofrontal projections to the hypothalamus. The patient's history and the procedure, management, and rationale are described in detail.\nDocument [9]: Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Changes Associated with Intermittent Explosive Disorder: A Gene-Based Functional Enrichment Analysis. Abstract: Intermittent explosive disorder is defined as a recurrent, problematic, and impulsive aggression that affects 3% to 4% of the US population. While behavioral genetic studies report a substantial degree of genetic influence on aggression and impulsivity, epigenetic mechanisms underlying aggression and intermittent explosive disorder are not well known.\nDocument [10]: Title: Intermittent explosive disorder and eating disorders: Analysis of national comorbidity and research samples.

This study examined the pattern of comorbidity between intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and eating disorders (ED).\nDocument [11]: Title: Prevalence and features of intermittent explosive disorder in a clinical setting. Abstract: To determine the lifetime and current prevalence, along with other characteristics such as age at onset, patterns of comorbidity, and interest in treatment, of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder (IED) in an outpatient psychiatric sample.\nDocument [12]: Title: Dandy-Walker malformation and intermittent explosive disorder: A case report. Abstract: Dandy-Walker malformation is a group of brain malformations that sometimes present with psychotic features, violent and impulsive behavior, or mood symptoms. Here, we present a case report of a patient with Dandy-Walker malformation who presented with intermittent explosive disorder. A young man, aged 18 years, was brought to the author's hospital [Hamad Medical Corporation] with anger outbursts, irritable mood, and violent behavior. His magnetic resonance imaging scans showed typical alterations of Dandy-Walker malformation. He also had mild intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. After a few weeks of treatment with sodium valproate 1000 mg/day and risperidone 2 mg/day, his condition improved, and his violent behavior was significantly reduced in 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of follow-up. There is broad consensus that Dandy-Walker malformation is associated with psychosis and other behavioral abnormalities because of a possible disruption in the prefrontal, thalamic, and cerebellar circuits. The link between Dandy-Walker malformation and intermittent explosive disorder may help us understand this type of brain malformation as a potential psychiatric comorbidity.\nDocument [13]: Title: Achieving convergence between a community-based measure of explosive anger and a clinical interview for intermittent explosive disorder in Timor-Leste. Abstract: There is growing research interest in understanding and analyzing explosive forms of anger. General epidemiological studies have focused on the DSM-IV category of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), while refugee and post-conflict research have used culturally-based indices of explosive anger. The aim of this study was to test the convergence of a culturally-sensitive community measure of explosive anger with a structured clinical interview diagnosis of IED in Timor-Leste, a country with a history of significant mass violence and displacement.\nDocument [14]: Title: Evidence for the taxonic latent structure for DSM-5 intermittent explosive disorder in adults. Abstract: Identification of individuals with clinically significant aggressive behavior is critical for the prevention and management of human aggressive behavior. A previous population-based taxometric study reported that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th Edition (DSM-IV) intermittent explosive disorder (IED) belongs to its own discrete class (taxon) rather than existing along a continuum.\nDocument [15]: Title: Intermittent explosive disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement. Abstract: Epidemiologic studies of adults show that DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is a highly prevalent and seriously impairing disorder. Although retrospective reports in these studies suggest that IED typically begins in childhood, no previous epidemiologic research has directly examined the prevalence or correlates of IED among youth.\nDocument [16]: Title: History of childhood maltreatment in intermittent explosive disorder and suicidal behavior. Abstract: Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is a relatively common disorder of impulsive aggression that typically emerges by adulthood. Maltreatment in childhood (CM) may contribute to the development of IED, but little is known about the association between CM and IED, including about how subtypes of CM may specifically relate to IED. This study aimed to test the association between CM and IED diagnosis. A second aim was to examine history of CM in suicide attempters, and to explore whether impulsivity and aggression account for the relationship between CM and suicide attempt (SA). Adults with Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED; n = 264), with non-IED psychiatric (Axis I or II) disorders (psychiatric controls; PC; n = 199), and with no psychiatric disorder (healthy control subjects; HC; n = 185) were assessed for history of childhood maltreatment, aggression, impulsivity, and history of SA. IED subjects reported significantly greater CM compared to PC and HC subjects, and suicide attempters (n = 62) reported greater CM compared to non-attempters (n = 586). Physical abuse in childhood was independently associated with IED, while sexual abuse and emotional abuse were independently associated with SA. Impulsivity and aggression were potential mediators of the relationship between physical abuse and IED and emotional abuse and SA, but sexual abuse was associated with SA independently of aggression and impulsivity. The results suggest pathways by which environmental factors may influence impulsivity and aggression and, in turn, clinically significant self- and other-directed aggression.\nDocument [17]: Title: Association between problematic Internet use and impulse control disorders among Iranian university students. Abstract: Previous studies have examined the relationship between problematic Internet use (PIU) with pathological gambling and impulsivity. However, few studies have investigated the association between PIU and other impulse control disorders. This study aimed to assess whether PIU is related to compulsive buying, kleptomania, trichotillomania, intermittent explosive disorder, and pyromania, among a sample of Iranian university students. A cross-sectional study design was used among a random sample of (n=950) university students. Self-reported questionnaires, including demographic, Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire (PIUQ) and Minnesota Impulse Disorders Interview were utilized. The prevalence of PIU was 21.2 percent. Students with diagnosis of either compulsive buying, or intermittent explosive disorder, or pyromania had significantly higher scores on PIUQ compared to the students without the diagnosis. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that in the male gender, the diagnosis of either compulsive buying or intermittent explosive disorder were significant predictors of the risk of the PIU. The results support the proposal that PIU should be considered as a spectrum of impulse control disorder.\nDocument [18]: Title: [Intermittent explosive disorder: current status]. Abstract: Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is a recently reported mental disorder. It was introduced in the edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders. Since then, the clinical criteria have developed, but some ambiguity has remained.\nDocument [19]: Title: Prevalence and psychiatric comorbidities of intermittent explosive disorders in Metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a cutaneous capillary malformation on a limb in association with soft tissue swelling with or without bony hypertrophy and atypical varicosity. The capillary malformation associated with KTS is port wine stain. Angiokeratoma circumscriptum naeviforme (ACN) is a congenital variant of angiokeratoma commonly present on the lower limb as a hyperkeratotic plaque. ACN is rarely associated with KTS. We report a case of ACN with soft tissue hypertrophy and deep venous malformation (possibly a variant of Klippel-Trenaunay) in a 4-year-old male child.\nDocument [2]: Title: Presentation and Management of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome: A Review of Available Data. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare and sporadic congenital disorder, characterized by the classical triad of port-wine stains, varicosities along with bone and soft tissue hypertrophy. Symptoms of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome include pain, swelling, lymphedema, bleeding, superficial thrombophlebitis, and deep vein thrombosis. The etiology remains indistinct and has been attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. In most cases, a thorough history and clinical examination is enough for the diagnosis of Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome. However, when certain complications are present, noninvasive imaging techniques are used for the diagnosis and evaluation of the disease in patients. Due to the diversity of presentation, a multidisciplinary approach is essential for the proper management of such patients. At present, there is no cure for the disease; rather, symptomatic treatment is employed in order to improve the patients' quality of life. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the clinicopathological profile and management of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome.\nDocument [3]: Title: Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome With Atypical Presentation of Small Port-Wine Stain. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital capillary/venous malformation (CVM) disorder associated with deep soft-tissue swelling. A seven-year-old Caucasian male with a history of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation and treatment of mildly edematous right lower extremity and varicose veins with multiple, small port-wine stains and nodules. Typically, cases of KTS report large port-wine stains, where a multidisciplinary approach is the mainstay for management. However, this case involves a clinical presentation of mild KTS with atypical, <i>small</i> port-wine stains on the affected limb.\nDocument [4]: Title: Limb hyperplasia: case report of an unusual variant of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and review of the literature. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare disorder involving a triad of cutaneous capillary malformations (port-wine stain), varicose veins or venous malformations, and bony or soft tissue hyperplasia of an extremity. It is one of many heterogeneous disorders known as overgrowth syndromes that are characterized by either generalized or localized somatic overgrowth. Overgrowth syndromes each have unique clinical, behavioral, and genetic features, but some of these features overlap, causing diagnostic difficulty. Cutaneous manifestations, however, can be key to distinguishing the various syndromes. We present a patient with an unusual variant of KTS consisting of right upper extremity hyperplasia, lymphedema, and cutaneous and visceral lymphangiomas. We review several closely related syndromes and discuss the differential diagnosis of limb hyperplasia.\nDocument [5]: Title: Identification of association of common AGGF1 variants with susceptibility for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome using the structure association program. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a severe congenital disorder characterized by capillary malformations, venous malformations or varicose veins, and hypertrophy of the affected tissues. The angiogenic factor gene AGGF1 was previously identified as a candidate susceptibility gene for KTS, but further genetic studies are needed to firmly establish the genetic relationship between AGGF1 and KTS. We analyzed HapMap data and identified two tagSNPs, rs13155212 and rs7704267 that capture information for all common variants in AGGF1. The two SNPs were genotyped in 173 Caucasian KTS patients and 477 Caucasian non-KTS controls, and both significantly associated with susceptibility for KTS (P= 0.004 and 0.013, respectively). Permutation testing also showed a significant empirical P value for the association (empirical P= 0.006 and 0.015, respectively). To control for potential confounding due to population stratification, the population structure for both cases and controls was characterized by genotyping of 38 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) and the STRUCTURE program. The association between the AGGF1 SNPs and KTS remained significant after multivariate analysis by incorporating the inferred cluster scores as a covariate or after removal of outlier individuals identified by STRUCTURE. These results suggest that common AGGF1 variants confer risk of KTS.\nDocument [6]: Title: Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome with Arterio-veno-lymphatic Malformation: A Rare Presentation. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare disorder characterized by triad of vascular malformations, varicose veins, and bony or soft tissue hypertrophy involving an extremity. Port wine stain is the most common vascular malformation associated with this syndrome. Various other rare vascular malformations described are angiokeratomas, angiokeratoma circumscriptum naeviformae, angiodermatitis, etc. This is the first instance, to the best of our knowledge, describing the capillary, venous, and lymphatic malformations in a same case of KTS.\nDocument [7]: Title: Case Report: Primary Pleural Angiosarcoma in a Patient With Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) was demonstrated as a mosaic activating PIK3CA mutations related overgrowth syndrome. We present the first case of primary pleural angiosarcoma in a 17-year-old woman with a history of KTS. The combined targeted DNA and RNA sequencing revealed an activating mutation in PIK3CA in the tumor tissue. Our case suggested an association and perhaps a causal link between the two different PIK3CA-related genetic diseases.\nDocument [8]: Title: Orthopaedic diagnoses in patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare combined vascular malformation composed of capillary malformation, lymphatic and/or venous malformation and limb overgrowth, which commonly affects the extremities. Due to limb involvement, it is not uncommon for these patients to require referral to an orthopaedic surgeon. Herein we reviewed the prevalence of orthopaedic diagnoses in a large cohort of KTS patients and described the associated surgical interventions.\nDocument [9]: Title: Wound-Healing Problems Associated with Combined Vascular Malformations in Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome. Abstract: <b>Significance:</b> In Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), management of a wound in the affected limb can be difficult because of the underlying vascular malformations present. This review describes the characteristics of KTS with wound complications in light of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the disease. <b>Recent Advances:</b> KTS is a slow-flow combined vascular malformation characterized by the triad of capillary malformation, venous malformation with or without lymphatic malformation, and limb overgrowth. KTS is encompassed within the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (<i>PIK3CA</i>)-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), having recently been linked to activating mutations in the <i>PIK3CA</i> gene. This clearly has implications for both molecular diagnosis and potential treatment strategies for the disease. <b>Critical Issues:</b> KTS should be distinguished from Parkes Weber syndrome, a fast-flow-type combined vascular malformation with limb overgrowth. Individualized management is needed for KTS and should be focused on the treatment of symptoms. <b>Future Directions:</b> Targeted therapies that inhibit the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway are a potential treatment option for PROS.\nDocument [10]: Title: Case Report: Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome - Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism and Vascular Malformation. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare genetic vascular disorder characterized by a limb affected by varicose veins, port wine stains, and hypertrophy of bone and soft tissue. It can also present with vascular malformations in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, genitourinary tract, and heart. We present a 27-year-old case of KTS diagnosed in adulthood associated with recurrent venous thromboembolism and gastrointestinal bleeding.\nDocument [11]: Title: Klippel-Trenaunay and Sturge-Weber Overlap Syndrome with KRAS and GNAQ mutations. Abstract: Patients with combined phenotypes of Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome have been reported, though the underlying genetic spectrum in these individuals remains to be elucidated. We reported the patient presenting with Klippel-Trenaunay and Sturge-Weber overlap syndrome in mainland China. Histopathologic study confirmed the hemangioma of vein and capillary. Co-existence of a novel somatic KRAS c.182_183 delins TC mutation and GNAQ c.548G>A mutation was identified in the affected skin tissue rather than paired peripheral blood. The somatic mutations of GNAQ and KRAS may affect MAPK-ERK signaling pathway, resulting in endothelial anomaly and blood vessel malformation.\nDocument [12]: Title: Pulmonary thromboembolism associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by unilateral limb overgrowth, venous varicosities, and capillary malformations (port wine stains) of the affected limb or limbs. Large venous malformations such as those observed in KTS are rare, and many physicians are unfamiliar with the potential complications, which include hypercoagulability, thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). As a result, patients may suffer from delayed diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening thromboembolic event. We present 2 cases of children with KTS complicated by PE, and we review the English-language literature regarding pathophysiologic features, interventions, and outcomes of PE in the setting of KTS among both pediatric and adult patients, with emphasis on issues relevant to pediatricians.\nDocument [13]: Title: Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome: Employment of a New Endovascular Treatment Technique-Mechanochemical Ablation Using the Flebogrif System. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is characterized by a triad of symptoms; varicose veins and venous malformations (VMs), capillary malformations (port-wine stain), and soft tissue and bone hypertrophy. Herein, we retrospectively studied six patients with KTS who underwent treatment with the Flebogrif system and evaluated their outcomes.\nDocument [14]: Title: Conus medullaris-cauda arteriovenous malformation and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: what is the treatment goal? Abstract: A 29-year-old man with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) presented with a symptomatic conus medullaris-cauda arteriovenous malformation (AVM) manifesting as back and right limb pain, which abruptly worsened with the onset of right limb weakness and urinary retention. He was treated by multisession endovascular embolization resulting in improved neurological status. KTS is a sporadic disease with unknown etiology, but genetic susceptibility may lead to the over-expression of angiogenic factors and increased angiogenesis. KTS may be exceptionally associated with slow-flow spinal AVM, but there is no consensus about the optimal treatment for these symptomatic lesions. Embolization treatment may represent a safe option to minimize complications and possibly improve the neurological status in patients with spinal AVM associated with KTS, if one or both legs are already impaired by hypertrophy or other vascular malformations. Genetic analysis may reveal an underlying angiogenesis change, so closer follow up might be indicated in selected patients.\nDocument [15]: Title: Subcutaneous Cavernous Haemangioma in a Patient with Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome: A Case Report.

With the purpose of determining the actual significance of venous impairment in patients with KTS, we quantified the venous valvular competency and calf muscle pump function and examined their effect on clinical severity.\nDocument [17]: Title: Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome: Case series from a university hospital of Nepal. Abstract: Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital malformation with capillary and venous malformations and soft tissue/bony overgrowth with or without lymphatic malformation. Cutaneous vascular stain, varicosities and tissue hypertrophy represent its main clinical features. Besides, the patient can develop thromboembolic pathologies, recurrent bouts of infection, stasis eczema, limb length discrepancy and intolerable pain typical of intraosseous involvement.\nDocument [18]: Title: Prevalence of various congenital vascular malformations in patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a condition defined by the association of three physical features: capillary malformation, varicosities, and hypertrophy of bony and soft tissues. However, KTS is characterized by congenital vascular malformations (CVMs) that are difficult to classify. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to analyze the various CVMs in patients with KTS.\nDocument [19]: Title: Klippel Trenaunay syndrome.

Abstract: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare slow-flow combined vascular malformation characterized by capillary-lymphatic-venous lesions with soft tissue overgrowth of the limbs. We report the case of a 37-year-old female KTS patient with a deep femoral arterial aneurysm. We finally diagnosed that the aneurysm had resulted from a fundamental defect in the arterial wall structure. We discuss whether the use of \"aneurysm associated with KTS\" is accurate and how to better classify this type of capillary-venous lesion in 17 reported KTS patients with arterial aneurysms. In this review, we describe nosological problems of arterial aneurysms associated with KTS.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Golfer's elbow is common in the 40 to 60-year-old age group so those suffering from it are part of the workforce and hence, its economic impact. Women and men alike suffer from golfer's elbow, and microtrauma combined with attritional changes in the common flexor tendon origin at the medial aspect of the elbow are the culprit of this pathology. The first line of treatment is conservative therapy and only when it fails is an open surgical approach utilized. New approaches to treating this ailment such as use of Extra Corporeal Shock Wave therapy and the use of injectable blood derivatives, as well as new surgical techniques are also being applied.\nDocument [2]: Title: Upper extremity injuries in golf. Abstract: Golf is an asymmetric sport with unique patterns of injury depending upon the skill level. Higher handicap players typically experience injuries that result from swing mechanics, whereas lower handicap and professional players have overuse as the major cause of their injuries. The majority of shoulder injuries affecting golfers occur in the nondominant shoulder. Common shoulder injuries include subacromial impingement, rotator cuff pathology, glenohumeral instability, and arthritis involving the acromioclavicular and/or glenohumeral joints. Lead arm elbow pain resulting from lateral epicondylosis (tennis elbow) is the leading upper extremity injury in amateur golfers. Tendon injury is the most common problem seen in the wrist and forearm of the golfer. Rehabilitation emphasizing improvement in core muscle streng is important in the treatment of golf injury. Emerging treatments for tendinopathy include topical nitrates, ultrasound-guided injection of therapeutic substances, and eccentric rehabilitation. There is evidence supporting physiotherapy, and swing modification directed by a teaching professional, for treatment of upper extremity golf injuries. This article focuses on upper extremity injuries in golf, including a discussion of the epidemiology, causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of injuries occurring in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand.\nDocument [3]: Title: Tendinopathies Around the Elbow Part 2: Medial Elbow, Distal Biceps and Triceps Tendinopathies. Abstract: In the second part of this review article the management of medial elbow tendinopathy, distal biceps and distal triceps tendinopathy will be discussed. There is a scarcity of publications concerning any of these tendinopathies. This review will summarise the current best available evidence in their management. Medial elbow tendinopathy, also known as Golfer's elbow, is up to 6 times less common than lateral elbow tendinopathy. The tendinopathy occurs in the insertion of pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis. Diagnosis is usually apparent through a detailed history and examination but care must be made to exclude other conditions affecting the ulnar nerve or less commonly the ulnar collateral ligament complex. If doubt exists then MRI/US and electrophysiology can be used. Treatment follows a similar pattern to that of lateral elbow tendinopathy. Acute management is with activity modification and topical NSAIDs. Injection therapy and surgical excision are utilised for recalcitrant cases. Distal biceps and triceps tendinopathies are very rare and there is limited evidence published. Sequelae of tendinopathy include tendon rupture and so it is vital to manage these tendinopathies appropriately in order to minimise this significant complication. Their management and that of partial tears will be considered.\nDocument [4]: Title: Analysis of ipsilateral and bilateral ratios in male amateur golfers. Abstract: The number of injuries that force golfers to quit is also increasing. In particular, the upper body injuries are concerns for amateur golfers. This study was conducted not only to investigate muscular balance, such as ipsilateral and bilateral ratios of the upper body, but to also evaluate the possible problems of muscular joints in amateur golfers. Male golfers (n=10) and a healthy control group (n=10) were recruited for the assessment of muscular function in the upper body, which was measured by an isokinetic dynamometer at 60\u00b0/sec. The tested parts were trunk, wrist, forearm, elbow, and shoulder joints. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the significance of the differences between groups. The ipsilateral ratios of peak torque or work per repetition (WR) of trunk flexor and extensor in the golfers were not significantly different compared to those of the control group. These results were similar to the shoulder horizontal abductor and adductor. However, there were significant differences in the ipsilateral and bilateral ratios of the wrist, forearm, and elbow joints. Especially, the WR of the wrist flexor, forearm pronator, and elbow flexor on the left side of amateur golfers showed imbalances in bilateral ratios. Moreover, the WR of the wrist and elbow flexors on the left side of amateur golfers were lower than those of the wrist and elbow extensors. Therefore, amateur golfers should strive to prevent injuries of the wrist, forearm, and elbow joints and to reinforce the endurance on those parts of the left side.\nDocument [5]: Title: Nirschl surgical technique for concomitant lateral and medial elbow tendinosis: a retrospective review of 53 elbows with a mean follow-up of 11.7 years. Abstract: Combined lateral elbow tendinosis (tennis elbow) and medial elbow tendinosis (golfer's elbow) can be a disabling condition that, if unresponsive to nonoperative treatments, may be effectively treated surgically. The authors are not aware of any study that reports the outcome of a combined operation for lateral and medial elbow tendinosis (country club elbow) performed in the same operative setting.\nDocument [6]: Title: Elbow Common Flexor Tendon Repair Technique. Abstract: Medial epicondylitis, also known as \"golfer's elbow,\" is a common orthopaedic condition that typically results from overuse of the flexor pronator mass. Repetitive eccentric loading of the muscles responsible for wrist flexion and forearm pronation leads to microtrauma and subsequent degeneration of the flexor pronator tendon. Patients with medial epicondylitis typically present in the fourth to sixth decade of life and have an insidious onset of medial elbow pain. Occasionally, medial epicondylitis may result from an acute traumatic event, such as an acute avulsion of the common flexor tendon. Patients should be examined for concomitant elbow pathologies, including ulnar neuritis and ulnar collateral ligament injury. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can show increased signal intensity in the common flexor tendon or a complete rupture. Nonsurgical management is the mainstay of treatment; however, surgical treatment may be indicated in elite athletes and patients with persistent symptoms after conservative treatment. This technique article with accompanying video describes open debridement and repair of the flexor pronator tendon, with an emphasis on restoration of the anatomic footprint and compression across the repair site to promote biological healing.\nDocument [7]: Title: Arthroscopic treatment of posterolateral elbow impingement from lateral synovial plicae in throwing athletes and golfers. Abstract: Although elbow pain is common in throwing athletes and golfers, posterolateral impingement from a hypertrophic synovial plica is a rare but possibly underdiagnosed condition.\nDocument [8]: Title: When golf hurts: musculoskeletal problems common to golfers. Abstract: Golfers most frequently report injuries to the low back, nondominant shoulder, and elbow. Injury patterns differ between elite and recreational golfers; professional and elite golfers tend to experience golf injury related to overuse while amateur golfers may experience injury related to adverse swing technique and overuse. Therapeutic interventions should include assessment and treatment of deficiencies in the kinetic chain and professional instruction to modify swing technique. Changes in the swing may include instruction in a more efficient technique or shortening the swing to decrease biomechanical forces affecting the injured area.\nDocument [9]: Title: The elbow: diagnosis and treatment of common injuries. Abstract: This article deals with common injuries to the elbow. Elbow anatomy is reviewed. Diagnosis and treatment of pronator syndrome,lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), radial tunnel syndrome, posterior interosseous nerve syndrome, medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow), ulnar collateral ligament injury, cubital tunnel syndrome,posterolateral rotatory instability, distal biceps injuries, tricepstendon injuries, and posterior elbow impingement are discussed.\nDocument [10]: Title: Acute effects of one session dry needling on a chronic golfer's elbow disability. Abstract: A 40-year-old retired male elite athlete with more than 20 years' experience in wrestling and bodybuilding with mild elbow pain and disability of 2 years presented to our clinic reporting an acute pain in medial aspect of the elbow. Physical examination revealed symptoms of left Golfer's elbow during target-directed movements. The results of sonography in left elbow showed low level of hypo echo irregularity and increased blood flow in color Doppler mode in the common flexor origin. The pain amplitude was moderate at rest and extremely high during kinetic and intentional movements. During last 2 years, the patient tried different types of therapy including manual therapy, Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and also received a variety of injections none of which were effective for reducing pain and disability. This is the first study showed that one sessions of dry needling improved both pain and disability and helped to return to a normal life and exercise training.\nDocument [11]: Title: Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy: Can excision of upper trunk neuroma and nerve grafting improve function in babies with adequate elbow flexion at nine months of age? Abstract: Accepted indications for exploration in obstetrical brachial plexus palsy (OBPP) vary by center. Most agree that full elbow flexion against gravity at nine months of age implies high chance of spontaneous recovery and thus excludes a baby from surgical intervention. However, there are certain movements of the shoulder and forearm that may not be used frequently by the infant, but are extremely important functionally as they grow. These movements are difficult to assess in a baby and may lead to some clinicians to recommend conservative treatment, when this cohort of infants may in fact benefit substantially from surgery. A retrospective review was conducted on all infants managed surgically at the Brachial Plexus Center of a major children's hospital from 2009 to 2014. Further analysis identified five patients who had near-normal AMS scores for elbow flexion but who had weakness of shoulder abduction, flexion, external rotation, and/or forearm supination. In contrast to standard conservative management, this cohort underwent exploration, C5-6 neuroma excision, and sural nerve grafting. Data analysis was performed on this group to look for overall improvement in function. During an average follow-up period of 29 months, all patients made substantial gains in motor function of the shoulder and forearm, without loss of elbow flexion or extension, or worsening of overall outcome. In select infants with brachial plexus injuries but near-normal AMS scores for elbow flexion, surgical intervention may be indicated to achieve the best functional outcome.\nDocument [12]: Title: Percutaneous golfer's elbow release under local anesthesia: a prospective study. Abstract: To evaluate the results of percutaneous golfer's elbow release under local anesthesia.\nDocument [13]: Title: Disease Burden of Medial Epicondylitis in the USA Is Increasing: An Analysis of 19,856 Patients From 2007 to 2014. Abstract: Medial epicondylitis (ME), or \"golfer's elbow,\" is often treated initially by conservative means. Up to 15% of recalcitrant cases require surgical intervention, according to small sample populations, but no national study has determined the incidence of the diagnosis or corroborated the rate of surgical intervention.\nDocument [14]: Title: Medial epicondylitis: evaluation and management. Abstract: Medial epicondylitis, often referred to as \"golfer's elbow,\" is a common pathology. Flexor-pronator tendon degeneration occurs with repetitive forced wrist extension and forearm supination during activities involving wrist flexion and forearm pronation. A staged process of pathologic change in the tendon can result in structural breakdown and irreparable fibrosis or calcification. Patients typically report persistent medial-sided elbow pain that is exacerbated by daily activities. Athletes may be particularly symptomatic during the late cocking or early acceleration phases of the throwing motion. Nonsurgical supportive care includes activity modification, NSAIDs, and corticosteroid injections. Once the acute symptomology is alleviated, focus is turned to flexor-pronator mass rehabilitation and injury prevention. Surgical treatment via open techniques is typically reserved for patients with persistent symptoms.\nDocument [15]: Title: Swing kinematics for male and female pro golfers. Abstract: The purpose of the study was to compare golf swing kinematics between female and male professional golfers, with particular focus on areas where different risks of injury exist and variables that may be related to driving distance. Twenty-five LPGA golfers and twenty-five PGA golfers were tested. Customized computer software was developed to analyze kinematic data obtained with an optoelectronic system at 240 Hz. At the peak of back swing, significant differences were found in trunk forward tilt (LPGA: 25 +/- 4 degrees and PGA: 31 +/- 4 degrees ), and in pelvis orientation (LPGA: 49 +/- 8 degrees and PGA: 42 +/- 7 degrees ). Significantly different pelvis rotation at the ball impact was found (LPGA: - 52 +/- 11 degrees and PGA: - 42 +/- 12 degrees ). The LPGA group produced significantly less angular velocities of the club shaft (2049 +/- 512 degrees /s), the left wrist (816 +/- 186 degrees /s), the right wrist (864 +/- 198 degrees /s) and the elbow extension (705 +/- 109 degrees /s) than the PGA group. The results of this study show there are differences in the swing mechanics for men and women at the professional level. Major differences were found at the wrist and elbow, where different incidences of injury were previously reported.\nDocument [16]: Title: [Scanning Technique in Elbow Ultrasonography]. Abstract: This introduction to ultrasound evaluation of the elbow describes the basic scanning planes and contains corresponding high-resolution ultrasound images. The patient and probe positionings are explained in a simplified step-by-step manner using schematic drawings. This standard and simple examination technique seems to be an appropriate way to improve the learning curve of novice musculoskeletal sonographers. In this manuscript, an emphasis is placed on effusion detection, ulnar nerve imaging, and commonly injured tendons assessment. This article also describes some common pitfalls to avoid when starting with musculoskeletal ultrasonography (e.g. positioning issues, unsolicited artifacts). Key words: tendons, elbow tendinopathy, golfer's elbow, tennis elbow, musculoskeletal, protocol, ultrasound, common extensor tendon, common flexor tendon, ulnar nerve.\nDocument [17]: Title: Golf-related sports injuries of the musculoskeletal system. Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of golf-related musculoskeletal injuries. Golfers were retrospectively surveyed through a 50-item questionnaire. Golfers were divided into injured and noninjured groups according to the presence or absence of musculoskeletal injuries. Of the 208 respondents, 64.0% suffered golf-related injuries, most of which were minor injuries caused by overuse in the early 9.9 weeks. According to the anatomical distribution, the most injured parts were upper limbs, spine, trunk, and lower limbs in that order. As for the distribution by part, the hand and wrist were the most vulnerable, and the lateral elbow damage was 3 times more common than the inner elbow. Self-management for injuries was the most common treatment, and regular preventive exercise accounted for 30% of the injured. Overall, more than half of the respondents suffered from musculoskeletal injuries, self-management was the most common, and less than one-third did regular exercise to prevent injuries. Therefore, active management to prevent golf-related musculoskeletal injuries may be necessary.\nDocument [18]: Title: [Soft tissue rheumatism in erderly]. Abstract: Disorders of soft, peri-articular tissues are a common cause of musculoskeletal pain in elderly patients. Nevertheless, most physicians underestimate the role of soft tissue rheumatism in the pathomechanism of the pain. The impairments of soft tissue can not be diagnosed by X-rays examinations, whereas degenerative lesions of joints are easy diagnosed using this method even despite of their uncertain role in producing the symptoms. The incidence of pain syndromes originated from soft tissues differ regarding to the age of patients. In young subjects the incidence of all of them is generally low. Syndromes provoked by overloading during work: repetitive strain syndrome, canal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, golfers elbow, shoulder tendon coin disorders and myofascial pain syndrome are common in middle-aged patients. The morbidity of fibromialgia syndrome is also lower in old people probably as the result of diminished numbers and degenerative changes in nociceptive fibers. The syndromes prevailing in elderly patients include trochanteric syndrome and the pain syndromes provoked by muscle spasm depended on posture abnormalities. In the soft tissue pain syndrome prevention adapted to old age kinesitherapy and avoiding muscle overloading are recommended. Soft tissue pain syndromes are usually treated with non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. In local pain syndromes better results can be obtained by local treatment. Local injections of glikocorticosteroids are usually very effective and safe.\nDocument [19]: Title: Treatment of medial epicondylar tendinopathy in athletes. Abstract: Medial epicondylar tendinopathy, also known as golfer's elbow, is less common than lateral elbow tendinopathy. Overhead throwing athletes and those participating in sports that require repeated forearm pronation and wrist flexion are most commonly affected by this disorder. This problem predominates in amateur as opposed to professional athletes and is also seen more commonly in patients over 40 years of age. This review will begin by outlining the incidence, history, and physical examination of medial epicondylar tendinopathy, including a new clinical test. Imaging modalities, nonoperative, and operative treatments will then be outlined. Finally, future directions will be explored including emerging biological therapies.\nDocument [20]: Title: Effect of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy in combination with autologous platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of elbow tendinopathy. Abstract: Tendinopathy is a common condition of both the athletic and general population and can be associated with significant pain and disability. The ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate along a mesodermal cell lineage, including tenocytes, and secrete various bioactive regenerative and anti-inflammatory molecules has seen them considered as a future reparative therapy for tendinopathy. Preclinical trials with MSCs have shown promising positive functional and structural outcomes in several connective tissue related conditions. A 52-year-old male professional masters golfer presents with a clinical history of common extensor origin tendinopathy of the elbow. Subsequent formal ultrasound showed evidence of a large intrasubstance tear. The patient underwent intratendinous autologous adipose-derived MSC therapy in combination with autologous platelet-rich plasma. Following treatment, the patient reported progressive improvement as measured by the validated Numeric Pain Rating Scale and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation score. Repeat imaging showed successful regeneration of tendon-like tissue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been extensively described in patients following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. There are now questions about what MIS-C may look like in vaccinated children. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has many clinical and laboratory features in common with other inflammatory disorders including Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. Rheumatologic conditions can present with similar musculoskeletal complaints and elevated inflammatory markers. Laboratory markers and clinical symptoms of MIS-C usually improve once therapy is begun. We describe a child with persistent thrombocytopenia as an example of variable presentation of MIS-C in vaccinated children. This case report discusses an atypical progression of MIS-C in a vaccinated child with a known prior positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. She presented with nonspecific abdominal pain and fever and was found to have elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid treatment failed to induce rapid recovery in her clinical condition or thrombocytopenia. Rheumatologic, hematologic, oncologic, and infectious causes were considered and worked up due to the uncertainty of her case and persistence of pancytopenia but ultimately were ruled out with extensive testing and monitoring. It was key to include a broad differential including viral-induced bone marrow suppression, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and malignancy. The spectrum of MIS-C and response to treatment continues to evolve, and prior vaccination in this child's case complicated the clinical picture further. Additional evaluation of MIS-C in vaccinated cases will permit characterization of the range of MIS-C presentation and response to standard therapy.\nDocument [2]: Title: A Rare Case of a Child Diagnosed With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome After COVID-19 Presenting With Renal Infarctions and Transient Blast Cells: A Case Report and Literature Review. Abstract: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) can develop weeks after the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease's clinical spectrum includes persistent febrile illness, features resembling Kawasaki disease, and cytokine storm symptoms. In severe cases, multisystem organ failure and death may result if not treated promptly. This report discusses a rare case of a 13-year-old girl presenting with fever and acute kidney injury (AKI) eight weeks after recovering from COVID-19 who was diagnosed with MIS-C. A 13-year-old female presented with a fever and abdominal pain following a recent COVID-19. A physical examination revealed a febrile, ill-looking child with abdominal tenderness. Pancytopenia, transaminitis, AKI, and a hyperinflammatory state were noted in the initial laboratory workup. Furthermore, blast cells were seen on the peripheral blood smear. Despite appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy for sepsis, she did not show signs of clinical improvement. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple focal areas of hypoattenuating lesions involving both kidneys, suggestive of bilateral renal infarction. Since she met the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for MIS-C diagnosis, a high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) led to a dramatic improvement in the patient's condition and complete recovery from her illness. This case report describes a rare clinical presentation of MIS-C in a child who presented with AKI due to presumably thrombotic events and transient blast cells in blood film secondary to a severe inflammatory process. Further studies are needed to determine the prevalence of thrombotic AKI associated with MIS-C.\nDocument [3]: Title: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Related to SARS-CoV-2. Abstract: Although data on the incidence and severity of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection showed more significant disease among adults and the elderly, a clinical manifestation characterized by a multisystem inflammatory syndrome was described in children (MIS-C). It was initially thought to be specific to children, but recent reports have shown that it can also occur in adults. MIS-C is characterized by a number of multisystemic manifestations resembling other known previously described illnesses, mainly Kawasaki disease, especially in cases with shock, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. Available literature shows that our knowledge of MIS-C is largely incomplete. Its development in strict relation with SARS-CoV-2 infection seems documented and, in most cases, can be considered a post-infectious manifestation secondary to an abnormal immune response for some aspects, similar to that seen in adults several days after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in a minority of cases, a clinical picture with symptoms fulfilling criteria for MIS-C diagnosis develops during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is highly likely that the criteria currently used to diagnose MIS-C are too broad, meaning that children with different diseases are included. As clarity on the pathogenesis of MIS-C is lacking, different therapeutic approaches have been used, but no specific therapy is currently available. Further studies are urgently needed to improve our definition of MIS-C, to define the real impact on child health, and to elucidate the best clinical and therapeutic approach and true prognosis.\nDocument [4]: Title: Suspected Case of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection Presenting as Acute Pancreatitis in a Child With Leukemia. Abstract: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 may present with fever, elevated inflammatory markers, and multiorgan involvement. Although the gastrointestinal system is commonly affected in MIS-C patients, associated necrotizing pancreatitis is rare. We present an 11-year-old boy with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission undergoing maintenance chemotherapy presenting with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. He developed fevers, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, respiratory distress, cytopenias, and coagulopathy, and was found to have markedly elevated inflammatory markers and positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The patient met criteria for MIS-C and was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin with significant clinical improvement. This is the first known reported case of a child with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who met criteria for MIS-C presenting as acute pancreatitis, and highlights the importance of considering a broader differential for pancreatitis in children given the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\nDocument [5]: Title: Rickettsia rickettsii and Rickettsia typhi in hospitalized children diagnosed with Pediatric Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome in Merida, Yucatan. Abstract: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) presents with fever, fatigue, elevated inflammatory markers (acute phase reactants), and a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or positive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, the risk of MIS-C in the pediatric population increased. However, exposure to other viruses and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 positive antibodies in children hospitalized for various pathogen-associated illnesses will also remain common and may complicate differential diagnoses with diseases endemic to the region such as rickettsial diseases. The objective was to highlight the desirability of medical personnel systematically incorporating rickettsiosis as a differential diagnosis for MIS-C when studying a child with fever, non-specific symptoms, and elevated inflammatory markers. In conclusion MIS-C should be considered in children with elevated inflammatory markers when there is a history of COVID-19 and they also meet criteria that have already been established by international agencies, such as CDC and WHO.\nDocument [6]: Title: Expanding the Differential for Alternative Diagnoses in the Workup of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. Abstract: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children are increasingly admitted for MIS-C evaluation, but instead found to have alternative diagnoses.\nDocument [7]: Title: Difficult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia diagnosis in a paediatric patient with mixed presentation of COVID-19 acute respiratory failure and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. Abstract: New diagnoses of leukaemia and other malignancies are recently being made in paediatric patients with COVID-19. The rates of mortality and morbidity in some of these children are expected to be higher. In new cases, concurrent diagnosis can be difficult because multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) and malignancies have similar clinical presentations. We present the case of a preteenage child where the diagnosis of leukaemia was complicated and delayed by a multisystem involvement and an inconclusive bone marrow study. Clinical teams managing children with COVID-19 and MIS-C should suspect leukaemia and other malignancies when the clinical course is complicated and bone marrow suppression is persistent. Prompt diagnosis will allow start of treatment on time, minimising complications.\nDocument [8]: Title: SARS-CoV-2-Associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C): A Case Report from Iraq. Abstract: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to evolve. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare post-COVID-19 complication that affects children with critical outcomes. Few MIS-C reports were available from Arab-Asian ethnicities. We here describe a presentation mimicking a head injury overlapping the manifestations of MIS-C in a child from Iraq. A 10-year-old boy presented with blunt trauma in a shock-like status, and a head injury was suspected. Since he was febrile two days before the trauma, another pathology was assumed. Imaging and laboratory evaluations were performed, and after excluding gross neurosurgical etiology, he was initially treated as a toxic shock syndrome. Meanwhile, he was deteriorating with continuous fever, impaired consciousness, and seizure on the following day. Although not considered initially, close monitoring with a multidisciplinary approach and serial investigations revealed that the child met the criteria of MIS-C. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was shown to be high, while the RT-PCR of COVID-19 was negative. Once he received immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, he improved dramatically. In conclusion, this report aimed to increase awareness about MIS-C among health workers and emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary team approach in Iraq due to the importance of timely treatment.\nDocument [9]: Title: Post-COVID-19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Abstract: The effect of acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on morbidity and mortality in children has been relatively small. If a child presents to my office with persistent fever and systemic hyperinflammation but no known exposure to COVID-19, how likely are they to have multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)? What is currently known about MIS-C and what is the prognosis for children affected by it?\nDocument [10]: Title: Atypical Kawasaki syndrome in COVID-19 infection: a case report of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in a child (MIS-C). Abstract: The emergence of COVID-19 by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has seen evolving data reporting infrequent infection in children and mostly mild disease for children who contract the infection. A severe form of COVID-19 in children recently reported in Europe and North America describes a multisystem inflammation syndrome in children (MIS-C), presenting as toxic-shock-like and Kawasaki-like syndromes. Data on MIS-C in Africa is being documented with recent reports from South Africa and Nigeria in black children, but information on MIS-C in Ghana is yet to be characterized. We report the first case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in a child who tested PCR positive to SARS-CoV2 in a tertiary hospital in Ghana. The case describes a 10-year-old boy who reported Kawasaki-like syndrome without shock but with moderate respiratory distress requiring supportive acute care without the need for intensive care.\nDocument [11]: Title: Severe Neurological Manifestation in a Child with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we followed with concern the evolution of several children diagnosed with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The purpose of this study is to describe the evolution of MIS-C in a previously healthy 3-year-old girl.\nDocument [12]: Title: Brugada Pattern in a Child with Severe SARS-CoV-2 Related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. Abstract: This report presents the first case of Brugada pattern complicated by a supraventricular arrhythmia in a child with SARS-CoV-2 related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). A 7-year-old boy came to our Emergency Department with 7 days of abdominal pain and fever. MIS-C was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical, laboratory and instrumental tests. On admission, ECG showed type 1 Brugada pattern in the right precordial leads. During hospitalization the onset of supraventricular arrhythmias complicated the clinical picture. This case underlines management complexity of supraventricular arrhythmic events, different from atrial fibrillation, in patients with Brugada pattern in the context of a systemic inflammatory condition with significant cardiac involvement. All potential therapeutic choices should be considered to ensure the best outcomes.\nDocument [13]: Title: Distinguishing Features of Patients Evaluated for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. Abstract: Given the significant overlap of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with other common childhood illnesses presenting to the emergency department, extensive workup of this syndrome has become necessary. Nevertheless, little has been published on the factors differentiating MIS-C from other conditions in the acute care setting. We investigated differences in presentation and laboratory studies between suspected versus confirmed MIS-C patients.\nDocument [14]: Title: Coronary artery ectasia in a child after arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries and suspected multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19: a case report. Abstract: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with features resembling Kawasaki disease has been reported in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nDocument [15]: Title: The rising appendicitis mimicker: A case report of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children presenting with acute abdomen. Abstract: We describe a case of post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The 12-year-old child presented with appendicitis-like symptoms in the form of gradually worsening abdominal pain localizing over the right iliac fossa, fever, and vomiting. After an appendectomy, the abdominal pain did not resolve. He later developed orthopnea, bilateral lower limb pitting edema, and bilateral fine basal crepitations. This pointed to MIS-C. We should be mindful of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in children with a recent history of COVID-19.\nDocument [16]: Title: Best Practice Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Management of Children With Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated With SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS; Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, MIS-C) in Switzerland. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Following the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic a new disease entity emerged, defined as Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS), or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). In the absence of trials, evidence for treatment remains scarce. <b>Purpose:</b> To develop best practice recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of children with PIMS-TS in Switzerland. It is acknowledged that the field is changing rapidly, and regular revisions in the coming months are pre-planned as evidence is increasing. <b>Methods:</b> Consensus guidelines for best practice were established by a multidisciplinary group of Swiss pediatric clinicians with expertise in intensive care, immunology/rheumatology, infectious diseases, hematology, and cardiology. Subsequent to literature review, four working groups established draft recommendations which were subsequently adapted in a modified Delphi process. Recommendations had to reach &gt;80% agreement for acceptance. <b>Results:</b> The group achieved agreement on 26 recommendations, which specify diagnostic approaches and interventions across anti-inflammatory, anti-infectious, and support therapies, and follow-up for children with suspected PIMS-TS. A management algorithm was derived to guide treatment depending on the phenotype of presentation, categorized into PIMS-TS with (a) shock, (b) Kawasaki-disease like, and (c) undifferentiated inflammatory presentation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Available literature on PIMS-TS is limited to retrospective or prospective observational studies. Informed by these cohort studies and indirect evidence from other inflammatory conditions in children and adults, as well as guidelines from international health authorities, the Swiss PIMS-TS recommendations represent best practice guidelines based on currently available knowledge to standardize treatment of children with suspected PIMS-TS. Given the absence of high-grade evidence, regular updates of the recommendations will be warranted, and participation of patients in trials should be encouraged.\nDocument [17]: Title: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. An emerging clinical challenge for pediatric surgeons in the COVID 19 era. Abstract: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a potentially life-threatening condition occurring 2-6 weeks after Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in previously healthy children and adolescents, characterized by clinical and laboratory evidence of multiorgan inflammation. We reported the case of a 6-year-old child presented with acute abdomen and then diagnosed with MIS-C. In addition, to better portray this new entity, we performed a systematic review of MIS-C gastrointestinal features and particularly on those mimicking surgical emergencies.\nDocument [18]: Title: MULTISYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME IN A CHILD ASSOCIATED WITH CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON: FATAL OUTCOME IN AN INFANT. Abstract: Recently, there have been reports of children with severe inflammatory syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction associated with elevated inflammatory markers. These cases are reported as presenting the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. In this study, we describe with parental permission a case of MIS-C in an infant with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\nDocument [19]: Title: Kawasaki Disease like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Toddler during SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Nepal. Abstract: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a new childhood inflammatory disorder associated with respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This illness of elevated inflammatory markers and multiple organ involvement similar to Kawasaki disease is not commonly reported from Asia. A 17-month-old boy presented with acute onset fever, rash, non-exudative conjunctivitis and swellings of hands and legs. In x-ray chest there was infiltration on the right lower lobe and echocardiography showed evidence of coronary arteritis. The diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was confirmed on the basis of characteristic clinical features and laboratory parameters fulfilling standard case definition for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The child responded to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and high dose aspirin. Hence, amidst SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children should be suspected and effectively treated even in a country like Nepal. Keywords: Kawasaki disease; multiple inflammatory syndrome in children; Nepal; respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nDocument [20]: Title: Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome related to COVID-19, with latent tuberculosis in bone marrow, and satisfactory response to tocilizumab, in a 7-year-old boy. Abstract: Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a new acute-onset systemic inflammatory disease, which mainly affects children. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is characterized by the presence of immune sensitization to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in the absence of any clinical or radiological evidence of active disease. We present a child with MIS-C related to COVID-19, with latent TB in the bone marrow, and satisfactory response to tocilizumab. It is important to pay attention in the investigation of TB cases in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, especially when opting for immunusuppression.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Optometrists in Australia employ ophthalmic medicines in their paediatric practice to assist clinical diagnosis and to treat ocular conditions. Prior to employing ocular medicines or initiating treatment, it is important to consider the risks versus benefits of ophthalmic medicines and determine the minimum dose required to safely achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic benefit. Instilling drops in infants and young children may require techniques that do not depend on full cooperation, particularly to maintain appropriate dosing and limit the rate of elimination from the eye. Diagnostic cycloplegic agents are highly recommended for the accurate determination of refractive error in infants and young children. Topical atropine is commonly prescribed in paediatric optometry practice in highly variable concentrations. 1% atropine eye drops are used for pharmacological penalisation in management of amblyopia, and, increasingly, low concentration (< 0.1%) atropine is used to manage the progression of childhood myopia. Doses of topical ocular medicines to treat inflammation, infection or glaucoma are generally identical to those use in adults; however, there is potential for increased ocular and systemic side effects with certain medications. It is, therefore, timely to present, summarise and comment on the use of ophthalmic diagnostic and therapeutic agents in children and reference where practitioners can look for more detailed information. The perspective is set in the Australian context of a collaborative approach between paediatric optometry and ophthalmology eye care practitioners for delivery of best practice care in infants and young children. Inclusion of the more complex spectrum of paediatric eye disease in a tertiary ophthalmological setting is provided to build practitioner knowledge of treatment regimens their patients may be using, even though management of these conditions lies outside their scope of practice.\nDocument [2]: Title: Topical ophthalmic atropine in horses, pharmacokinetics and effect on intestinal motility. Abstract: Topical ophthalmic atropine sulfate is an important part of the treatment protocol in equine uveitis. Frequent administration of topical atropine may cause decreased intestinal motility and colic in horses due to systemic exposure. Atropine pharmacokinetics are unknown in horses and this knowledge gap could impede the use of atropine because of the presumed risk of unwanted effects. Additional information could therefore increase safety in atropine treatment.\nDocument [3]: Title: Evaluation of atropine 1% ophthalmic solution administered sublingually for the management of terminal respiratory secretions. Abstract: Terminal respiratory secretions (TRS) or \"death rattle\" is a common symptom in the dying patient. Current practice for the prevention and treatment of TRS involves the use of oral, sublingual, transdermal, or parenteral anticholinergic medications. A retrospective chart review of patients admitted to a hospice inpatient unit for terminal care and treated with sublingual atropine 1% ophthalmic drops for TRS was conducted. A total of 19 of 22 patients treated with atropine had documented reduction or resolution of TRS. This study suggests that atropine 1% ophthalmic drops administered sublingually are a reasonable option for the management of TRS. Problematic cardiac or central nervous system symptoms were not found in the present study. Results should aid hospice programs who are seeking guidance on the management of TRS with atropine 1% ophthalmic drops.\nDocument [4]: Title: Objective evaluation of the systemic effects of topical application of 1% atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution in healthy horses. Abstract: OBJECTIVE To determine the safety of topical administration of 1% atropine ophthalmic solution in healthy horses by objectively measuring gastrointestinal transit time. DESIGN Randomized, masked, controlled crossover study. ANIMALS 6 adult geldings. PROCEDURES Horses were randomly assigned (3/group) to first receive topical treatment of the left eye with 1% atropine or artificial tears solution; the right eye was left untreated. After 24 hours of treatment every 6 hours, 200 nontoxic beads were administered to each horse via nasogastric intubation and treatment frequency was decreased to every 12 hours for 4 more days. Pupillary light reflexes (PLRs), mydriasis, heart rate, fecal bead passage, abdominal girth measurements, auscultable gut sounds, fecal weight, and clinical signs of abdominal pain were monitored. Following a 4-week washout period, horses received the opposite treatment in the left eye and measurements were repeated. Serum atropine concentration (reflecting systemic absorption) was measured with an ELISA at various points after initial atropine administration. RESULTS No horse had subjective or objective evidence of colic or ileus at any monitoring point. Complete mydriasis of the left eye with absence of the PLR was identified in 5 horses within 6 hours and in all 6 horses within 12 hours after initial atropine administration. One horse had mydriasis with an absent PLR in the untreated eye by day 5 of atropine treatment. At no point was atropine detected in serum samples of any horse. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Topical atropine application at clinically appropriate doses induced no evidence of ileus in healthy horses.\nDocument [5]: Title: Stability of Ophthalmic Atropine Solutions for Child Myopia Control. Abstract: Myopia is an ophthalmic condition affecting more than 1/5th of the world population, especially children. Low-dose atropine eyedrops have been shown to limit myopia evolution during treatment. However, there are currently no commercial industrial forms available and there is little data published concerning the stability of medications prepared by compounding pharmacies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of two 0.1 mg/mL atropine formulations (with and without antimicrobiobial preservatives) for 6 months in two different low-density polyethylene (LDPE) multidose eyedroppers. Analyses used were the following: visual inspection, turbidity, chromaticity measurements, osmolality and pH measurements, atropine quantification by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, breakdown product research, and sterility assay. In an in-use study, atropine quantification was also performed on the drops emitted from the multidose eyedroppers. All tested parameters remained stable during the 6 months period, with atropine concentrations above 94.7% of initial concentration. A breakdown product (tropic acid) did increase slowly over time but remained well below usually admitted concentrations. Atropine concentrations remained stable during the in-use study. Both formulations of 0.1 mg/mL of atropine (with and without antimicrobial preservative) were proved to be physicochemically stable for 6 months at 25 \u00b0C when stored in LDPE bottles, with an identical microbial shelf-life.\nDocument [6]: Title: The effect of topical ophthalmic 1% atropine on heart rate and rhythm in normal dogs.

Abstract: It is essential to elucidate drug distribution in the ocular tissues and drug transit in the eye for ophthalmic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Atropine is a reversible muscarinic receptor used to treat various diseases. However, its distribution in ocular tissues is still incompletely understood. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) evaluates drug distribution in biological samples. However, there have been few investigations of drug distribution in ocular tissues, including whole-eye segments. In the present study, we explored the spatial distribution of atropine in the whole-eye segment by MALDI-IMS, and then evaluated the changes in atropine level along the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior axes. A 1% atropine solution was administered to a rabbit and after 30 min, its eye was enucleated, sectioned, and analyzed by MALDI-IMS. Atropine accumulated primarily in the tear menisci but was found at substantially lower concentrations in the tissue surrounding the conjunctival sacs. Relative differences in atropine levels between the anterior and posterior regions provided insights into the post-instillation behavior of atropine. Atropine signal intensities differed among corneal layers and between the superior and inferior eyeball regions. Differences in signal intensity among tissues indicated that the drug migrated to the posterior regions via a periocular-scleral route. Line scan analysis elucidated atropine transit from the anterior to the posterior region. This information is useful for atropine delivery in the ocular tissues and indicates that MALDI-IMS is effective for revealing drug distribution in whole-eye sections.\nDocument [8]: Title: Validation of a preclinical dry eye model in New Zealand white rabbits during and following topical instillation of 1% ophthalmic atropine sulfate.

Abstract: We determine the efficacy of parenteral ophthalmic antimuscarinic agents (tropicamide ophthalmic 1% and cyclopentolate hydrochloride ophthalmic 1%) on survivability in a rat model of acute, lethal organophosphate pesticide (OP) poisoning. After obtaining an appropriate dose-response for study comparison, rodents were randomized to receive 1 of 4 intraperitoneal antidotes; (1) 0.3 mL normal saline, (2) atropine 10 mg/kg, (3) ophthalmic tropicamide 20 mg/kg, or (4) ophthalmic cyclopentolate 20 mg/kg. Five minutes after pretreatment, 15 mg/kg of dichlorvos was administered subcutaneously. Mortality rates and time to death were compared using Fisher exact test and the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test, respectively. If alive at 120 minutes, survival was assumed and the study was terminated. Survival in rats pretreated with atropine (10 mg/kg) was 90%. Survival in rats pretreated with tropicamide (20 mg/kg) and cyclopentolate (20 mg/kg) were 90% [P < 0.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.09] and 90% (P < 0.01; 95% CI 0.71-1.09), respectively, compared with controls (10% survival; 95% CI 0.04-0.45). Time of death ranged between 6 and 13 minutes in nonsurvivors. Overall comparison of survival time revealed a statistically significant improvement in experimental groups compared with controls (P < 0.0001). Pretreatment with parenteral ophthalmic solutions (tropicamide or cyclopentolate) was equivalent to standard atropine in preventing lethality in this rat model of acute, lethal OP poisoning.\nDocument [10]: Title: Changes in intraocular pressure and horizontal pupil diameter during use of topical mydriatics in the canine eye. Abstract: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of topical 0.5% tropicamide, 1% atropine sulphate and 10% phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions on intraocular pressure (IOP) and horizontal pupil diameter (HPD) in the dog during the first hour after treatment. Forty clinically and ophthalmologically normal canine patients (between the ages of 2 and 6 years) of varying breed and sex were used in this study. Animals were randomly divided into four groups of ten and given one drop of tropicamide, atropine, phenylephrine or saline into one eye. IOP and HPD were measured in both eyes every 5 minutes for 60 minutes. Tropicamide increased IOP by 8.8\u00b14.0 mmHg 35 minutes post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (P<0.01) only in treated eye. IOP in the contralateral eye did not increase. With atropine the maximum increase in IOP was 2.6\u00b12.8 mmHg at 20 minutes post treatment in the treated eye (P<0.01). IOP in the contralateral eye did not increase. Phenylephrine increased IOP by 2.3\u00b12.1 mmHg (P<0.05) 10 minutes after treatment. Also in the untreated eye IOP increased by 2.3\u00b12.1 mmHg, 20 minutes post-treatment. Maximum HPD in eyes treated with tropicamide occurred at 55 minutes and with atropine at 60 minutes. There were no HPD changes in the contralateral, untreated eye. Topical 10% phenylephrine showed maximal pupil dilation 60 minutes after treatment, but the HPD of the - untreated eye slightly decreased at 15 minutes, but this change only reached statistical significance at 40 min post- treatment (P<0.05). Normal saline showed no influence on IOP or HPD. The drugs investigated here show a significant increase in IOP after mydriatics.\nDocument [11]: Title: Atropine-eluting silicone contact lenses for myopia control. Abstract: Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is one of the prime reasons for vision impairment worldwide. Atropine in topical ophthalmic solutions (e.g., 0.01% atropine sulfate eye drops) is the primary medical treatment for controlling myopia, especially for pseudomyopia or true myopia in rapid progress. However, aqueous atropine solution is unstable and easily breaks down to tropic acid, which will result in vision blur. Drug-eluting contact lenses (CLs) have been explored as a potentially superior alternative to effectively control the drug release and improve the drug efficacy. In this work, an atropine-eluting contact lens was developed by encapsulating an atropine implant in a silicon-based contact lens, towards functioning in vision correction and controlling myopia. The safety and effectiveness of this atropine-eluting contact lens were verified with rabbit and guinea pig models. The results showed that the lenses reduced the side effects like mydriasis and no other adverse events were observed in rabbit eyes. More importantly, atropine-loaded lenses could effectively delay the progress of form-deprivation myopia with guinea pig eyes as the model. Thus, we concluded that atropine-eluting CLs prepared by implantation technology may be an option for the treatment of myopia.\nDocument [12]: Title: Intramuscular ophthalmic homatropine vs. atropine to prevent lethality in rates with dichlorvos poisoning. Abstract: Most hospitals lack a sufficient supply of atropine to treat, simultaneously, patients poisoned with multiple organophosphorous compound (OC) or nerve agent. The presence of a ubiquitous alternate antidote would prove useful if mass poisoning occurred. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of ophthalmic homatropine (Isopto Homatropine 5%) on survivability in a rat model of significant, acute OC poisoning.\nDocument [13]: Title: Atropine Eye Drops Inappropriately Used for Diplopia Following Cosmetic Botulinum A Toxin Injections.

Abstract: Sialorrhea is a troublesome and disabling symptom defined by the unintentional loss of saliva from the mouth, usually associated with swallowing disorders. Today there is no consensus about the management of sialorrhoea, but off-label use of ophthalmic atropine eyedrop administered sublingually may offer benefits, despite limited safety data. We report 2 cases of atropine overdose after sublingual administration illustrating that atropine can expose to severe adverse effects when administered sublingually. The noncompartmental pharmacokinetic study of atropine performed in 1 patient highlighted that systemic absorption of sublingual atropine was effective (C<sub>max</sub> [1 h] = 2.2 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> ; approximately) after a single dose of 1 mg.\nDocument [16]: Title: Treatment of canine postoperative ocular hypertension with combined latanoprost 0.005% and atropine 1% ophthalmic solutions.

Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Phenylephrine and atropine can cause serious adverse effects when applied in combination. We investigated the effect of phenylephrine eye drops combined with intravenous atropine on the cardiovascular system in patients under general anesthesia undergoing intraocular surgery. <b>Methods:</b> The effects of the drugs were observed through clinical study. Thirteen patients undergoing intraocular surgery under general anesthesia were observed in this study; all were injected intravenously with atropine due to the oculocardiac reflex during surgery. To study the combination of drugs, an <i>in vivo</i> study was performed on rats. Seventy-two standard deviation rats that received phenylephrine eye drops and intravenous atropine treatment under general anesthesia were assessed, of which 18 treated with these drugs simultaneously were administered normal saline, neostigmine or esmolol. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded and analyzed. <b>Findings:</b> The age of the patients ranged from seven to 14&#160;years old with an average age of 10.7&#160;years old, and 11 patients were male. In patients, 5% phenylephrine eye drops combined with intravenous atropine led to a significant heart rate increase and the increase lasted 20&#160;min. The significant increase in diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure lasted for 15 and 25&#160;min, respectively. From five to 25&#160;min after intravenous atropine treatment, the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were both more than 20% higher than that at baseline. In rats, the changes in blood pressure and heart rate were independent of the phenylephrine and atropine administration sequence but were related to the administration time interval. The neostigmine group showed a significant decrease in blood pressure after the increase from the administration of phenylephrine and atropine. <b>Interpretation:</b> Phenylephrine eye drops combined with intravenous atropine have obvious cardiovascular effects that can be reversed by neostigmine. This drug combination should be used carefully for ophthalmic surgery, especially in patients with cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: We report the case of a 59-year-old patient who accidentally underwent live vaccination against yellow fever during continuous treatment with the TNF-\u03b1-antibody (AB) infliximab for ulcerative colitis. The clinical course showed fever of short duration and elevation of liver enzymes without further clinical complications. Yellow fever viremia was not detectable and protective antibodies were developed. A primary vaccination against yellow fever under infliximab has not been reported in the literature before, although vaccination is an important topic in IBD. Live vaccinations, like Stamaril(\u00ae) against yellow fever, are contraindicated during TNF-\u03b1-AB treatment. Treatment regimens containing TNF-\u03b1-AB are of growing importance, not only in gastroenterology, but also in rheumatology and dermatology. We discuss this topic by presenting our case and reviewing the current literature.\nDocument [2]: Title: What a rheumatologist needs to know about yellow fever vaccine. Abstract: Patients with rheumatic diseases are more susceptible to infection, due to the underlying disease itself or to its treatment. The rheumatologist should prevent infections in those patients, vaccination being one preventive measure to be adopted. Yellow fever is one of such infectious diseases that can be avoided.The yellow fever vaccine is safe and effective for the general population, but, being an attenuated live virus vaccine, it should be avoided whenever possible in rheumatic patients on immunosuppressive drugs. Considering that yellow fever is endemic in a large area of Brazil, and that vaccination against that disease is indicated for those living in such area or travelling there, rheumatologists need to know that disease, as well as the indications for the yellow fever vaccine and contraindications to it. Our paper was aimed at highlighting the major aspects rheumatologists need to know about the yellow fever vaccine to decide about its indication or contraindication in specific situations.\nDocument [3]: Title: A case of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease in Ecuador. Abstract: We report the first case of viscerotropic syndrome in Ecuador. Because of similarities between yellow fever and viscerotropic syndrome, the incidence of this recently described complication of vaccination with the 17D yellow fever vaccine is not known. There is a large population in South America that is considered at risk for possible reemergence of urban yellow fever. Knowledge of potentially fatal complications of yellow fever vaccine should temper decisions to vaccinate populations where the disease is not endemic.\nDocument [4]: Title: [Control discourses and power relations of yellow fever: Philadelphia in 1793]. Abstract: 1793 Yellow fever in Philadelphia was the most severe epidemics in the late 18th century in the United States. More than 10% of the population in the city died and many people fled to other cities. The cause of yellow fever in the United States had close relationship with slaves and sugar in Philadelphia. Sugarcane plantation had needed many labors to produce sugar and lots of Africans had to move to America as slaves. In this process, A\u00ebdes aegypti, the vector of yellow fever had migrated to America and the circumstances of ships or cities provided appropriate conditions for its breeding. In this period, the cause of yellow fever could not be established exactly, so suggestions of doctors became entangled in political and intellectual discourses in American society. There was a critical conflict between Jeffersonian Republicanism and Federalism about the origin and treatment of yellow fever. Benjamin Rush, a Jeffersonian Republican, suggested urban sanitation reform and bloodletting. He believed the infectious disease happened because of unsanitary city condition, so he thought the United States could be a healthy nation by improvement of the public health and sanitation. He would like to cope with national crisis and develop American society on the basis of republicanism. While Rush suggested the improvement of public health and sanitation, the city government of Philadelphia suggested isolation of yellow fever patients and quarantine. City government isolated the patients from healthy people and it reconstructed space of hospital. Also, it built orphanages to take care of children who lost their parents during the epidemic and implemented power to control people put in the state of exception. Of course, city government tried to protect the city and nation by quarantine of every ship to Philadelphia. Control policies of yellow fever in 1793 showed different conflicts and interactions. Through the yellow fever, Jeffersonian Republicanism and Federalism had conflicted in politically, but they had interactions for control of the infectious disease. And with these kinds of infectious diseases policies, we can see interactions in local, national and global level.\nDocument [5]: Title: Yellow Fever in an Unvaccinated Traveler to Peru. Abstract: We present a case of an unvaccinated traveler who traveled from New York to Peru and contracted yellow fever.

Our case illustrates the dramatic course that yellow fever may take, as well as the importance of pretravel vaccination.\nDocument [6]: Title: Acute viscerotropic disease following vaccination against yellow fever. Abstract: Acute viscerotropic disease following yellow fever vaccination (YEL-AVD) is a rare but serious complication of vaccination with 17D yellow fever vaccine. This paper reviews the existing literature regarding YEL-AVD and discusses possible etiologic mechanisms. A greater understanding of this condition is essential to assuring safe and effective prevention of yellow fever and vaccination against other arboviral diseases for which 17D-based vaccines are being developed.\nDocument [7]: Title: Yellow Fever Outbreak - Kongo Central Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, August 2016. Abstract: On April 23, 2016, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Ministry of Health declared a yellow fever outbreak. As of May 24, 2016, approximately 90% of suspected yellow fever cases (n = 459) and deaths (45) were reported in a single province, Kongo Central Province, that borders Angola, where a large yellow fever outbreak had begun in December 2015. Two yellow fever mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in Kongo Central Province during May 25-June 7, 2016 and August 17-28, 2016. In June 2016, the DRC Ministry of Health requested assistance from CDC to control the outbreak. As of August 18, 2016, a total of 410 suspected yellow fever cases and 42 deaths were reported in Kongo Central Province. Thirty seven of the 393 specimens tested in the laboratory were confirmed as positive for yellow fever virus (local outbreak threshold is one laboratory-confirmed case of yellow fever). Although not well-documented for this outbreak, malaria, viral hepatitis, and typhoid fever are common differential diagnoses among suspected yellow fever cases in this region. Other possible diagnoses include Zika, West Nile, or dengue viruses; however, no laboratory-confirmed cases of these viruses were reported. Thirty five of the 37 cases of yellow fever were imported from Angola. Two-thirds of confirmed cases occurred in persons who crossed the DRC-Angola border at one market city on the DRC side, where \u226440,000 travelers cross the border each week on market day. Strategies to improve coordination between health surveillance and cross-border trade activities at land borders and to enhance laboratory and case-based surveillance and health border screening capacity are needed to prevent and control future yellow fever outbreaks.\nDocument [8]: Title: Sustained circulation of yellow fever virus in Cameroon: an analysis of laboratory surveillance data, 2010-2020. Abstract: The re-emergence of yellow fever poses a serious public health risk to unimmunized communities in the tropical regions of Africa and South America and unvaccinated travelers visiting these regions. This risk is further accentuated by the likely spread of the virus to areas with potential for yellow fever transmission such as in Asia, Europe, and North America. To mitigate this risk, surveillance of yellow fever is pivotal. We performed an analysis of laboratory-based surveillance of yellow fever suspected cases in Cameroon during 2010-2020 to characterize the epidemiology of yellow fever cases and define health districts at high risk.\nDocument [9]: Title: Fatal multiorgan failure due to yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease. Abstract: Yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) is a rare complication of yellow fever (YF) vaccination. A previously healthy 22-year-old female died following YF vaccination despite aggressive measures. Serial viral load titers, cytokine levels and host genetic factors were evaluated in an attempt to understand this unusual and lethal outcome. The patient's high-titer vaccine viremia and possibly related minor genetic anomalies provide clues to exploring the etiology of YEL-AVD.\nDocument [10]: Title: Yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease. Abstract: Yellow fever is a mosquito-transmitted hemorrhagic viral disease that is endemic to tropical regions in South America and Africa. It remains a significant health concern for deploying military personnel, accordingly vaccination is frequently performed on troops. Although the vaccine is generally administered with only minor complications, rare severe complications are also reported. Herein, we report a mild case of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease 4 days after administration of the vaccine. The various complications of the vaccine and their pathogenesis are also reviewed.\nDocument [11]: Title: [Contagiousness of yellow fever in the Netherlands between 1820 and 1825. Medical and sanitary aspects of a polymorphic disease]. Abstract: Shortly after 1800, the question of the contagiousness of yellow fever was quite a topic. In the Netherlands, as was the case in France, the government feared the introduction of contagious diseases, especially of the yellow fever. This growing fear was prompted by the increasing number of yellow fever appearances in the mediterranean ports of France, Spain and Italy, as well as in some French Atlantic ports. In 1821, Thomassen ai Thuessink (a leading expert on epidemic diseases in the Netherlands), Bernard and Van Stipriaan Lu\u00efscius were invited by the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences, Literature and Arts (Amsterdam) to assess two treatises on yellow fever, written by Jean Devkze. Devhze's treatises were meticulously analysed. After careful considerations they took the side of Devhze's opponents, and so was the character of their advice to the Dutch government. As a result, already existing sanitary laws were maintained and were even laid down more strictly. Not until several decades later, the senselessness of the distinction between infectious and contagious (as being used by early nineteenth-century scientists) would be generally admitted, although the earliest rumours were already heard shortly after 1800.\nDocument [12]: Title: Yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease, a suspicious case. Abstract: A 70-year-old man with known cardiovascular risk factors, presented with acute onset expression aphasia, agraphia, dyscalculia, right-left disorientation and finger agnosia, without fever or meningeal signs. Stroke was thought to be the cause, but cerebrovascular disease investigation was negative. Interviewing the family revealed he had undergone yellow fever vaccination 18&#8197;days before. Lumbar puncture revealed mild protein elevation. Cultural examinations, <i>Coxiella burnetti,</i> and neurotropic virus serologies were negative. Regarding the yellow fever virus, IgG was identified in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with negative IgM and virus PCR in CSF. EEG showed an encephalopathic pattern. The patient improved gradually and a week after discharge was his usual self. Only criteria for suspect neurotropic disease were met, but it's possible the time spent between symptom onset and lumbar puncture prevented a definite diagnosis of yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease. This gap would have been smaller if the vaccination history had been collected earlier.\nDocument [13]: Title: Lewis W. Hackett and the early years of the International Health Board's Yellow Fever Program in Brazil, 1917-1924. Abstract: Lewis W. Hackett joined the staff of the International Health Board (IHB) in 1914. He was sent to Brazil in 1916, where his original responsibility was hookworm control, but he was gradually and inevitably drawn into combating other diseases. Hackett had a strong influence on public health in Brazil. In 1922 he instituted grass-roots (local) health units and programs. The next year, he negotiated with the federal government a cooperative yellow fever control program, which was described in the IHB's 1923 annual report as the \"new and final campaign against yellow fever\" in Brazil. Eleven offices were established in northern Brazil, where it was expected that yellow fever would quickly be eradicated. Just as the new program got underway Hackett was reassigned to Italy, where he remained until the beginning of World War II. Nonetheless, Hackett had done a classic job of developing the IHB program in Brazil, moving carefully but authoritatively from the initial focus on hookworm, to the development of a more comprehensive public health program, and then to the strategic thrust toward yellow fever.\nDocument [14]: Title: Case Report: Yellow Fever Vaccine-Associated Neurotropic Disease and Associated MRI, EEG, and CSF Findings. Abstract: Yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (YEL-AND) is a rare and serious complication following vaccination with the 17D live attenuated yellow fever vaccine. Cases of YEL-AND have presented as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and meningoencephalitis. To date, intracranial imaging of the progression and resolution of this disease has been minimally depicted in the literature. We present the case of a 67-year-old woman who developed YEL-AND following vaccination. Her diagnosis was complicated by imaging findings consistent with variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease. Her clinical history and the progression of her intracranial imaging is discussed in this case report.\nDocument [15]: Title: Yellow fever vaccination centers: concurrent vaccinations and updates on mosquito biology. Abstract: Mandatory visits to immunization centers that offer pre-travel Yellow fever vaccine to prospective travelers would be useful for briefing the basics of the biology of the mosquito responsible for Yellow fever spread. Pre- travel knowledge on the day-time rather the nocturnal biting habit of the mosquitoes of Aedes species would prevent from bites of the mosquitoes responsible for the spread of viruses causing Yellow fever, dengue or Chikungunya infection.\nDocument [16]: Title: Viscerotropic disease and acute uveitis following yellow fever vaccination: a case report. Abstract: Yellow fever vaccine exists for over 80 years and is considered to be relatively safe. However, in rare cases it can produce serious neurotropic and viscerotropic complications. We report a case of a patient who presented both viscerotropic and neurological manifestations after yellow fever vaccination.\nDocument [17]: Title: Serious adverse event: late neurotropic disease associated with yellow fever vaccine. Abstract: The yellow fever is a systemic disease that was under control due to the effective campaigns against the vector and promotion of vaccines programs. However, since 1999, outbreaks appeared because of inefficient control of the vector, and led to the need of amplifying the immunization in large scale against the yellow fever virus, and consequently, raising the risk of adverse reactions to the vaccine. We report a case of previously healthy infant, who was referred to our care service, after 3 days with fever, chills, nausea and vomits, he received support therapy and was discharged from the hospital. After 24 hours of supportive measures, he was discharge. The patient returned to our service with general condition decline, strabismus, inability to control of cervical musculature and reduced force of the legs. The patient vaccine had received all vaccines from the calendar, and he was vaccinated for yellow fever 20 days before symptoms. During the hospitalization, liquor was collected, and ceftriaxone and aciclovir were administered. After negative cultures from the liquor, the antibiotics were suspended. The computed tomography of patient's brain showed no alterations. Research for antibodies against yellow fever was requested, being positive for IgM in the liquor, and confirming the neurotropic disease associated with the yellow fever vaccine. On the fifth day of hospitalization, the patient showed improvement on the strabismus, cervical tonus, and musculature force. On the tenth day of hospitalization, patient showed complete improvement, and his laboratory exams no alterations. Subsequently, patient was discharged. The vaccine against yellow fever is safe, efficient and highly recommended, however it is not completely free from serious adverse reactions, including death.\nDocument [18]: Title: Review of data and knowledge gaps regarding yellow fever vaccine-induced immunity and duration of protection. Abstract: Yellow fever (YF) virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus found in Sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. The virus causes YF, a viral hemorrhagic fever, which can be prevented by a live-attenuated vaccine, strain 17D. Despite the vaccine being very successful at decreasing disease risk, YF is considered a re-emerging disease due to the increased numbers of cases in the last 30 years. Until 2014, the vaccine was recommended to be administered with boosters every 10 years, but in 2014 the World Health Organization recommended removal of booster doses for all except special populations. This recommendation has been questioned and there have been reports of waning antibody titers in adults over time and more recently in pediatric populations. Clearly, the potential of waning antibody titers is a very important issue that needs to be carefully evaluated. In this Perspective, we review what is known about the correlate of protection for full-dose YF vaccine, current information on waning antibody titers, and gaps in knowledge. Overall, fundamental questions exist on the durability of protective immunity induced by YF vaccine, but interpretation of studies is complicated by the use of different assays and different cut-offs to measure seroprotective immunity, and differing results among certain endemic versus non-endemic populations. Notwithstanding the above, there are few well-characterized reports of vaccine failures, which one would expect to observe potentially more with the re-emergence of a severe disease. Overall, there is a need to improve YF disease surveillance, increase primary vaccination coverage rates in at-risk populations, and expand our understanding of the mechanism of protection of YF vaccine.\nDocument [19]: Title: Ensuring the Safety of Yellow Fever Vaccination in Travelers-The Experience at a Large U.S. Academic Medical Center in Colorado. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Yellow fever (YF) virus has the potential to cause fatal outcomes among at-risk individuals visiting endemic areas. Vaccinating travelers who are at risk is necessary to prevent virus-related life-threatening complications. We lack data on the clinical features of persons seeking YF vaccination. We aim to describe the characteristics of a cohort of persons receiving the YF vaccine before travel. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of 964 travelers receiving the YF vaccine (Stamaril<sup>&#174;</sup>) from Oct 2016 to Jul 2019 was performed at the University of Colorado Hospital, U.S. Percentages, means, and standard deviations were calculated. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to evaluate the association between receiving YF vaccination less than 10 days before departure and visiting friends and relatives (VFR). <b>Results:</b> The average age of the subjects was 39 &#177; 18 years with a range of nine months to 83 years. Persons who were 60 years of age and older represented 17%. Women consisted of 52%, and most of the travelers were Caucasians (64%). Travelers reported traveling to Africa (57%) or South America (40%). The primary destinations for travelers overall were Kenya (19%), Uganda (11%), and Tanzania (11%) in Africa; and Peru (14%) and Brazil (13%) in South America. The most common reasons for travel included leisure (44%), VFR (18%), and mission trips (10%). Comorbidities included a history of hematologic disorders (4%), HIV infection (2%), and diabetes mellitus (3%). The average duration between vaccine administration and travel was 43 days. Those VFR were two times more likely to receive the YF vaccination &lt;10 days before departure. <b>Conclusions:</b> Identifying the type of travel, itinerary, and underlying medical conditions allows providers to administer the YF vaccine to travelers safely. There is a need to identify strategies to improve the timing of YF vaccination among VFR travelers.\nDocument [20]: Title: Multi-epitope based vaccine against yellow fever virus applying immunoinformatics approaches. Abstract: Yellow fever disease is considered a re-emerging major health issue which has caused recent outbreaks with a high number of deaths. Tropical countries, mainly African and South American, are the most affected by Yellow fever outbreaks. Despite the availability of an attenuated vaccine, its use is limited for some groups such as pregnant and nursing women, immunocompromised and immunosuppressed patients, elderly people >65 years, infants <6 months and patients with biological disorders like thymus disorders. In order to achieve new preventive measures, we applied immunoinformatics approaches to develop a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine for Yellow fever virus. Different epitopes, related to humoral and cell-mediated immunity, were predicted for complete polyproteins of two Yellow fever strains (Asibi and 17 D vaccine). Those epitopes common for both strains were mapped into a set of 137 sequences of Yellow fever virus, including 77 sequences from a recent outbreak at the state of Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil. Therefore, the present work uses robust bioinformatics approaches for the identification of a multi-epitope vaccine against the Yellow fever virus. Our results indicate that the identified multi-epitope vaccine might stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses and could be a potential vaccine candidate against Yellow fever virus infection. Hence, it should be subjected to further experimental validations. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Substantial evidence implicates mitochondria dysfunction in brain and skeletal muscle in the pathogenesis of HD. Metabolic strategies, such as fasting and ketogenic diets, theoretically enhance brain and muscle metabolism and mitochondria function, which may improve the clinical symptoms of HD. We report the case of a 41-year-old man with progressive, deteriorating HD who pursued a time-restricted ketogenic diet (TRKD) for 48 weeks. Improvements were measured in his motor symptoms (52% improvement from baseline), activities of daily living (28% improvement), composite Unified HD Rating Scale (cUHDRS) score (20% improvement), HD-related behavior problems (apathy, disorientation, anger, and irritability improved by 50-100%), and mood-related quality of life (25% improvement). Cognition did not improve. Weight remained stable and there were no significant adverse effects. This case study is unique in that a patient with progressive, deteriorating HD was managed with a TRKD, with subsequent improvements in his motor symptoms, activities of daily living, cUHDRS score, most major HD-related behavior problems, and quality of life. Our patient remains dedicated to his TRKD, which continues to provide benefit for him and his family.\nDocument [2]: Title: The Patient Education Program for Huntington's Disease (PEP-HD). Abstract: The goal of the Patient Education Program for Huntington's disease is to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers, to educate and train them in order to develop coping strategies to deal with psychosocial stressors. The program was derived from a standardized evidence-based program for Parkinson's disease. This pilot study assessed the feasibility of the program in Huntington's disease. Forty manifest patients with 28 caregivers and 19 premanifest carriers with 14 partners participated. Assessments for depression and anxiety, psychosocial burden, need for help, quality of life, coping, behavioral, motor and cognitive status were performed. After program completion, significant improvement of behavioral symptoms and anxiety was found for manifest HD patients, and they used a less passive coping style and more social support. Their caregivers reported less psychosocial burden. Premanifest carriers and their partners improved their coping by seeking social support more often. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of the program in Huntington's disease, especially in the manifest stage of the disease. Further research to assess the effectiveness of the program seems warranted.\nDocument [3]: Title: An International Validation of a Clinical Tool to Assess Carers' Quality of Life in Huntington's Disease. Abstract: Family carers of individuals living with Huntington's disease (HD) manage a distinct and unique series of difficulties arising from the complex nature of HD. This paper presents the validation of the definitive measure of quality of life (QoL) for this group. The Huntington's Disease Quality of Life Battery for Carers (HDQoL-C) was expanded (<i>n</i> = 47) and then administered to an international sample of 1716 partners and family carers from 13 countries. In terms of the psychometric properties of the tool, exploratory analysis of half of the sample demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability. Some items on the full version did not meet psychometric thresholds and a short version (HDQoL-Cs) (<i>n</i> = 23) was developed based on more stringent criteria. This was achieved using standard psychometric item reduction techniques to both increase reliability and reduce the burden of carers completing the scale. Confirmatory factor analysis of the model structure showed a good fit for all factors and indicated that the HDQoL-C and HDQoL-Cs are psychometrically robust measures of QoL. We found that carers who lived with and looked after their spouse/partner had reduced sense of coping, hope for the future, and overall QoL. Carers with children who were at risk carried the gene or were symptomatic also had poorer QoL outcomes. Findings indicated the HDQoL-C and HDQoL-Cs are valid in multiple languages and across varied cultures as measures of self-reported QoL in family carers of individual's living with HD. These psychometrically validated tools can aid and guide the implementation of therapeutic interventions to improve life quality in this population and research into international and cross-cultural carer experiences. The HDQoL-Cs is recommended as the definitive international measure of HD carer QoL.\nDocument [4]: Title: Case report: Clinical lycanthropy in Huntington's disease. Abstract: We describe the case of a patient diagnosed with Huntington's disease (HD), who, following a two-year history of anxiety with obsessional preoccupations, developed psychosis with clinical lycanthropy: a prominent delusional idea that he was a werewolf. Although there was no benefit from various antidepressants and antipsychotics, there was remarkable improvement of his symptoms following prescription of Clozapine. His choreiform movement disorder also improved as his mental state settled. Although some reported cases of clinical lycanthropy are related to neurological conditions, this is the first case in a patient with HD. We also discuss the relevance of cultural and personal factors in the expression of a delusion that incorporates disgust, and the potential role of somatosensory aberrations and misidentification of self.\nDocument [5]: Title: Diagnosing Juvenile Huntington's Disease: An Explorative Study among Caregivers of Affected Children. Abstract: <i>Objective:</i> To investigate the reasons for the diagnostic delay of juvenile Huntington's disease patients in the Netherlands. <i>Methods</i>: This study uses interpretative phenomenological analysis. Eligible participants were parents and caregivers of juvenile Huntington's disease patients. <i>Results</i>: Eight parents were interviewed, who consulted up to four health care professionals. The diagnostic process lasted three to ten years. Parents believe that careful listening and follow-up would have improved the diagnostic process. Although they believe an earlier diagnosis would have benefited their child's wellbeing, they felt they would not have been able to cope with more grief at that time. <i>Conclusion</i>: The delay in diagnosis is caused by the lack of knowledge among health care professionals on the one hand, and the resistance of the parent on the other. For professionals, the advice is to personalize their advice in which a conscious doctor's delay is acceptable or even useful.\nDocument [6]: Title: Couples' coping in prodromal Huntington disease: a mixed methods study. Abstract: Huntington disease (HD) includes a prodromal phase with behavioral, cognitive, and motor function decline occurring up to 15 years prior to diagnosis. This study used mixed methods to examine how people in the prodromal phase and their companions coped with noticed changes. Twenty-three couples completed a semi-structured interview and Brief COPE. Participants with prodromal HD used acceptance, emotional support, and planning most frequently; companions used acceptance, planning, and active coping. Least frequently used coping strategies for each were denial, behavioral disengagement, and substance use. Qualitative interviews revealed coping strategies not included in the Brief COPE. Participants with prodromal HD used prescription medications, coping as a couple, hope, and self-monitoring; companions used hope and helping their partners. Many of the coping procedures were rated as effective, especially when changes were not severe. Couples may benefit from counseling that emphasizes using active coping strategies for changes that can be compensated for and acceptance for changes that cannot in prodromal HD. Findings from this study may be helpful for counseling patients and significant others facing other neurodegenerative conditions with prodromal or early phases, such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.\nDocument [7]: Title: Psychosis with Huntington's disease: role of antipsychotic medications. Abstract: This is a case of a 60-year-old man who presented with a 6-month history of increasing agitation and emotional volatility. His family brought him to the emergency room as they were concerned about his threatening and aggressive behaviour. The patient was initially incoherent and uncooperative. During the interview, the patient's family revealed that he had a previous diagnosis of Huntington's disease; there was also a family history of personality changes preceding Huntington's chorea. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric inpatient unit and started on low-dose risperidone. Consequently, there was marked improvement in his symptoms. Subsequent cognitive tests revealed deficits in multiple domains. After a month, the patient was discharged to a community home in stable state.\nDocument [8]: Title: [Which interventions are recommended in the last phase of Huntington disease?] Abstract: Huntington Disease is a chronically progressive and neurodegenerative disease, which leads to death after 10 to 30 years of suffering and worsening. When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.\nDocument [9]: Title: How do partners find out about the risk of Huntington's disease in couple relationships? Abstract: Whilst a growing body of work has explored family communication about Huntington's disease and how at-risk individuals learn about their risk, the experience of telling a partner and partners' experiences of finding out about this potentially devastating hereditary illness have received little attention. This study describes the experiences of partners in finding out about Huntington's disease and any impact on couple's relationships/marriages. We undertook a thematic analysis of qualitative interviews which explored the dynamics of partners' marriages after predictive testing and partners' views of genetic counseling. A main theme from partners' accounts was how they found out about their spouse's risk of Huntington's disease and the impact this had on marital relations. The analysis revealed four types of disclosure experiences: (1) marital secrets; (2) alerting, but not telling; (3) knowing and seeing; (4) marital ignorance. Our findings demonstrate that partners' experiences of (non)disclosure about the risk of HD within marriages is an important factor which contributes to couples' coping or marital problems. Exploring how spouses found out about their partner's risk of HD will illuminate issues about a couple's past and future patterns of communication and their coping strategies. A practical and ethical implication is the extent to which genetic counselors should inform partners about the course and nature of Huntington's disease when a partner is the support person for the individual being tested.\nDocument [10]: Title: Juvenile Huntington's Disease: A Case Report and a Review of Diagnostic Challenges. Abstract: Juvenile Huntington's Disease (JHD) is a rare variant of the hereditary neurodegenerative disorder Huntington's disease (HD). Clinical symptoms in JHD are broad and non-specific, making the initial diagnosis difficult. In this report, we describe a young Hispanic male who gradually developed cognitive decline, dystonia, and seizures. His diagnosis was delayed despite multiple visits to his pediatrician, developmental specialist, and neurologist. A history of developmental regression and unusual imaging findings prompted genetic testing, which led to the diagnosis of JHD. Though changes in the striatum on MRI are hallmarks of JHD, family and developmental history often provide the most important diagnostic clues. Careful history-taking in patients with non-specific neurological exam findings, as in patients with JHD, can prevent diagnostic delays and allow for early interventions to improve quality of life.\nDocument [11]: Title: Best interest versus advance decisions to refuse treatment in advance care planning for neurodegenerative illness. Abstract: This article describes the role of nurses assisting people with degenerative illness in advance care planning (ACP) for a time when they may lose decision-making capacity. It looks at the concept of advance decisions to refuse treatment (ADRT), as defined in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 , exploring the legal, ethical and philosophical ramifications of carrying out, or overriding, formerly expressed wishes of someone who has subsequently lost decision-making capacity. It uses an illustrative composite case study of an individual with Huntington's disease whose prognosis includes future deterioration in swallowing, together with consideration of whether to have or refuse a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The author, who as part of his role cares for people with neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington's disease, discusses the difficulties and dilemmas that nurses experience with ADRTs, drawing on personal experience. He suggests that, rather than focusing on ADRTs, ACP may be most effective in preparing people and their surrogates to make real-time decisions, based on a shared understanding of the individual's values.\nDocument [12]: Title: The right to ignore genetic status of late onset genetic disease in the genomic era; Prenatal testing for Huntington disease as a paradigm. Abstract: During the last decade, the field of human genome research has gone through a phase of rapid discovery that has provided scientists and physicians with a wide variety of research tools that are applicable to important medical issues. We describe a true case of familial Huntington disease (HD) in which we modified personal details to protect patient's privacy, where the proband at risk preferred not to know his disease status but wanted to know the status in his unborn child. Once we found the father to be negative, the case raised an important ethical question regarding the management of this as well as future pregnancies. This article discusses the arguments for and against the right not to know of one's carrier status, as well as professional obligations in the context of withholding unwanted information that may have direct implications not only for the patient himself but also for other family members. HD has served as a model for many other adult onset genetic diseases in terms of carrier testing guidelines. Hence, we feel it is time to revisit the issue of prenatal testing for HD and consider updating the current recommendations regarding the patient's right to \"genetic ignorance\", or the right not to know genetic information.\nDocument [13]: Title: Identifying sleep disturbances in Huntington's disease using a simple disease-focused questionnaire. Abstract: Sleep disturbances have been shown to affect patients with various neurological diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). We therefore aimed to develop a sleep questionnaire that could be used by clinicians to help identify sleep disturbances in patients with the disease.Design A detailed questionnaire was used that was modelled on recent sleep questionnaires used for Parkinson's disease patients, and developed after consultation with sleep specialists. This questionnaire contained 45 questions that focused on different sleep-related issues such as duration, quality of sleep, abnormal nocturnal behaviour and quality of life. Setting Questionnaires were either completed in the home environment or in clinic.Participants 66 patients, 38 carers and 60 non-carers were recruited.Measurements & Results Various sleep-related difficulties were identified in a significantly greater proportion of HD patients compared to control subjects, with both quality and quantity of sleep being affected. Conclusions Disturbed sleep in HD may contribute towards the deterioration of the patient's ability to do activities of daily living and have a significantly deleterious effect on the quality of life of both patients and carers. This simple questionnaire should aid the clinician by providing subjective insight into the patient's sleep patterns that could enable more effective, individual-specific treatment to be instigated and ultimately improve quality of life.\nDocument [14]: Title: Quality of Life of Cypriot Patients Suffering with Huntington's Disease. Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) has profound motor, behavioural and cognitive symptoms. Despite the enormous burden of this disease on the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their families, there is very limited evidence on this topic. Considering the severity of HD patients, and the high prevalence in Cyprus more studies are needed to assess QoL among Cypriot patients, in order to improve our knowledge about their living conditions and to assist the management of this condition. Project Aim: The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess QoL among Cypriot patients with HD, using a standardized health-related QoL questionnaire.\nDocument [15]: Title: (Mis)alignments in counseling for Huntington's Disease predictive testing: clients' responses to reflective frames. Abstract: As a sequel to an earlier paper (Sarangi et al., 2004. J Genet Couns, 13(2), 135-155) examining genetic counselors' initiation of reflective frames, in this paper we analyze the variable ways in which clients respond to such reflective frames in the clinical setting. Of the six types of reflective questions identified, we focus on two types, which recur throughout the counseling protocol: (i) questions about clients' decisions to have genetic testing and (ii) questions exploring the potential impact of a positive or negative test result. The analytic focus here is on the mismatches surrounding clients' apparent readiness to discuss coping with the onset of disease (risk of disease) when they have been asked to discuss coping with genetic test results (risk of knowing). Our theoretical discussion is centered around the notion of alignment as a framework for locating the convergence and divergence of counselors' and clients' agendas in interaction. Drawing on detailed transcripts of 24 Huntington's Disease counseling consultations in South Wales, we analyze 119 counselor-client question-response sequences using the methodology of discourse analysis. Preliminary coding of clients' responses led us to identify three recurrent themes: (a) gaining knowledge as a basis for future action; (b) needing to know as a subjective necessity; and (c) downplaying what can be known. In a further analysis of extended data extracts, we draw attention to how clients display varying degrees of engagement with regard to the testing process and outcomes along the temporal and social axes. At one extreme, clients may take up the opportunity to engage in self-reflection, and thus endorse the legitimacy of the reflective frame. At the other extreme, clients may implicitly or explicitly challenge the relevance of self-reflection, and hence the usefulness of this counselor-initiated routine. We suggest that clients' varied response behaviors result from the perceived need of some clients to display their 'readiness' for predictive testing-an overarching 'meta-question' posed by the very existence of the counseling protocol.\nDocument [16]: Title: [About Huntington's disease: role of families and health professionals in information transmission]. Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. However, little information is available concerning the way each patient learns about the existence of Huntington's disease in his family and the way he transmits the information to his descendants. This study aims to specify the role of families and healthcare professionals in delivering information about the disease and its hereditary risk.\nDocument [17]: Title: Young people's experiences of growing up in a family affected by Huntington's disease. Abstract: Previous research and clinical experience suggest that Huntington's disease (HD) can considerably affect family life, particularly for young people (YP) at risk. The goal of this study was to describe the experiences of YP from families affected by HD. YP were identified through the regional genetics clinic and the Scottish Huntington's Association. In-depth interviews were used to explore YP's experiences of finding out about HD in the family; perceptions of their own risk; caring activities; protective or risk factors; and the impact of HD on relationships with siblings, parents, extended family members, and the wider community. Thirty-three YP between the ages of 9 and 28 years were interviewed. A qualitative thematic analysis was undertaken. The analysis revealed four main themes: YP as carers, the worried well, those who cope, and those at risk/in need. These themes highlight the varied experience of growing up in a family affected by HD. Whilst some YP successfully coped, others experienced considerable problems and were at risk of physical and/or emotional harm. In understanding why some cope better than others, our findings suggest protective and risk factors within these themes. In particular, participants who grew up knowing about HD from an early age seemed to cope better.\nDocument [18]: Title: Estimation of patient knowledge on rheumatoid arthritis in the range of their own disease--preliminary study. Abstract: Knowledge is an essential element of treatment which allows patients to take care of themselves, to undertake every day activities and to make decisions essential from the point of view of health. A patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis needs support, assistance from his family and from medical staff. It depends on him how much the disease will change his life and how he will cope with all the problems related to the psychological, physical and social aspects of life. Each patient should know what his disease is. If he does not receive this information from the qualified staff, he will try to find some information from different sources and then the information may be incomplete and may provoke negative reactions which will make the process of treatment more difficult.\nDocument [19]: Title: Experiences of teens living in the shadow of Huntington Disease. Abstract: Research on families with Huntington Disease (HD) has primarily focused on adult decision-making surrounding predictive genetic testing and caregiver stress. Little is known about the experiences of teens living in these families. This qualitative study explored the experiences of 32 teens living in families with HD. Six focus groups were conducted across the U.S. and Canada. Data were analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis. Huntington disease appeared to cast a shadow over the experiences described by teens. Four themes were identified: watching and waiting; alone in the midst of others; family life is kind of hard; and having to be like an adult. These experiences highlight the need for genetic counselors, health care providers, and school personnel to be aware of issues facing teens living in families with HD. Recognizing patterns of teen experiences may help health care providers develop strategies to support coping by teens in HD families.\nDocument [20]: Title: Beyond the clinical context: the process of losing oneself living with Huntington's disease. Abstract: People with Huntington's disease (HD) have increased functional and cognitive dependence. While numerous clinical, genetic, and therapeutic management studies have been carried out, few studies have investigated the disease from the personal experience and the context of people living with HD. To better serve these patients, our purpose is to understand, from the perspective of the patient and their families, how people with HD cope with their daily lives outside the clinical setting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Multiple myeloma accounts for 1.6% of all cancer cases and approximately 10% of hematologic malignancies in the United States. In 2015, an estimated 28,850 new cases of multiple myeloma were diagnosed in the United States, and the disease caused more than 11,000 deaths. Patients older than 65 years account for 85% of those diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and there is a twofold increased incidence in blacks compared with whites. Patients may present with bone pain or with symptoms that are often nonspecific, such as nausea, vomiting, malaise, weakness, recurrent infections, and weight loss. Many patients present with only laboratory abnormalities, such as anemia, renal disease, and elevated protein levels. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma requires increased numbers of immature, abnormal, or atypical plasma cells in the bone marrow; a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine; or characteristic bone lesions. The diagnostic workup in a patient with suspected multiple myeloma should include a complete blood count with differential; serum chemistries; creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and beta2-microglobulin tests; immunoglobulin studies; skeletal survey; and bone marrow evaluation. Initiation of chemotherapy and assessment of eligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation require referral to an oncologist. Most patients with multiple myeloma will receive thromboprophylaxis, bisphosphonate therapy, and prophylaxis against infection at some point in their treatment. Family physicians play a role in assessing these patients for infection, adverse treatment effects, and renal and thrombotic complications, and in managing issues related to pain, nutrition, and psychosocial support.\nDocument [2]: Title: Better therapy requires better response evaluation: Paving the way for minimal residual disease testing for every myeloma patient. Abstract: In 2015, there is a large body of evidence demonstrating that minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity after therapy is a powerful predictor of progression-free survival and overall survival in multiple myeloma. On the basis of available data, we believe MRD provides a meaningful endpoint for regulatory purposes, academic studies, and a valuable prognostic evaluation of individual patients in the clinical setting. Similar to what has been shown in acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, based on emerging data, the prognostic impact of MRD in multiple myeloma appears to be independent of induction therapy received. This fact raises fundamental questions regarding best possible treatment strategies (e.g., fixed number of cycles versus response adapted number of cycles) as well as optimal treatment modalities (e.g., newer effective but less intense combination therapies versus high dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation), in particular for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma.\nDocument [3]: Title: Shall we treat smoldering multiple myeloma in the near future? Abstract: In recent years, several new drugs have been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Many of these newer drugs are highly efficacious and less toxic than older chemotherapy drugs. In 2014, the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma were revised. The intent with the new criteria was to identify patients who require therapy at an earlier stage than at manifestation of organ complications. A subset of patients who were previously defined as having high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma was redefined as having multiple myeloma. In this context, it is logical to raise questions regarding the optimal clinical management of patients who are diagnosed with smoldering multiple myeloma in the current era. When is the optimal time to start therapy? Do the clinical trajectories for patients suggest there are distinct sub-entities hidden in the current category of smoldering multiple myeloma? How can we move the field forward from here? This paper reviews and dissects data and models on the topics of clinical features, underlying biology, and early treatment trials in smoldering multiple myeloma. The text highlights assumptions, facts, and gaps in the literature. As indicated in the title of the paper, the recurrent theme of the text is this: shall we treat smoldering multiple myeloma in the near future?\nDocument [4]: Title: False Elevation of Troponin in a Case of Multiple Myeloma. Abstract: Falsely elevated troponin has been reported in the literature. The authors present a case of a 51-year-old man who was admitted with nausea, vomiting, and chest discomfort. He was found to have elevated troponin with no electrocardiographic changes. He has normal coronaries on angiogram and normal echocardiogram. A diagnostic time-out and second look at the laboratory values captured abnormalities that triggered a workup that ruled in a multiple myeloma diagnosis. We suspected falsely elevated troponin levels secondary to macrotroponin, a complex of elevated immunoglobulin levels and troponin, which has been rarely reported to cause elevated troponin levels in patients with multiple myeloma.\nDocument [5]: Title: Current treatment options for myeloma. Abstract: In most cases multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell malignancy. Despite the use of conventional therapy or high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), patients continue to relapse at a constant rate. A small minority of patients are cured by allogeneic transplantation. Novel drugs targeting not only the myeloma cell but also its interactions with the malignant microenvironment have recently been used in patients with relapsed/refractory disease. So far, ASCT has been the treatment of choice for eligible myeloma patients. However, many questions regarding the management of myeloma patients remain unanswered. How safe is ASCT in elderly patients? Is there a role for non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation in multiple myeloma? What is the role of novel agents, such as thalidomide, its analogues and bortezomib, in the treatment of newly diagnosed patients or as maintenance post-ASCT? This review summarises all available data for the current treatment options for myeloma providing a useful algorithm for its management.\nDocument [6]: Title: A plain language summary of daratumumab plus lenalidomide/bortezomib/dexamethasone in transplant-eligible Black patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the GRIFFIN study. Abstract: Label=\"WHAT IS THIS SUMMARY ABOUT?\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">This is a summary of a publication about Black participants of the GRIFFIN clinical study that was published in <i>Blood Cancer Journal</i> in April 2022. The GRIFFIN clinical study looked at the treatment combination of daratumumab plus a standard therapy for multiple myeloma (called RVd therapy, which stands for lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone) in adult patients who had not been treated before for multiple myeloma and so were considered to have newly diagnosed multiply myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer of plasma cells. Based on the participants' age, medical history, and indicators of good general health, the participants in the GRIFFIN study were also eligible to receive autologous stem cell transplant as part of their therapy. This summary describes results for the Black participants of the GRIFFIN clinical study who received daratumumab plus RVd therapy (called D-RVd) to see if D-RVd therapy is better than RVd therapy at reducing the amount of multiple myeloma cancer cells in a patient's body.\nDocument [7]: Title: Consensus recommendations for standard investigative workup: report of the International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel 3. Abstract: A panel of members of the 2009 International Myeloma Workshop developed guidelines for standard investigative workup of patients with suspected multiple myeloma. Both serum and urine should be assessed for monoclonal protein. Measurement of monoclonal protein both by densitometer tracing and/by nephelometric quantitation is recommended, and immunofixation is required for confirmation. The serum-free light chain assay is recommended in all newly diagnosed patients with plasma cell dyscrasias. Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy along with demonstration of clonality of plasma cells are necessary. Serum \u03b2(2)-microglobulin, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase are necessary for prognostic purposes. Standard metaphase cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization for 17p, t(4;14), and t(14;16) are recommended. The skeletal survey remains the standard method for imaging screening, but magnetic resonance imaging frequently provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. Most of these tests are repeated during follow-up or at relapse.\nDocument [8]: Title: Two cases of low back pain of unknown etiology diagnosed as multiple myeloma. Abstract: We report two cases of patients complaining of lumbar back pain of unknown etiology which were finally diagnosed as multiple myeloma. The first case was a woman in her 80s with a chief complaint of lumbar back pain. The second case was a male in his 70s. He also consulted our institution because his pain did not subside despite receiving increased doses of oral medication and nerve blocks from his previous doctor. Both patients presented with compression fractures on plain radiography, and additionally with cytopenia, hyperproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia in blood tests. Further tests were conducted due to suspected multiple myeloma, revealing a punched-out legion in the skull and elevated levels of \u03b22 microglobulin and Immunoglobulin G. Subsequently, both patients were transferred to the hematology department. In these two cases, we had predicted the presence of multiple myeloma from the results of initial testing and subsequently successfully provided definitive diagnoses following additional examinations.\nDocument [9]: Title: Chemotherapy-Related Differences in Cognitive Functioning and Their Biological Predictors in Patients with Multiple Myeloma. Abstract: The paper presents a study on the changes in cognitive functioning in patients undergoing chemotherapy with diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of the study was to answer the following two main research questions: Does the treatment stage differentiate the functioning of cognitive processes in patients with diagnosed MM and to what extent? Is it possible to treat biological factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and BDNF) as predictors of patients' cognitive functioning? The patients were examined twice, before the treatment and after 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy. Selected neuropsychological research methods as well as experimental and clinical trials were employed to diagnose the patients' general cognitive state, attention, memory, and executive functions. The level of biological factors was assessed with the ELISA test. The results show that the patients' cognitive functioning was worse before the treatment than during the cytostatic therapy. It was also possible to predict the cognitive state of patients suffering from multiple myeloma based on a selected biological parameter (neurotrophin BDNF).\nDocument [10]: Title: International myeloma working group consensus statement and guidelines regarding the current role of imaging techniques in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple Myeloma. Abstract: Several imaging technologies are used for the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Conventional radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear medicine imaging are all used in an attempt to better clarify the extent of bone disease and soft tissue disease in MM. This review summarizes all available data in the literature and provides recommendations for the use of each of the technologies. Conventional radiography still remains the 'gold standard' of the staging procedure of newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma patients. MRI gives information complementary to skeletal survey and is recommended in MM patients with normal conventional radiography and in all patients with an apparently solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Urgent MRI or CT (if MRI is not available) is the diagnostic procedure of choice to assess suspected cord compression. Bone scintigraphy has no place in the routine staging of myeloma, whereas sequential dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans are not recommended. Positron emission tomography/CT or MIBI imaging are also not recommended for routine use in the management of myeloma patients, although both techniques may be useful in selected cases that warrant clarification of previous imaging findings, but such an approach should ideally be made within the context of a clinical trial.\nDocument [11]: Title: The consultant's guide to smoldering multiple myeloma. Abstract: Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic precursor condition to multiple myeloma (MM). The prevalence of SMM is 0.5% in persons over 40 years old; it is higher in men than women and increases with age. When SMM is diagnosed, a thorough diagnostic workup is necessary to exclude myeloma-defining events and stratify patients according to risk of progression to MM. While close monitoring for progression remains the best management for most patients with SMM, in this article, we discuss if treatment initiation before myeloma-defining events occur might be relevant in selected high-risk cases. Two randomized clinical trials have shown a clinical benefit of initiating treatment at the SMM stage, whereof 1 showed an overall survival benefit for those receiving treatment. We discuss various risk stratification models in SMM, important treatment trials, and ongoing trials. Finally, we present how to approach the clinical management of patients with SMM.\nDocument [12]: Title: Metastatic breast cancer or multiple myeloma? Camouflage by lytic lesions. Abstract: We report a case of a female with stage I infiltrating ductal carcinoma who received adjuvant therapy including trastuzumab. One year later she developed lytic lesions and was retreated with trastuzumab that was held after she developed symptomatic heart failure. Lytic lesions were attributed to relapse of breast cancer, and cardiac failure attributed to prior trastuzumab therapy. After complications necessitated multiple hospitalizations, a further workup revealed that the lytic lesions were not metastatic breast cancer but multiple myeloma. Her advanced multiple myeloma was associated with systemic amyloidosis involving gut and heart, which ultimately led to her demise. This report addresses the pitfalls of overlapping symptoms and the question of which patients with suspected metastatic disease should undergo a biopsy.\nDocument [13]: Title: Multiple Myeloma Associated Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy: The Importance of Continued Surveillance. Abstract: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an autoimmune disease presenting with weakness and numbness in a remitting or chronic progressive course. It is known to have several clinical presentations and several associated diseases. CIDP has been associated with multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and other paraproteinemias. We present a case of refractory CIDP in which the initial workup for multiple myeloma was negative, and multiple myeloma was then diagnosed two and half years later. Treatment of the multiple myeloma led to clinical improvement. This case is instructive in that perhaps more frequent surveillance for paraproteinemia in patients with CIPD, even after a negative initial workup, could lead to a better clinical outcome.\nDocument [14]: Title: Update of thrombosis in multiple myeloma. Abstract: With the introduction of thalidomide and multi-agent chemotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma around 15years ago a strongly increased risk of venous thrombosis was observed. The occurrence of venous thrombosis in multiple myeloma is not only determined by the kind of treatment, but also by several other factors, including disease specific factors, patient-specific factors, changes in pro-and anticoagulant factors and fibrinolysis. Studies showed a prevalence of up to 25% in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Therefore these patients nowadays receive prophylaxis with aspirin, low molecular weight heparin or warfarin in order to reduce the risk of venous thrombosis. It is however still debatable which patients should receive prophylaxis and what the best kind of prophylaxis is, considering both the risk of thrombosis and the risk of bleeding. In recent years several new anti-myeloma agents have been developed and investigated in large clinical studies. The risk of thrombosis using these new drugs seems less than with thalidomide and lenalidomide-based regimens. In this article an update on prevention and management of thrombotic events in patients with multiple myeloma is given.\nDocument [15]: Title: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) caused by multiple myeloma: the diagnostic value of the Naprosyn test. Abstract: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) remains a difficult diagnostic problem. The causes of FUO have changed over the years. Neoplastic disorders have now displaced infectious diseases as the most common cause of FUOs. Most neoplasms are associated with no or low-grade temperatures, with some important exceptions. Hypernephromas and lymphomas are neoplasms typically associated with high spiking fevers or may present as FUOs. Hematologic malignancies, that is, the acute and chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders, and multiple myeloma, do not usually present with acute fevers or as FUOs. We present an elderly male patient who presented with an FUO, whose history is significant for multiple myeloma in remission. Differential diagnostic possibilities in this patient included plasma cell leukemia, relapse of multiple myeloma, secondary/superimposed malignancy, or opportunistic infection. The main differential diagnosis for his FUO was between neoplastic and infectious disorders. As part of the diagnostic workup, a Naprosyn test (naproxen 375 mg [by mouth] every 12 hours for 3 days) was used to differentiate neoplastic from infectious causes of FUO in this patient. The Naprosyn test was positive, which indicated a neoplastic explanation for the patient's FUO and eliminated, along with the infectious disease workup, an infectious explanation for his FUO. The patient's FUO was finally determined to be the result of a relapse of multiple myeloma and not of a secondary malignancy or malignant transformation of myeloma into plasma cell leukemia. We conclude the Naprosyn test remains a valuable diagnostic test to use to narrow differential diagnostic possibilities in patients with FUOs when a malignancy is a diagnostic consideration.\nDocument [16]: Title: Integrating novel agents into multiple myeloma treatment - current status in Switzerland and treatment recommendations. Abstract: The treatment of multiple myeloma has undergone significant changes in the recent past. The arrival of novel agents, especially thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide, has expanded treatment options and patient outcomes are improving significantly. This article summarises the discussions of an expert meeting which was held to debate current treatment practices for multiple myeloma in Switzerland concerning the role of the novel agents and to provide recommendations for their use in different treatment stages based on currently available clinical data. Novel agent combinations for the treatment of newly diagnosed, as well as relapsed multiple myeloma are examined. In addition, the role of novel agents in patients with cytogenetic abnormalities and renal impairment, as well as the management of the most frequent side effects of the novel agents are discussed. The aim of this article is to assist in treatment decisions in daily clinical practice to achieve the best possible outcome for patients with multiple myeloma.\nDocument [17]: Title: An observational study assessing peripheral neuropathy related to multiple myeloma. Abstract: We aimed at assessing the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in newly diagnosed, treatment-na\u00efve patients with multiple myeloma. We enrolled 153 patients with multiple myeloma at initial diagnosis. All patients underwent neurological examination and nerve conduction study. Patients with suspected pure small fiber neuropathy underwent skin biopsy. Of the 153 patients included in this study, 7.2 % had a multiple myeloma-related neuropathy. All patients suffered from a distal symmetric sensory peripheral neuropathy, associated with age (P = 0.04). Our study on prevalence rate of multiple myeloma-related peripheral neuropathy might provide a basis for improving the clinical management of this condition.\nDocument [18]: Title: European Myeloma Network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: what to use and when. Abstract: The diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be challenging, even for experienced physicians, and requires close collaboration between numerous disciplines (orthopedics, radiology, nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, hematology and oncology) before the final diagnosis of myeloma is made. The definition of multiple myeloma is based on the presence of clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and radiological markers of disease. Specific tests are needed both at presentation and during follow-up in order to reach the correct diagnosis and characterize the disease precisely. These tests can also serve prognostic purposes and are useful for follow-up of myeloma patients. Molecular analyses remain pivotal for defining high-risk myeloma and are used in updated patient stratifications, while minimal residual disease assessment via flow cytometry, molecular techniques and radiological approaches provides additional prognostic information on patients' long-term outcome. This pivotal information will guide our future treatment decisions in forthcoming clinical trials. The European Myeloma Network group updated their guidelines on different diagnostic recommendations, which should be of value to enable appropriate use of the recommendations both at diagnosis and during follow-up.\nDocument [19]: Title: SOHO State of the Art Updates and Next Questions: Treatment of Older, Vulnerable Adults with Multiple Myeloma. Abstract: Multiple myeloma is primarily a disease of the elderly, and optimal treatments must weigh the risks of toxicity with the benefits of therapy. Frailty scales have been developed to aid treatment-decision making for older adults with MM. This review provides a framework for incorporating frailty scales into clinical care and highlights how patient-aligned priorities for care can influence the management of older or more vulnerable adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We review the currently available systemic therapies for managing older or more vulnerable adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma otherwise considered ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation.\nDocument [20]: Title: Multiple myeloma presenting as recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Abstract: Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy that classically presents with bone pain secondary to osteolytic lesions, anemia, and renal insufficiency. A 49-year-old man presented for workup of possible primary immunodeficiency due to a history of recurrent sinopulmonary infection and abnormal immunoglobulin levels. He was subsequently diagnosed with multiple myeloma, despite a lack of typical symptoms. The correct diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be easily overlooked, especially in a patient with recurrent infections but no other signs or symptoms typical of myeloma.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Sports medicine is a medical specialty that supports the performance of professional and amateur athletes while maintaining their health. Sports medicine professionals need to ensure the safe participation of athletes in sports activities achieved through a periodical preparticipation evaluation (PPE) and a regular medical monitoring of the athletes' health in accordance with the latest recommendations regarding health condition and medical history, physical working capacity, training period and programme, recovery, nutrition, use of supplements, injuries prevention and safe return to play. In order to harmonise these national variations in the content and application of the PPE, the EFSMA Scientific and Educational Commission proposes a 'gold standard' for elite athletes across Europe. Important objectives of PPE are early detection and prevention of severe complications during sports activities both in leisure time and competitive sports. The PPE should entail the following diagnostic components: health status, anthropometry, functional and exercise capacity. It is of utmost importance to develop and implement preventive strategies such as the PPE. Besides monitoring the health status of athletes, the PPE plays an important role in the selection process, bringing valuable information for coaches and supporting a personalised treatment approach. Screening of athletes through a standardised digital PPE could be beneficial for a better understanding of the impact of long-term physical activity. Furthermore, PPE leads the scientific community to a way of working closer together in the interest of the athletes.\nDocument [2]: Title: Preparticipation Physical Exams: The Rhode Island Perspective, A Call for Standardization. Abstract: As of 2015, 98% of U.S. states require preparticipation exams (PPE) before participating in scholastic sports. Despite widespread availability of a PPE monograph endorsed by six medical societies, a lack of uniformity exists regarding implementation of the PPE among Rhode Island health care providers (HCPs). Consequently, significant variability exists regarding how comprehensive a history and physical exam screening is conducted for adolescent athletes looking for sports participation clearance. The purpose of this document is to: 1) establish a uniform screening process in Rhode Island for the PPE utilizing a peer-reviewed history and physical exam; 2) familiarize HCPs with the 2010 PPE monograph, with emphasis on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal (MSK) systems; 3) encourage HCPs to treat the PPE as a separate entity from the annual wellness visit; 4) engage HCPs and sports medicine providers in Rhode Island to improve the quality and process of evaluating adolescent athletes for sports participation.

Abstract: The preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is a common reason for young athletes to see a primary care physician. An annual PPE is required by most state high school athletic associations for participation in school-based sports, although there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness for detecting conditions that predispose athletes to injury or illness. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics, with representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians and other organizations, published updated PPE recommendations (PPE5). According to the guideline, the general goals of the PPE are determining general physical and psychological health; evaluating for life-threatening or disabling conditions, including risk of sudden cardiac arrest and other conditions that may predispose the athlete to illness or injury; and serving as an entry point into the health care system for those without a medical home or primary care physician. The guideline recommends that the evaluation take place in the physician's office rather than in a group setting. The PPE should include a structured physical examination that focuses on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. Screening for depression, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recommended. Clinicians should recognize any findings suggestive of the relative energy deficiency in sport syndrome. Additional consideration is required to address the needs and concerns of transgender athletes and athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. Finally, guidelines have been published regarding return to play for athletes who have had COVID-19.\nDocument [4]: Title: Athlete Preparticipation Physical Evaluation. Abstract: Preparticipation evaluations (PPE) are both a traditional and legal requirement by many governing bodies for sport. The ideal goal of the PPE is safe participation in sport for athletes. This article provides an overview of common PPE elements and current best practice recommendations. Descriptions of every possible examination are published elsewhere and are beyond the intent of this article. Additional considerations for transgender, masters athletes, and Special Olympians are also outside the scope of this review, but are well covered in The Preparticipation Physical Evaluation, fifth edition monograph.\nDocument [5]: Title: The Preparticipation Physical Evaluation. Abstract: With rising rates of sports participation among children and adolescents, pediatricians are increasingly being called upon to perform preparticipation physical evaluations (PPEs) for young athletes. The purpose of this review article is to discuss the general structure of a comprehensive PPE and how the PPE differs from a typical health maintenance visit. The PPE focuses attention on screening for cardiac conditions that predispose athletes to sudden cardiac death with exercise. This review also addresses the debate over whether electrocardiogram screening should be a routine required part of the PPE. In addition to cardiac screening, evaluation and management of musculoskeletal injury, concussion, and the female athlete triad will be discussed in greater detail. [Pediatr Ann. 2017;46(3):e85-e92.].\nDocument [6]: Title: Advancing the preparticipation physical evaluation: an ACSM and FIMS joint consensus statement. Abstract: : While the preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is widely accepted, its usage and content are not standardized. Implementation is affected by cost, access, level of participation, participant age/sex, and local/regional/national mandate. Preparticipation physical evaluation screening costs are generally borne by the athlete, family, or club. Screening involves generally agreed-upon questions based on expert opinion and tested over decades of use. No large-scale prospective controlled tracking programs have examined PPE outcomes. While the panel did not reach consensus on electrocardiogram (ECG) screening as a routine part of PPE, all agreed that a history and physical exam focusing on cardiac risk is essential, and an ECG should be used where risk is increased. The many areas of consensus should help the American College of Sports Medicine and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du M\u00e9dicine du Sport in developing a universally accepted PPE. An electronic PPE, using human-centered design, would be comprehensive, would provide a database given that PPE is mandatory in many locations, would simplify PPE administration, would allow remote access to clinical data, and would provide the much-needed data for prospective studies in this area.\nDocument [7]: Title: Preparticipation Sports Physicals: A Comparison of Single Provider and Station-Based Models. Abstract: Preparticipation physical examinations (PPEs) are required for children and adolescents before sports participation to identify at-risk athletes. These evaluations can be completed in a traditional office-based setting or in a station-based format. It is unclear if one format is superior to the other in identifying at-risk athletes.\nDocument [8]: Title: AMSSM Position Statement on Cardiovascular Preparticipation Screening in Athletes: Current Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, Recommendations, and Future Directions. Abstract: Cardiovascular (CV) screening in young athletes is widely recommended and routinely performed before participation in competitive sports. While there is general agreement that early detection of cardiac conditions at risk for sudden cardiac arrest and death (SCA/D) is an important objective, the optimal strategy for CV screening in athletes remains an issue of considerable debate. At the center of the controversy is the addition of a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) to the standard preparticipation evaluation using history and physical examination. The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) formed a task force to address the current evidence and knowledge gaps regarding preparticipation CV screening in athletes from the perspective of a primary care sports medicine physician. The absence of definitive outcomes-based evidence at this time precludes AMSSM from endorsing any single or universal CV screening strategy for all athletes including legislative mandates. This statement presents a new paradigm to assist the individual physician in assessing the most appropriate CV screening strategy unique to their athlete population, community needs, and resources. The decision to implement a CV screening program, with or without the addition of ECG, necessitates careful consideration of the risk of SCA/D in the targeted population and the availability of cardiology resources and infrastructure. Importantly, it is the individual physician's assessment in the context of an emerging evidence base that the chosen model for early detection of cardiac disorders in the specific population provides greater benefit than harm. American Medical Society for Sports Medicine is committed to advancing evidenced-based research and educational initiatives that will validate and promote the most efficacious strategies to foster safe sport participation and reduce SCA/D in athletes.\nDocument [9]: Title: HPV Immunization in High School Student-Athletes Receiving Preparticipation Physical Evaluations at Mass Event Versus Other Venues. Abstract: The preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is a requirement for high school sport participation in most states, but its location and role in preventive health care for adolescents is often questioned.\nDocument [10]: Title: Sport activities for children and adolescents: the Position of the European Academy of Paediatrics and the European Confederation of Primary Care Paediatricians 2023-Part 1. Pre-participation physical evaluation in young athletes. Abstract: The European Academy of Paediatrics (EAP) and the European Confederation of Primary Care Paediatricians (ECPCP) emphasize the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles within the pediatric population. Many health professionals have questions concerning adequate levels of physical activity for both the healthy pediatric population and for those who may have specific complications. Unfortunately, the academic literature that provides recommendations for participation in sport activities within the pediatric population that have been published during the last decade in Europe is limited and is mainly dedicated to specific illnesses or advanced athletes and not toward the general population. The aim of part 1 of the EAP and ECPCP position statement is to assist healthcare professionals in implementing the best management strategies for a pre-participation evaluation (PPE) for participation in sports for individual children and adolescents. In the absence of a uniform protocol, it is necessary to respect physician autonomy for choosing and implementing the most appropriate and familiar PPE screening strategy and to discuss the decisions made with young athletes and their families. This first part of the Position Statement concerning Sport Activities for Children and Adolescents is dedicated to healthy young athletes.\nDocument [11]: Title: Wilderness Preparticipation Evaluation and Considerations for Special Populations. Abstract: Children, older adults, disabled and special needs athletes, and female athletes who participate in outdoor and wilderness sports and activities each face unique risks. For children and adolescents traveling to high altitude, the preparticipation physical evaluation should focus on risk assessment, prevention strategies, early recognition of altitude-related symptoms, management plans, and appropriate follow-up. As the risk and prevalence of chronic disease increases with age, both older patients and providers need to be aware of disease and medication-specific risks relative to wilderness sport and activity participation. Disabled and special needs athletes benefit from careful pre-event planning for the potential medical issues and equipment modifications that may affect their health in wilderness environments. Issues that demand special consideration for female adventurers include pregnancy, contraceptive use, menses, and ferritin levels at altitude. A careful preparticipation evaluation that factors in unique, population-specific risks will help special populations stay healthy and safe on wilderness adventures. The PubMed and SportDiscus databases were searched in 2014 using both MeSH terms and text words and include peer-reviewed English language articles from 1977 to 2014. Additional information was accessed from Web-based sources to produce this narrative review on preparticipation evaluation for special populations undertaking wilderness adventures. Key words include children, adolescent, pediatric, seniors, elderly, disabled, special needs, female, athlete, preparticipiation examination, wilderness medicine, and sports.\nDocument [12]: Title: Wilderness Preparticipation Evaluation and Considerations for Special Populations.

Abstract: While the preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is widely accepted, its usage and content are not standardized. Implementation is affected by cost, access, level of participation, participant age/sex, and local/regional/national mandate. PPE screening costs are generally borne by the athlete, family, or club. Screening involves generally agreed-upon questions based on expert opinion and tested over decades of use. No large-scale prospective controlled tracking programs have examined PPE outcomes. While the panel did not reach consensus on electrocardiogram screening as a routine part of PPE, all agreed that a history and physical exam focusing on cardiac risk is essential, and an ECG should be used where risk is increased. The many areas of consensus should help the American College of Sports Medicine and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du M\u00e9dicine du Sport in developing a universally accepted PPE. An electronic PPE, using human-centered design, would be comprehensive, would provide a database given that PPE is mandatory in many locations, would simplify PPE administration, would allow remote access to clinical data, and would provide the much-needed data for prospective studies in this area.\nDocument [14]: Title: AMSSM Position Statement on Cardiovascular Preparticipation Screening in Athletes: Current Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, Recommendations and Future Directions. Abstract: Cardiovascular screening in young athletes is widely recommended and routinely performed prior to participation in competitive sports. While there is general agreement that early detection of cardiac conditions at risk for sudden cardiac arrest and death (SCA/D) is an important objective, the optimal strategy for cardiovascular screening in athletes remains an issue of considerable debate. At the center of the controversy is the addition of a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) to the standard preparticipation evaluation using history and physical examination. The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) formed a task force to address the current evidence and knowledge gaps regarding preparticipation cardiovascular screening in athletes from the perspective of a primary care sports medicine physician. The absence of definitive outcomes-based evidence at this time precludes AMSSM from endorsing any single or universal cardiovascular screening strategy for all athletes, including legislative mandates. This statement presents a new paradigm to assist the individual physician in assessing the most appropriate cardiovascular screening strategy unique to their athlete population, community needs, and resources. The decision to implement a cardiovascular screening program, with or without the addition of ECG, necessitates careful consideration of the risk of SCA/D in the targeted population and the availability of cardiology resources and infrastructure. Importantly, it is the individual physician's assessment in the context of an emerging evidence-base that the chosen model for early detection of cardiac disorders in the specific population provides greater benefit than harm. AMSSM is committed to advancing evidenced-based research and educational initiatives that will validate and promote the most efficacious strategies to foster safe sport participation and reduce SCA/D in athletes.\nDocument [15]: Title: AMSSM Position Statement on Cardiovascular Preparticipation Screening in Athletes: Current evidence, knowledge gaps, recommendations and future directions.

Abstract: The preparticipation physical evaluation is a commonly requested medical visit for amateur and professional athletes of all ages. The overarching goal is to maximize the health of athletes and their safe participation in sports. Although studies have not found that the preparticipation physical evaluation prevents morbidity and mortality associated with sports, it may detect conditions that predispose the athlete to injury or illness and can provide strategies to prevent injuries. Clearance depends on the outcome of the evaluation and the type of sport (and sometimes position or event) in which the athlete participates. All persons undergoing a preparticipation physical evaluation should be questioned about exertional symptoms, presence of a heart murmur, symptoms of Marfan syndrome, and family history of premature serious cardiac conditions or sudden death. The physical examination should focus on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. U.S. medical and athletic organizations discourage screening electrocardiography and blood and urine testing in asymptomatic patients. Further evaluation should be considered for persons with heart or lung disease, bleeding disorders, musculoskeletal problems, history of concussion, or other neurologic disorders.\nDocument [17]: Title: Counseling for the Wilderness Athlete and Adventurer During a Preparticipation Evaluation for Preparation, Safety, and Injury Prevention. Abstract: Wilderness sports and adventures continue to increase in popularity. Counseling is an essential element of the preparticipation evaluation (PPE) for athletes in traditional sports. This approach can be applied to and augmented for the wilderness athlete and adventurer. The authors reviewed the literature on counseling during PPEs and gathered expert opinion from medical professionals who perform such PPEs for wilderness sports enthusiasts. The objective was to present findings of this review and make recommendations on the counseling component of a wilderness sports/adventure PPE. The counseling component of a PPE for wilderness sports/adventures should take place after a basic medical evaluation, and include a discussion on sport or activity-specific injury prevention, personal health, travel recommendations, and emergency event planning. Counseling should be individualized and thorough, and involve shared decision making. This should take place early enough to allow ample time for the athlete or adventurer to further prepare as needed based on the recommendations. Resources may be recommended for individuals desiring more information on selected topics.\nDocument [18]: Title: Counseling for the Wilderness Athlete and Adventurer During a Preparticipation Evaluation for Preparation, Safety, and Injury Prevention.

Position statement of Chilean Scientific Societies]. Abstract: The Preparticipation Physical Evaluation (PPE), defined as \"the health supervision of individuals, prior to the practice of physical activity and/or sports, which seeks to optimize their safe participation in sports and provide an opportunity to identify current and future risks to their health and quality of life\", inclu des the Cardiovascular assessment, which aims to screen cardiovascular pathologies with the risk of worsening or sudden death during exercise. Although there is broad international consensus that the use of Pediatric Cardiovascular PPE in young athletes is useful, there is no consensus on whether this should be used in the entire pediatric population or on which is the best strategy to apply. This article presents the position of the scientific societies related to sport, physical activity and child health on the Pediatric Cardiovascular PPE.\nDocument [20]: Title: Missed Opportunities in the Preparticipation Physical Examination for High School Athletes. Abstract: The preparticipation sports examination (PPE) is required for US high school athletes. We queried members of the Illinois Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (ICAAP) about what they actually include in a PPE, allotted PPE time, and counseling about full contact sports participation. Of 2300 ICAAP members contacted electronically, 228 (10%) responded, yielding 205 usable surveys. When performing a PPE, 34 (25%) always complete all of 6 selected AAP-recommended PPE components and 102 (74%) always get a concussion history. In contrast, 29 (21%) always complete all of the 6 selected AAP PPE components and 70 (49%) always get a concussion history as part of well-child checkup. Main interferences with clinician proficiency are lack of time and training cited by 49% and 37%, respectively. Pediatricians were evenly divided about whether or not to counsel against full contact sports, but were more likely to do so after the athlete sustained a first concussion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: This study reports on vocal cord paralysis caused by esophageal button battery (BB) ingestion in children. Medical records of children with vocal cord paralysis and esophageal BB ingestion treated at a tertiary referral institute between January 2016 and March 2020 were reviewed. Five patients aged 9-58 months were identified; three were male. Each patient had accidentally swallowed a 20-mm-diameter lithium battery (3 CR2032 type and 2 CR2025 type). One battery was removed within 4 h after ingestion, and three batteries were removed within 12 h. Removal of the battery was achieved with rigid esophagoscopy in four patients and direct laryngoscopy in one patient. Four patients had bilateral, and one had unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Three patients underwent tracheotomy; two were tracheotomy-dependent until follow-up, while the third patient died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome a month after surgery. The two cases without tracheotomy remain under close follow-up.Conclusion: Accidentally ingested button batteries should be removed promptly to avoid severe complications. Respiratory support and neurotrophic treatment in the early stage of vocal cord paralysis may be beneficial for recovery of vocal cord movement. What is Known: \u2022 Button battery ingestion in children is extremely harmful, especially when the diameter of the button battery exceeds 20 mm. \u2022 Esophageal button battery impaction can cause serious complications such as esophageal perforation, mediastinal infection, tracheoesophageal fistula, vocal cord paralysis, and life-threatening bleeding. What is New: \u2022 Vocal cord paralysis in children with button battery ingestion plays an early warning role for identifying the severity of the disease. \u2022 Early neurotrophic drugs and glucocorticoid therapy may be helpful for the recovery of vocal cord movement, thereby avoiding tracheotomy.\nDocument [2]: Title: Bilateral vocal cord paralysis secondary to head and neck surgery. Abstract: Even endotracheal intubation could be considered safe in operations under general anesthesia; rarely, it could cause recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis as a complication. As mentioned in the literature, as a possible reason for this, anterior branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the larynx could suffer from compression between the posteromedial part of the thyroid cartilage and the cuff of the tube. In the literature, unilateral vocal cord paralysis due to endotracheal intubation occurs more frequently in comparison to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. These types of palsies usually totally improve in approximately 6 months. A patient who experienced bilateral vocal cord paralysis in the early postoperative period after undergoing an endotracheal intubation process for general anesthesia and primary partial lip resection and supraomohyoid neck dissection due to lower lip carcinoma is presented in our article. Although vocal cord paralysis occurring after head and neck surgery is first thought as a complication of the surgery, endotracheal intubation should be considered as a possible cause of this paralysis. In relation with this patient, causes, clinical symptoms, and treatment procedures of vocal cord paralysis due to endotracheal intubation are discussed under guidance of the literature.\nDocument [3]: Title: Treatment of bilateral vocal cord paralysis following permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Abstract: Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is a serious illness requiring emergency intervention to resolve the potentially life-threatening respiratory distress. Several surgical procedures were proposed to help improve the airway and to eliminate the tracheostoma in those patients with permanent paralysis. All the procedures have their own advantages and disadvantages. We conducted a retrospective study of 30 patients affected by bilateral vocal cord paralysis following total thyroidectomy. All the patients underwent total thyroidectomy for benign thyroid pathology. In 26 patients (86.6%), cord paralysis occurred during the perioperative stage; and in the remaining 4 cases (13.3%), it occurred within the following 6 months. We treated all these bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis patients with arytenoidectomy alone in 5 patients and arytenoidectomy with concomitant true and false posterior cordectomy in the remaining 25 patients. Twenty-four of the 25 patients who underwent the combined procedures (96%) reported subjective respiratory improvement and were decannulated within 60 days, being able to return to their normal daily activities. This study demonstrates that arytenoidectomy associated with posterior cordectomy is a satisfactory surgical treatment of bilateral vocal cord paralysis because it leads to a considerable and stable enlargement of the breathing space.\nDocument [4]: Title: Ultrasound diagnosis of a case of transient bilateral vocal cord paralysis secondary to local anesthetic infiltration. Abstract: One of the most important complications associated with thyroid and parathyroid surgery is vocal cord paralysis due to a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury paralysis induced by local anesthetics is a rare complication with very few published cases Various techniques are available for diagnosing vocal cord paralysis, including, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, videostrobolaryngoscopy and indirect laryngoscopy. However, these techniques are expensive and are often associated with pain and discomfort among patients. Considering these disadvantages, transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasound is an alternative imaging tool for vocal cord examination in patients undergoing thyroid and parathyroid surgery. We describe a case which was sonographically diagnosed a transient bilateral vocal cord paralysis after the local infiltration of 10mL of 2% mepivacaine administered for the revision of the surgical wound due to a subcutaneous hematoma that occurred after a subtotal parathyroidectomy.\nDocument [5]: Title: Bilateral vocal cord paralysis associated with laryngeal myxedema. Abstract: For managing dyspnea caused by bilateral vocal cord paralysis as a complication of thyroidectomy in the acute postoperative period, reversible vocal cord lateralisation is performed at the authors' departments. However, in the later postoperative period of thyroidectomy when there is no chance for recovery of the recurrent laryngeal nerves, they perform irreversible procedure. Applying these operative techniques satisfactory breathing can be achieved in about 95% of cases avoiding tracheostomy. In 5% of cases there are other comorbidities in the background of unsuccessful operative results which can cause potential dyspnea as well. From these complications the authors emphasize the role of laryngeal obstruction and myxedema as a consequence of hypothyroidism developed after thyroidectomy. Management of severe dyspnea caused by association of these two complications of thyroidectomy means a great therapeutic challenge. Between 01 Jan 1989 and 30 Nov 2008 the authors performed 161 reversible and 135 irreversible vocal cord lateralisations to manage dyspnea caused by bilateral vocal cord paralysis as a complication of thyroidectomy. From these cases four patients had further obstruction due to laryngeal myxedema. By performing endoscopic laryngeal surgeries and applying levothyroxine replacement therapy sufficiently wide glottic chink has been achieved in all the cases. According to the experience of the authors dyspnea caused by bilateral vocal cord paralysis after thyroidectomy needs complex, interdisciplinary therapeutic approach beside glottis widening operations.\nDocument [6]: Title: Congenital vocal cord paralysis. Abstract: Congenital stridor is rare. The most common presentation for congenital stridor is chronic loud breathing since birth. It is noticed in patients by the first 4 to 6 weeks of life. There are many causes of congenital stridor. Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of congenital stridor. Congenital vocal cord paralysis is the second most common cause of congenital stridor. Vocal cord paralysis in infants and children can be either congenital or acquired and either unilateral or bilateral. Although most commonly the paralysis is idiopathic, there are many causes of acquired vocal cord paralysis. Arnold-Chiari malformation is the most common congenital central nervous system abnormality resulting in vocal cord paralysis, and central nervous system abnormalities usually may cause bilateral vocal cord paralysis. In this article, we report 2 patients with idiopathic congenital vocal cord paralysis. One of them has the unilateral vocal cord paralysis, and the other, bilateral.\nDocument [7]: Title: [Bilateral vocal cord paralysis due to rheumatoid arthritis]. Abstract: Cricoarythenoid arthritis can be part of rheumatoid arthritis, which can present with laryngeal symptoms as in other systemic diseases. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis can developed with the progression of cricoarythenoid arthritis and can endanger the patient who suffers from dyspnea and eventually choking. Ankylosis and no mobility of the arythenoids, secondary to chronic inflammatory process in the cricoarythenoid joint, induce in the chronic phase bilateral vocal cord paralysis with symptoms such as stridor, horseness, dyspnea and also pain during speaking and swallowing in the acute phase. The treatment for cricoarythenoid arthritis with bilateral vocal cord paralysis include operations for improvement of breathing and voice. Tracheostomy gives an immediate solution for acute medical condition of dyspnea, resulting from the location of the vocal cords in paramedian or median position, due to their immobility. There are other operations aiming to produce adduction of the vocal cords and widen the glottic inlet and thereby improve the airway condition. The family physician needs to consider the damage and fixation of the vocal cord in patients with advanced arthritis. Patients who have rheumatic arthritis need an otolaryngologic follow-up and periodic laryngoscopic evaluation in order to prevent delayed diagnosis of bilateral vocal cord paralysis which endangers the patient's airway. It is recommended to be examined by an otolaryngologist and also to evaluate the vocal cords as part of the pre-operative evaluation of the anesthesiologist, as performed in the evaluation of the larynx in patients prior to thyroidectomy. This is a case study of a patient who had severe rheumatoid arthritis and developed cricoarythenoid arthritis and bilateral vocal cord paralysis presented with stridor and dyspnea and needed an immediate tracheostomy. Cricoarythenoid arthritis with bilateral vocal cord paralysis including treatments options are discussed.\nDocument [8]: Title: SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF VOCAL CORD PARALYSIS: THE NEED FOR CAREFUL PATIENT SELECTION. Abstract: Vocal cord paralysis is one of the challenging laryngeal clinical entities confronting the Laryngologist and indeed, the Phono-surgeon. The ability to maintain an effective balance between voice and airway function to ensure good quality of life requires expertise. This study is therefore designed to highlight our experience on surgical management of vocal cord paralysis.\nDocument [9]: Title: Vocal cord paralysis after surgery to the descending thoracic aorta via left posterolateral thoracotomy. Abstract: Vocal cord paralysis is one of the frequently encountered complications after aortic surgery. However, reports of vocal cord paralysis after aortic surgery have been limited. In a retrospective cohort study of vocal cord paralysis after aortic surgery at a general hospital, we sought factors related to its development after aortic surgery to the descending thoracic aorta via left posterolateral thoracotomy. We reviewed data for a total of 69 patients who, between 1989 and 1995, underwent aortic surgery to the descending thoracic aorta. We assessed factors associated with the development of vocal cord paralysis and postoperative complications. Postoperative vocal cord paralysis appeared in 19 patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed two risk factors for vocal cord paralysis: chronic dilatation of the aorta at the left subclavian artery (odds ratio = 8.67) and anastomosis proximal to the left subclavian artery (odds ratio = 17.7). The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly prolonged for patients with vocal cord paralysis. Certain surgical factors associated with left subclavian artery increase the risk of vocal cord paralysis after surgery on the descending thoracic aorta. Vocal cord paralysis after aortic surgery did not increase aspiration pneumonia but was associated with pulmonary complications.\nDocument [10]: Title: Congenital bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Abstract: Congenital upper airway obstruction is a relatively rare but important cause of major respiratory problems in the neonatal period. Vocal cord paralysis is the second most common cause of congenital airway obstruction presenting with neonatal stridor. It is often the reason for the failure of neonates to wean from the respiratory support. A retrospective analysis of medical record review was conducted. There were seven paediatric patients diagnosed with bilateral vocal fold paralysis in the past three years, of which five were recently diagnosed. All patients underwent flexible with/without rigid bronchoscopes to confirm the diagnosis. This case series highlight our experience in managing the problem of bilateral vocal cord paralysis in the paediatric population, with particular emphasis on their clinical presentations, associated complications and both upper and lower airway abnormalities. The management options and outcome of these patients will also be discussed.\nDocument [11]: Title: Bilateral vocal cord paralysis in a patient with Parkinson's disease. Abstract: Bilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients with Parkinson's disease is a life-threatening complication. The need for surgical treatment such as a tracheotomy or laser arytenoidectomy is determined by the severity of the patient's symptoms. A case of bilateral vocal cord paralysis in a patient with Parkinson's disease treated with an urgent tracheotomy is reported.\nDocument [12]: Title: Transient bilateral vocal cord paralysis after endotracheal intubation with double-lumen tube -A case report-. Abstract: Vocal cord paralysis is one of the most serious anesthetic complications related to endotracheal intubation. The practitioner should take extreme care, as bilateral vocal cord paralysis can obstruct the airway and lead to disastrous respiratory problems. There have been many papers on bilateral vocal cord paralysis after neck surgery, but reports on such a condition after lung surgery are very rare. We report a case of bilateral vocal cord paralysis detected after removal of a double-lumen endotracheal tube in a 67-year-old patient who underwent wedge resection by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. We also note that he recovered spontaneously without complications within a day.\nDocument [13]: Title: Laser arytenoidectomy and posterior cordotomy in a patient with bilateral vocal cord paralysis due to multiple system atrophy. Abstract: Bilateral vocal cord paralysis leading to stridor is a known but rare complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) and a recognised complication of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Tracheostomy is a commonly offered treatment, leading to substantial adaptations and lifestyle changes for the patient. Patients can struggle to manage a tracheostomy due to the tremor and bradykinesia associated with their parkinsonism. We report a case of bilateral vocal cord paralysis leading to significant stridor in a patient with atypical parkinsonism (probable MSA). To avoid tracheostomy, our patient underwent successful right-sided laser arytenoidectomy and posterior cordotomy as a day-case procedure. At follow-up, he had a weaker voice but complete recovery from the shortness of breath and stridor. He was very satisfied with the outcome. We conclude that, despite resulting in a weaker voice, this procedure offers an option to the patient that improves quality of life.\nDocument [14]: Title: [Upper airway obstruction with bilateral vocal cord paralysis secondary to ischemic stroke: report of two cases]. Abstract: We present herein two patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis that occurred during the subacute phase of brain infarction. Patients were a 73-year-old man and an 82-year-old woman who suffered from infarction of the basilar artery and the right middle cerebral artery, respectively. The former was diagnosed as atherothrombotic infarction, but the patient experienced repeated aggravation. The latter was diagnosed as cardioembolic infarction. After both patients took clopidogrel and warfarin for the secondary prevention of stroke, upper airway obstruction developed at Day 29 and Day 19, respectively. Vocal cords in Case 1 did not show any movement on laryngoscopy, and were fixed together nearly closed. In Case 2, vocal cords were again almost fixed together. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is a common complication of cervical operations, but is rare after ischemic stroke. As patients who have suffered from bilateral vocal cord paralysis are often facing death, we must be careful of wheezing with ischemic stroke.\nDocument [15]: Title: Bilateral Vocal Cord Abduction Paralysis after C1 Laminectomy in a Child with Type 1 Arnold Chiari Malformation. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Type 1 Arnold Chiari is a neurological malformation that may be associated with vocal cord paralysis in Children. In most cases, the vocal cord paralysis is related to protrusion of medulla and cerebellum in the foramen magnum, which led to compression on the vagus nerve.<b>Case report:</b> A 12-year-old child underwent suboccipital decompression and C1 laminectomy for a symptomatic type 1 Arnold Chiari malformation. After the surgery, patient reported severe dyspnea, aphonia, and dysphagia. The videolaryngostroboscopy and neurological examinations reported a postoperative bilateral vocal cord abduction paralysis due to bilateral IX and X cranial nerve paralyzes and a bilateral paralysis of the tongue.<b>Discussion:</b> The type 1 Arnold Chiari malformation clinical picture may present with unilateral or bilateral vocal cord paralysis, which may resolve with an adequate management of the disease. However, the neurosurgical decompression and C1 laminectomy may result in bilateral lesion of the IX, X, and XII cranial nerves, and related severe swallowing, aspiration and vocal cord disorders.<b>Conclusion:</b> We reported the first case of bilateral vocal cord abduction paralysis occurring post-neurosurgical decompression and C1 laminectomy in a child with type 1 Arnold Chiari malformation. This case highlights the importance of surgical steps of the procedure in front of the C1 vertebrae where there are IX, X, and XII cranial nerves.\nDocument [16]: Title: [Vocal cord paralysis associated with tracheal intubation: incidence, risk analysis, and classification of severity]. Abstract: Vocal cord paralysis after tracheal intubation is rare. It causes severe hoarseness and aspiration, and delays recovery and discharge. Arytenoid cartilage dislocation and recurrent nerve paralysis are main causes of vocal cord paralysis. Physical stimulation of the tracheal tube as well as patient and surgical characteristics also contribute. Vocal cord paralysis occurs in 1 (0.07%) of 1,500 general surgery patients and on the left side in 70% of cases. It is associated with surgery/anesthesia time (two-fold, 3-6 hours; 15-fold, over 6 hours), age (three-fold, over 50 years), and diabetes mellitus or hypertension (two-fold). Symptoms resolve in 2-3 months. In adult cardiovascular surgery, vocal cord paralysis occurs in 1 (0.7-2%) of 50-100 cardiac surgery patients and 1 (8.6-32%) of 3-10 thoracic aortic surgery patients. In pediatric cardiac surgery, vocal cord paralysis occurs in 1 (0.1-0.5%) of 200-1,000 patients. We classified the severity of vocal cord paralysis as I, severe hoarseness; II, aspiration or dysphagia; and III, bilateral vocal cord paralysis, aspiration pneumonia, or the need for tracheal re-intubation or tracheotomy. We discuss the importance of informed consent for the patient and family.\nDocument [17]: Title: Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy following anterior cervical surgery subsequent to contralateral apical lung radiotherapy. Abstract: Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy is a potential complication of the anterior approach for cervical surgery. It is a rare complication of radiotherapy to the neck. Only one case has been reported following radiotherapy apical lung cancer. It can result in unilateral vocal cord paralysis. We report a patient who demonstrated bilateral vocal cord paralysis immediately following right-sided anterior cervical surgery, with significant consequences, including aphonia, respiratory distress and subsequent takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was diagnosed with acute, (temporary) post-operative right recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, on the background of undetected and previously asymptomatic left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy following radiotherapy for left apical lung cancer. The possibility of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy should be considered in patients with previous apical lung cancer and/ or radiotherapy. Patents undergoing subsequent anterior cervical surgery should be considered for the appropriate precautions in the form of same-side surgery or pre-operative investigation for vocal cord paralysis.\nDocument [18]: Title: [Bilateral vocal cord paralysis with acute airway obstruction and urgent tracheotomy in a patient with an acute vertebrobasilar stroke]. Abstract: Vertebrobasilar stroke can be a diagnostic challenge. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is very rare as a manifestation of acute stroke, yet it is potentially life-threatening because of the possibility of acute airway obstruction. No cases of bilateral vocal cord paralysis have been reported as a presenting symptom of acute stroke of mixed central and peripheral neurological aetiology.\nDocument [19]: Title: [Clinical research of unilateral posterior glottic cleft dilatation in the treatment of bilateral vocal cord paralysis dyspnea]. Abstract: <b>Objective:</b>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of unilateral posterior glottic cleft dilatation with low-temperature plasma under the endoscope in the treatment of bilateral vocal cord paralysis dyspnea. <b>Methods:</b>Forty-one patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis were recruited, and they were all admitted to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from March 2014 to June 2019. Those 41 patients were all treated with low-temperature plasma to completely resect unilateral arytenoid cartilage and the posterior 1/3 of the ipsilateral vocal cord. Fiber laryngoscopy was performed before and after operation. The clinical efficacy of the operation was evaluated by the size of glottis cleta, the improvement rate of dyspnea, voice satisfaction, swallowing function, the tracheal cannula removal rate and postoperative complication rate. <b>Results:</b>Forty-one patients were followed up for 24-88 months. The rate of one-pass extubation was 88.57%&#65288;31/35&#65289;. The satisfaction rate of voice was 92.11%&#65288;35/38&#65289;. The recovery rate of swallowing function was 97.56%&#65288;40/41&#65289;. <b>Conclusion:</b>This study demonstrated that the application of low-temperature plasma in unilateral posterior glottic cleft dilatation could significantly improved the ventilation function of patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis, with a reliable curative effect and a high extubation rate. It is a safe, reliable, simple and minimally invasive treatment option for the treatment of bilateral vocal cord paralysis.\nDocument [20]: Title: Emergency endoscopic vocal cord lateralization as an alternative to tracheotomy for patients with bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis. Abstract: This study aimed at evaluating the results of emergent endoscopic permanent vocal cord lateralization instead of tracheotomy in patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis who were admitted to the emergency service. Retrospective analysis was done of 13 patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis admitted to emergency service with severe dyspnea. Patient information, paralysis etiology, operation times and follow-up data were reviewed. All 13 patients who underwent this procedure were females and the ages were ranging from 38 to 69 (average 52). Bilateral vocal cord paralysis was a result of thyroid surgery in all. Thyroid surgery was performed 8 months to 10 years (mean 41 months) before being admitted to the emergency service. The duration of procedure from intubation to closing skin incision ranged from 20 to 50 min (average 34 min). Patients were followed for a duration of 3 months to 10 years (average 24 months). In 12 of the patients adequate glottis chink was obtained and recovery from general anesthesia was uneventful without a need for tracheotomy. In one case, catheter placement was done with difficulty and a tracheotomy was performed as a temporary measure. Endoscopic vocal cord lateralization with submucosal cordectomy is a reliable alternative to tracheotomy even in emergency conditions for bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis. Adequate air can be obtained in majority of cases and long term patency is satisfactory.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents has increased globally over the past 2 decades. Metabolic syndrome, including obesity and overweight at a young age, increases the occurrence of T2DM. Studies in Indonesia have found that obese children and adolescents are more likely to have insulin resistance, a risk factor for T2DM. There are no data on the current incidence of T2DM in youth in Indonesia, but there has been a significant rise in the prevalence of overweight in adolescents. The diagnosis of T2DM in youth is similar to that in adults, with special consideration of when to test asymptomatic children. Management of T2DM in Indonesia follows the recommendations of the Indonesian Pediatric Society, which include lifestyle modifications, such as improving dietary habits and exercise, as well as appropriate medications. Metformin is the drug of choice for young T2DM patients; if marked hyperglycemia is present, basal insulin is given with metformin. Monitoring of T2DM is generally done through selfmonitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin.\nDocument [2]: Title: Childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abstract: Until recently, the majority of cases of diabetes mellitus among children and adolescents were immune-mediated type 1a diabetes. Obesity has led to a dramatic increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among children and adolescents over the past 2 decades. Obesity is strongly associated with insulin resistance, which, when coupled with relative insulin deficiency, leads to the development of overt T2DM. Children and adolescents with T2DM may experience the microvascular and macrovascular complications of this disease at younger ages than individuals who develop diabetes in adulthood, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden death; renal insufficiency and chronic renal failure; limb-threatening neuropathy and vasculopathy; and retinopathy leading to blindness. Health care professionals are advised to perform the appropriate screening in children at risk for T2DM, diagnose the condition as early as possible, and provide rigorous management of the disease.\nDocument [3]: Title: Impaired glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. Abstract: Diabetes mellitus in paediatric patients used to be almost exclusively type 1, but in recent years, case series as well as hospital-based and population-based studies indicated that the number of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has been increasing. This development is alarming since T2DM in youth is usually not an isolated condition, but accompanied by other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and low-grade inflammation. In adults, numerous studies provided detailed data on prevalence, incidence and risk factors for the development of T2DM, but for children and adolescents clinical and experimental data are still rather limited. This review provides an overview about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of T2DM in youth and about impaired glucose regulation as major risk factor for diabetes development with a special focus on the recent literature on clinical and lifestyle-related risk factors. Differences in incidence and prevalence across different populations indicate that ethnic background and genetic pre-disposition may be important risk determinants. In addition, epigenetic factors and foetal programming appear to confer additional risk before birth. Among the environmental and lifestyle-related risk factors there is evidence that obesity, hypercaloric diet, physical inactivity, socio-economic position (SEP), smoking, low-grade inflammation, psychosocial stress and sleeping patterns contribute to the risk for T2DM. However, the assessment of the relevance of risk factors and of incidence or prevalence estimates in youth is complicated by methodological issues that are also discussed.\nDocument [4]: Title: Is acanthosis nigricans a reliable indicator for risk of type 2 diabetes in obese children and adolescents? A systematic review. Abstract: Obesity and type 2 diabetes is becoming a major health problem affecting children and adolescents in the United States. This article reviews the current literature examining the association between the presence of acanthosis nigricans (AN) and risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in obese children and adolescents. Ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and emergence of obesity are contributing factors for development of hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance, and ensuing visible changes on skin which is known as the AN. The purpose of this review was to assess the validity of AN as an early indicator of T2DM. Nineteen articles that were published from 1994 to 2010 were included for this review and reported an association between AN, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. Nurses and advanced nurse practitioners working with children and adolescents have a tremendous role in identifying the risk factors, counseling, role modeling, and referring them to available community resources to promote healthy living. Early initiatives focusing on lifestyle changes may halt the progress, chronicity, and burden of T2DM in children and adolescents.\nDocument [5]: Title: Are frequency and severity of sleep-disordered breathing in obese children and youth with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus different? Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults. Data in children are limited. The aim was to study the frequency and severity of OSA and its association with cardiometabolic risk factors in obese children and adolescents with and without T2DM. In this prospective cross-sectional study, obese children and adolescents with and without T2DM underwent polysomnography and blood tests for fasting lipids, insulin, glucose, liver functions, and C-reactive protein. All participants completed a questionnaire on past and present sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Results were compared between T2DM and obese non-diabetic controls matched for body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) and also according to the glycemic status: T2DM, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and normal glycemic control. Eleven patients with T2DM (age 15.9 \u00b1 3.6 years) and 30 BMI-SDS matched non-diabetic subjects (age 12.7 \u00b1 3.0 years) were studied. Among the entire cohort, 45 % had a history of snoring, 26 % reported apneic episodes during sleep, and 65 % had daytime fatigue. There were no significant between-group differences in SDB history or abnormal polysomnographic results [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >5/h]. The percentage of subjects with AHI >5/h was 45.5 % in T2DM patients, 25 % in obese patients with IGT, and 18.2 % in obese patients without IGT, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). Plasma C-reactive protein levels were related to both glycemic status and OSA severity. The severity of OSA in obese children and adolescents is unrelated to the presence of diabetes. OSA may play a minor role in the development and progression of T2DM in children and adolescents. Further studies in larger cohorts are required.\nDocument [6]: Title: Statin Use and the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Children and Adolescents. Abstract: There is increasing evidence of an association between statin use and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults, yet this relationship has never been studied in children or adolescents and may have important implications for assessing risks and benefits of treatment in this population. We estimated the association between statin use and the risk of T2DM in children with and without a dyslipidemia diagnosis.\nDocument [7]: Title: Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents: a relatively new clinical problem within pediatric practice. Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, chronic metabolic disease, presents a heterogeneous etiology, with risk factors at the social level and behavioral, environmental, and genetic susceptibility. It is associated with serious complications, but the early diagnosis and initiation of therapy may prevent or delay the onset of long-term complications. In children and adolescents, it was observed in particular increasing the prevalence of T2DM along with obesity, which is associated with insulin resistance. Patient and family education for a young person with T2DM is very important and will focus on behavioral changes (diet and activity).\nDocument [8]: Title: Management of newly diagnosed type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents. Abstract: Over the past 3 decades, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased dramatically in North America, ushering in a variety of health problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which previously was not typically seen until much later in life. The rapid emergence of childhood T2DM poses challenges to many physicians who find themselves generally ill-equipped to treat adult diseases encountered in children. This clinical practice guideline was developed to provide evidence-based recommendations on managing 10- to 18-year-old patients in whom T2DM has been diagnosed. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a Subcommittee on Management of T2DM in Children and Adolescents with the support of the American Diabetes Association, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association). These groups collaborated to develop an evidence report that served as a major source of information for these practice guideline recommendations. The guideline emphasizes the use of management modalities that have been shown to affect clinical outcomes in this pediatric population. Recommendations are made for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM. The recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The clinical practice guideline underwent peer review before it was approved by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with T2DM, and its recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with T2DM. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated. The AAP acknowledges that some primary care clinicians may not be confident of their ability to successfully treat T2DM in a child because of the child's age, coexisting conditions, and/or other concerns. At any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made. If a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model in which the pediatrician partners with parents to ensure that all health needs are met.\nDocument [9]: Title: The worldwide epidemiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus--present and future perspectives. Abstract: Over the past three decades, the number of people with diabetes mellitus has more than doubled globally, making it one of the most important public health challenges to all nations. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes are increasingly observed among children, adolescents and younger adults. The causes of the epidemic of T2DM are embedded in a very complex group of genetic and epigenetic systems interacting within an equally complex societal framework that determines behavior and environmental influences. This complexity is reflected in the diverse topics discussed in this Review. In the past few years considerable emphasis has been placed on the effect of the intrauterine environment in the epidemic of T2DM, particularly in the early onset of T2DM and obesity. Prevention of T2DM is a 'whole-of-life' task and requires an integrated approach operating from the origin of the disease. Future research is necessary to better understand the potential role of remaining factors, such as genetic predisposition and maternal environment, to help shape prevention programs. The potential effect on global diabetes surveillance of using HbA(1c) rather than glucose values in the diagnosis of T2DM is also discussed.\nDocument [10]: Title: Diabetes complications in childhood and adolescent onset type 2 diabetes-a review. Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine disorders in children. Earlier, diabetes in children was almost exclusively type 1 diabetes. Recently, the scenario has changed and increasing numbers of children and adolescent T2DM are being diagnosed. As the epidemic of T2DM shifts to children and adolescents, there is an increased risk of development of micro and macrovascular complications. This could potentially affect the economy of the nation apart from posing a large burden to the individual and his or her family. Prevention and treatment are especially important, given the fact that onset at an early age increases the risk of developing micro and macrovascular complications due to increased duration of exposure to hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities. Diagnosing children and adolescents with T2DM early and instituting good control of all risk factors could yield good results in the prevention of long term complications of diabetes. This review focuses on the prevalence of complications of diabetes among children and adolescents with T2DM.\nDocument [11]: Title: Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and youth. Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which used to be a disease of adults is now seen commonly at an early age in children and adolescents. T2DM is now an important diagnostic consideration in children who present with signs and symptoms of diabetes. The emerging epidemic of obesity in children throughout the world and the resultant insulin resistance contributes to the increasing prevalence of T2DM in this population. The recommended treatment options include metformin and insulin. Optimal glycemic control is essential considering the lifelong nature of the disease and therefore, the increased risk of long term complications - both microvascular and macrovascular. This review article summarizes the classification, diagnosis, pathogenesis, management, complications and screening of T2DM in children, incorporating and contextualizing guidelines from various professional associations.\nDocument [12]: Title: Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents. Abstract: During the last two decades, there have been several reports of an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents, especially among those belonging to minority ethnic groups. This trend, which parallels the increases in prevalence and degree of pediatric obesity, has caused great concern, even though T2DM remains a relatively rare disease in children. Youth T2DM differs not only from type 1 diabetes in children, from which it is sometimes difficult to differentiate, but also from T2DM in adults, since it appears to be an aggressive disease with rapidly progressive &#946;-cell decline, high treatment failure rate, and accelerated development of complications. Despite the recent research, many aspects of youth T2DM still remain unknown, regarding both its pathophysiology and risk factor contribution, and its optimal management and prevention. Current management approaches include lifestyle changes, such as improved diet and increased physical activity, together with pharmacological interventions, including metformin, insulin, and the recently approved glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide. What is more important for everyone to realize though, from patients, families and physicians to schools, health services and policy-makers alike, is that T2DM is a largely preventable disease that will be addressed effectively only if its major contributor (<i>i.e.</i>, pediatric obesity) is confronted and prevented at every possible stage of life, from conception until adulthood. Therefore, relevant comprehensive, coordinated, and innovative strategies are urgently needed.\nDocument [13]: Title: Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents. Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Previously an adult onset disease, it is now being diagnosed more and more in childhood and adolescence. Lately, Asia has become the epicenter of this epidemic. Childhood T2DM is a new challenge for the pediatrician. Due to similarities in presentation, children may initially be misdiagnosed with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Most oral anti-diabetic agents have not been approved for use in adolescents, and there is a concern for safety of their use. Lifestyle intervention is difficult to conduct, and adherence to recommendations is lower in adolescents than in adults with T2DM. Higher incidence and early onset of co-morbidities, with lack of long term outcomes data make the management problematic. In many communities, due to a shortage of specialists, general practitioners will treat children with T2DM. Guidelines cited in this review are designed to help with the diagnostic process and management.\nDocument [14]: Title: Metabolic disorders in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents is increasing in incidence worldwide. It is the leading type of newly diagnosed diabetes in Taiwan among school children. T2DM is associated with metabolic syndrome in adults, so we tried to find out if these metabolic disorders are present in children.\nDocument [15]: Title: Hypertriglyceridemia in Diabetes Mellitus: Implications for Pediatric Care. Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is estimated that the risk of CVD in diabetes mellitus (DM) is 2 to 10 times higher than in the general population. Much of this increased risk is thought to be related to the development of an atherogenic lipid profile, in which hypertriglyceridemia is an essential component. Recent studies suggest that dyslipidemia may be present in children and adolescents with DM, particularly in T2DM and in association with poor control in T1DM. However, the role of hypertriglyceridemia in the development of future CVD in youth with DM is unclear, as data are scarce. In this review, we will evaluate the pathophysiology of atherogenic hypertriglyceridemia in DM, the evidence regarding an independent role of triglycerides in the development of CVD, and the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with DM, highlighting the potential relevance to children and the need for more data in children and adolescents to guide clinical practice.\nDocument [16]: Title: Pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus in youth: the evolving chameleon. Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents is an important Public Health problem against the backdrop of the epidemic of childhood obesity. The clinical presentation of T2DM in youth is heterogeneous from minimal symptomatology to diabetic ketoacidosis. The increasing rates of youth T2DM have paralleled the escalating rates of obesity, which is the major risk factor impacting insulin sensitivity. Additional risk factors include minority race, family history of diabetes mellitus, maternal diabetes during pregnancy, pubertal age group and conditions associated with insulin resistance (IR) - such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The pathophysiology of T2DM has been studied extensively in adults, and it is widely accepted that IR together with beta-cell failure are necessary for the development of clinical diabetes mellitus in adulthood. However, pathophysiologic studies in youth are limited and in some cases conflicting. Similar to adults, IR is a prerequisite, but beta-cell failure is necessary for progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and frank diabetes in youth. Even though rates of T2DM in youth are increasing, the overall prevalence remains low if compared with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, as youth with T1DM are becoming obese, the clinical distinction between T2DM and obese T1DM has become difficult, because of the overlapping clinical picture with evidence of islet cell autoimmunity in a significant proportion of clinically diagnosed youth with T2DM. The latter are most likely obese children with autoimmune T1DM who carry a misdiagnosis of T2DM. Further research is needed to probe the pathophysiological, immunological, and metabolic differences between these two groups in the hopes of assigning appropriate therapeutic regimens. These challenges combined with the evolving picture of youth T2DM and its future complications provide unending opportunities for acquisition of new knowledge in the field of childhood diabetes.\nDocument [17]: Title: Epidemiology of childhood diabetes mellitus in Japan. Abstract: The incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in Japan among those below 15 years of age is reportedly 1.5-2.5 per 100,000; however, population-based data have not been available in recent years. Although the incidence of T1DM in Japan is extremely low compared with that in Caucasians, the vast majority of Japanese children who are diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 10 years have T1DM. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in childhood is approximately 3.0 per 100,000, with the figure among junior high school children being 3-6 times higher than that among primary school children. The most common type of diabetes in children appears to shift from T1DM to T2DM with advancing age, especially after puberty. The mortality risk of patients with childhood-onset T1DM diagnosed between 1965 and 1979 is 12.9-fold higher than that of the general population. However, due to efforts aimed at improving medical care and ameliorating the effects of diabetes among children and adolescents, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) has declined markedly over the past 30 years. The progression of complications in T2DM appears to be more rapid than that in T1DM, primarily due to the number of drop-out cases. Therefore, appropriate education and treatment programs are necessary to protect against diabetic complications in the younger generation. The establishment of an ongoing population-based national T1DM and T2DM registry system is critical for identifying risk factors associated with diabetes and its complications.\nDocument [18]: Title: Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents: the new challenge. Abstract: The epidemic increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents is presenting enormous challenges to the medical profession. The combination of factors such as obesity, ethnicity, puberty, and genetic predisposition has contributed to the development of T2DM in younger ages. These factors affect the regulatory mechanism of insulin secretion, insulin action, and hepatic gluconeogenesis. In contrast to adults, children appear to have a shorter latency to disease, a more rapid development of symptoms, and an increased ketoacidosis. There are limited therapeutic options to prevent or manage T2DM in children. Although the role of diet and exercise (lifestyle intervention) has not been adequately evaluated in children, they will remain important adjuncts in the prevention and treatment of T2DM. Insulin and metformin are currently the only approved medications for the treatment of T2DM in children. Clinical trials involving other oral agents used in adults are currently being conducted to evaluate their safety and efficacy in children.\nDocument [19]: Title: Current Perspectives on Management of Type 2 Diabetes in Youth. Abstract: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents is on the rise, and the increase in prevalence of this disorder parallels the modern epidemic of childhood obesity worldwide. T2DM affects primarily post-pubertal adolescents from ethnic/racial minorities and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Youth with T2DM often have additional cardiovascular risk factors at diagnosis. T2DM in youth is more progressive in comparison to adult onset T2DM and shows lower rates of response to pharmacotherapy and more rapid development of diabetes-related complications. Lifestyle modifications and metformin are recommended as the first-line treatment for youth with T2DM in the absence of significant hyperglycemia. Assessment of pancreatic autoimmunity is recommended in all youth who appear to have T2DM. Pharmacotherapeutic options for youth with T2DM are limited at this time. Liraglutide, a GLP-1 agonist, was recently approved for T2DM in adolescents 10 years of age and older. Several clinical trials are currently underway with youth with T2DM with medications that are approved for T2DM in adults. Bariatric surgery is associated with excellent rates of remission of T2DM in adolescents with severe obesity and should be considered in selected adolescents.\nDocument [20]: Title: Dominant Western health care: type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abstract: Diabetes is a major public health problem with serious complications. In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that 18.2 million people in the United States had diabetes. One in every 400 to 500 adolescents is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and pediatric type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents an emerging public health concern. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) identified 337 children with T2DM through 2004. These children were mostly female and obese with a strong family history of T2DM. One patient's course of treatment for 1.5 years after initial presentation is described. Nineteen percent of the patients at CHOP were diagnosed with a neuropsychiatric illness before T2DM onset, further complicating their treatment. There is an imperative need for large-scale studies investigating the pathophysiology, treatment, and complications of T2DM in adolescents and youth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Veterans experiencing combat-related PTSD often refrain from seeking mental health services due to the stigma attached, which can lead to extreme and life-threatening consequences including depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Attaining a better understanding of coping mechanisms is important because it has the ability to help veterans better manage their stigma in the future and potentially help them survive PTSD and the stigma associated with it. Thus, the current study uses stigma management communication theory to uncover the ways in which veterans with PTSD communicatively manage their stigmatized identity. In-depth one-on-one interviews with United States veterans show that veterans with PTSD manage stigma using all six major strategies of stigma management communication. Some veterans managed stigma by blending contradictory strategies together. In addition, new stigma management communication strategies appeared. Not only do these results offer advancement for communication theory, but they could aid in the development of military training, military policy, mental health assessments, interventions, and destigmatizing campaigns.\nDocument [2]: Title: Understanding how Canadian healthcare providers have learned to identify co-occurring PTSD symptoms and dementia in Veterans. Abstract: WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Little is known about how PTSD and dementia in Veterans is identified by health care providers. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Healthcare providers identify those behavioural symptoms experienced by older people living with dementia that represent an unmet need associated with PTSD secondary to military service. Once healthcare providers recognize the presence of symptoms relevant to PTSD, they modify their care approach to include focused/tailored non-pharmacological care interventions that address environmental and situational variables that reflect military action. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Specialized education and training is needed to improve the identification of PTSD when existent with other co-occurring neurocognitive conditions such as delirium, dementia and depression. ABSTRACT: Introduction Co-occurring PTSD and dementia in Veterans can be difficult to distinguish from dementia-related responsive behaviours, which may result in inappropriate care management. Improved identification of PTSD and dementia is necessary to inform more appropriate and effective care for Veterans. Aim/Question The purpose of this study was to understand how Canadian healthcare providers have learned to identify the co-occurrence of PTSD symptoms in Veterans with dementia. Methods Eight semi-structured interviews employing the Critical Incident Technique were conducted with key informant healthcare providers who treat Veterans from across Canada. Framework analysis was used to code, sort and develop themes. Results Observed differences in Veterans with PTSD and dementia cued healthcare providers to seek our more information, leading to a new understanding of past trauma underlying the symptoms they observed. Healthcare providers then altered their usual care approaches to utilize trust-based and validation-oriented strategies resulting in more effective care management. Discussion Improvement in the identification of co-occurring PTSD and dementia in Veterans requires specialized education and training for healthcare providers. Implications for Practice Recognizing the complex needs of older Veterans with co-occurring PTSD and dementia is necessary for healthcare providers to implement more effective care for this population. Relevance Statement This paper provides mental health nurses with new understanding of co-occurring PTSD and dementia in Veterans. With an ageing Veteran population in Canada, mental health nurses need to be knowledgeable about the care for Veteran specific mental health needs.\nDocument [3]: Title: Complex PTSD among treatment-seeking veterans with PTSD. Abstract: <b>Background</b>: In the ICD-11 hierarchical classification structure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) are separate and distinct but also 'sibling' disorders, meaning that the diagnoses follow from the parent category of traumatic stress disorders. <b>Objective</b>: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of CPTSD in treatment-seeking war veterans with PTSD more than 20 years after the exposure to cumulative war-related trauma(s). The second aim was to examine if there was an association between demographic and psychosocial variables and CPTSD or PTSD. <b>Method</b>: A sample of 160 male war veterans with PTSD referred to the outpatient service of the PTSD Referral Centre at the Clinical Hospital Centre (CHC) Rijeka participated in a cross-sectional study. Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and participants completed validated self-report measures: The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ). <b>Results</b>: In total, 80.63% of the sample met criteria for a probable diagnosis of CPTSD. The study revealed that there was no significant difference in the length of deployment, in the intensity of the PTSD symptoms, types of trauma exposure and pharmacotherapeutic treatment between PTSD and CPTSD group. It was found that veterans with PTSD were more likely to be divorced and to participate in PTSD clubs. On the other hand, veterans with CPTSD were significantly more likely to have higher levels of functional impairment and comorbidity with general anxiety disorder (GAD) compared to the PTSD group. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study supports the proposition that a prolonged trauma of severe interpersonal intensity such as war is related to high rates of CPTSD among treatment-seeking veterans, years after the war. The distinction between PTSD and complex PTSD may help the selection of person-centred treatment interventions that would target specific mental health and functional problems in patients.\nDocument [4]: Title: A qualitative study of determinants of PTSD treatment initiation in veterans. Abstract: Although there are effective treatments for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many PTSD sufferers wait years to decades before seeking professional help, if they seek it at all. An understanding of factors affecting treatment initiation for PTSD can inform strategies to promote help-seeking. We conducted a qualitative study to identify determinants of PTSD treatment initiation among 44 U.S. military veterans from the Vietnam and Afghanistan/Iraq wars; half were and half were not receiving treatment. Participants described barriers to and facilitators of treatment initiation within themselves, the post-trauma socio-cultural environment, the health care and disability systems, and their social networks. Lack of knowledge about PTSD was a barrier that occurred at both the societal and individual levels. Another important barrier theme was the enduring effect of experiencing an invalidating socio-cultural environment following trauma exposure. In some cases, system and social network facilitation led to treatment initiation despite individual-level barriers, such as beliefs and values that conflicted with help-seeking. Our findings expand the dominant model of service utilization by explicit incorporation of factors outside the individual into a conceptual framework of PTSD treatment initiation. Finally, we offer suggestions regarding the direction of future research and the development of interventions to promote timely help-seeking for PTSD.\nDocument [5]: Title: Adjustment profiles of Yom Kippur war veterans seeking delayed help from the IDF. Abstract: The most common stress reactions following combat are post-traumatic stress reactions. These responses have a great impact on quality-of-life and can damage victims' personal, familial, and social functioning. However, of the people who develop PTSD, only a few request psychological help. The first aim of the research was, therefore, to examine the long-term adjustment patterns of Yom Kippur War veterans who sought help only after a period of more than 30 years. The second aim was to classify the participants according to a common symptom profile. The participant sample consisted of 195 Yom Kippur War veterans who went through a process of assessment and evaluation via intake interviews conducted between 2006 and 2012, when they came to the Combat Stress Reaction (CSR) unit. Data were collected from the participants' files. The findings indicated that, by the time they arrived at the CSR Unit, 90.8% of the participants were experiencing PTSD. The findings support the argument that delayed onset of PTSD without a background history of symptoms is rare, and indicate that most people who seek help report that their low-level symptoms intensified over the years until these symptoms developed into clinically meaningful PTSD.\nDocument [6]: Title: A Dynamic Model of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder for Military Personnel and Veterans. Abstract: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stands out as a major mental illness; however, little is known about effective policies for mitigating the problem. The importance and complexity of PTSD raise critical questions: What are the trends in the population of PTSD patients among military personnel and veterans in the postwar era? What policies can help mitigate PTSD? To address these questions, we developed a system dynamics simulation model of the population of military personnel and veterans affected by PTSD. The model includes both military personnel and veterans in a \"system of systems.\" This is a novel aspect of our model, since many policies implemented at the military level will potentially influence (and may have side effects on) veterans and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The model is first validated by replicating the historical data on PTSD prevalence among military personnel and veterans from 2000 to 2014 (datasets from the Department of Defense, the Institute of Medicine, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other sources). The model is then used for health policy analysis. Our results show that, in an optimistic scenario based on the status quo of deployment to intense/combat zones, estimated PTSD prevalence among veterans will be at least 10% during the next decade. The model postulates that during wars, resiliency-related policies are the most effective for decreasing PTSD. In a postwar period, current health policy interventions (e.g., screening and treatment) have marginal effects on mitigating the problem of PTSD, that is, the current screening and treatment policies must be revolutionized to have any noticeable effect. Furthermore, the simulation results show that it takes a long time, on the order of 40 years, to mitigate the psychiatric consequences of a war. Policy and financial implications of the findings are discussed.\nDocument [7]: Title: Aripiprazole in the management of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in returning Global War on Terrorism veterans. Abstract: The present study illustrates the potential use of aripiprazole as part of the management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in returning Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) veterans. Five consecutive cases of GWOT combat-related PTSD, managed in part with the atypical antipsychotic medication aripiprazole, are presented and discussed. In four of the five cases reported, the medication was well-tolerated and was effective in the management of sleep disturbances, such as nightmares and agitated behaviours during sleep, and was also helpful in the management of hyper-arousal. In one case, the veteran experienced a paradoxical excitation response to the medication. Aripiprazole, in conjunction with other medications or psychotherapeutic interventions, should be studied further for its potential role in the management of PTSD.\nDocument [8]: Title: [The Club of Croatian War Veterans treated for PTSD as a form of psychosocial rehabilitation]. Abstract: For the period after the war patients with complex disorders are specific. Their increased need for psychiatric protection stimulates people to organize additional, outpatient activities in the mental health area. The authors present their experiences of working in the Club of Croatian War veterans treated for PTSD (the PTSD Club) and the positive therapeutic effect of systematic work upon the principles of sociotherapeutic community, systematic family approach, and self-help. The PTSD club is one of possible problem solutions, and the right choice of how to organize and conduct preventive and rehabilitative programs for high-risk groups of patients.\nDocument [9]: Title: Prolonged exposure therapy for combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder: comparing outcomes for veterans of different wars. Abstract: There is significant support for exposure therapy as an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across a variety of populations, including veterans; however, there is little empirical information regarding how veterans of different war theaters respond to exposure therapy. Accordingly, questions remain regarding therapy effectiveness for treatment of PTSD for veterans of different eras. Such questions have important implications for the dissemination of evidence based treatments, treatment development, and policy. The current study compared treatment outcomes across 112 veterans of the Vietnam War, the first Persian Gulf War, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. All subjects were diagnosed with PTSD and enrolled in prolonged exposure (PE) treatment. Veterans from all three groups showed significant improvement in PTSD symptoms, with veterans from Vietnam and Afghanistan/Iraq responding similarly to treatment. Persian Gulf veterans did not respond to treatment at the same rate or to the same degree as veterans from the other two eras. Questions and issues regarding the effectiveness of evidence based treatment for veterans from different eras are discussed.\nDocument [10]: Title: Temperament, Character, and Subjective Well-Being in Croatian War Veterans Suffering From Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Abstract: Subjective well-being is decreased in war-affected populations. However, no previous research has investigated the role of temperament and character dimensions in life satisfaction among war veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study enrolled 148 Croatian male war veterans being treated for combat-related PTSD. The participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised. Two multivariate regression analyses with life satisfaction as a dependent variable and temperament and character dimensions, respectively, as predictor variables, were performed. Temperament dimensions harm avoidance and novelty seeking as well as character dimensions self-directedness and cooperativeness were unique predictors of life satisfaction, while controlling for the influence of depressive symptoms, education level, and employment status. Given the influence of personality dimensions on life satisfaction, the routine assessment of these dimensions might help to establish the individually tailored treatment among war veterans with PTSD.\nDocument [11]: Title: Long-term follow-up (32 Years) of PTSD in Israeli Yom Kippur War veterans. Abstract: The Yom Kippur War came as a major shock to the confidence and stability of the national psyche in Israel, and it may be suggested that the incidence of associated psychological trauma at least in war veterans may be more profound and long-standing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of PTSD in a naturalistic cohort of Yom Kippur veterans 32 years after the war managed for PTSD in a specialized unit during the war. Results indicated that of the 277 (20.9%) initial battle front-injured referred for evaluation who were diagnosed with PTSD, 32 years later only 19 war veterans were still suffering with PTSD (6.85% of the PTSD subpopulation or 1.43% of the original injured combat veteran cohort). Results from this long-term follow-up study indicate a low incidence of chronic symptomatology that may be accounted for by the nature of the initial care, follow-up, and subpopulation investigated.\nDocument [12]: Title: A pilot trial of telephone-based collaborative care management for PTSD among Iraq/Afghanistan war veterans. Abstract: Collaborative care and care management are cornerstones of Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) and have been shown to reduce depressive symptoms. Historically, the standard of Veterans Affairs (VA) collaborative care was referring patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to specialty care. Although referral to evidence-based specialty care is ideal, many veterans with PTSD do not receive such care. To address this issue and reduce barriers to care, VA currently recommends veterans with PTSD be offered treatment within PC-MHI as an alternative. The current project outlines a pilot implementation of an established telephone-based collaborative care model-Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions (TIDES)-adapted for Iraq/Afghanistan War veterans with PTSD symptoms (TIDES/PTSD) seen in a postdeployment primary care clinic.\nDocument [13]: Title: The Course and Correlates of Combat-Related PTSD in Australian Vietnam Veterans in the Three Decades After the War. Abstract: Australian male Vietnam veterans (N = 388) were assessed 22 and 36 years after their return to Australia using standardized diagnostic interviews, with added data from Army records and self-report questionnaires. Among veterans who ever had posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 50.3% had a current diagnosis at the second assessment; of those who had a current diagnosis at Wave 1, 46.9% were also current at Wave 2. Late onset occurred for 19.0% of veterans, of whom 60.8% were current at Wave 2. Multivariate analysis compared veterans with no history of PTSD (n = 231) with veterans who had ever had PTSD (n = 157) to assess risk factors for PTSD incidence; and veterans with a history, but not current PTSD (n = 78) with veterans who had current PTSD at the second assessment (n = 79) to assess risk factors for failure to remit. Incidence was associated with lower education, shorter Army training predeployment, higher combat, excess drinking, and help-seeking after return to Australia. Prevalence was associated with having a father who saw combat in World War II, being injured in battle, having a lower intelligence test score, experiencing higher combat, and having a diagnosis of phobia at the first assessment. Only combat was common to incidence and prevalence.\nDocument [14]: Title: Aging, Depression, and Wisdom: A Pilot Study of Life-Review Intervention and PTSD Treatment With Two Groups of Vietnam Veterans. Abstract: Vietnam War veterans are a sometimes overlooked subgroup of the aging baby boomer generation. Forty years after the war ended, war veterans still seek out VA or Vet Center counselors to assist with traumatic stress symptoms. However, there currently are no specific age-related protocols for treating older war veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), nor have established PTSD interventions incorporated gerontology content for these older trauma survivors. This pilot study juxtaposed life review within regular PTSD group counseling for 12 Vietnam veterans at a community-based Vet Center using a partial crossover design. The Life Review and Experiencing Form (LREF) structured the delivery of the life review component. T-tests and repeated measures ANOVA were used to examine depression and self-assessed wisdom outcomes using measures previously tested with older adults. Findings suggest that life review prior to PTSD group therapy has clinical benefits for reducing symptoms of depression and increasing self-assessed wisdom. The study illuminates the possible relationship of traumatic stress symptom effects on the natural reminiscing process for older veterans and provides insights into methods for more age-appropriate treatment for trauma survivors participating in Vet Center and VA programs nationwide.\nDocument [15]: Title: Diagnosis and treatment of PTSD-related compulsive checking behaviors in veterans of the Iraq war: the influence of military context on the expression of PTSD symptoms. Abstract: This case study presents an overview of the conceptualization and treatment of two veterans of the Iraq War who presented for combat-related treatment at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. In addition to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms of reexperiencing, arousal, and avoidance, the veterans exhibited compulsive checking behaviors that appear to be influenced by theater-specific combat duties and traumatic events. These cases represent what the authors believe to be an increasingly common expression of PTSD in veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Both veterans were treated with prolonged exposure therapy, which includes imaginal and in vivo exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli, processing of traumatic events, and self-assessment of anxiety. Treatment also included in vivo exposure with response prevention techniques borrowed from the literature on obsessive-compulsive disorder to address compulsive checking behaviors within the ecological context of each patient's symptom presentation. Measures related to PTSD and depression were obtained before, during, and after treatment. Treatment was associated with significant declines in symptom severity and improved functioning for both veterans. The unique nature of the conflict in the Middle East represents role challenges for soldiers that affect symptom presentation. Variations in symptom presentation can in turn complicate efforts to identify and appropriately address PTSD-related health concerns in this population. Thus, clinicians and researchers must remain cognizant of how theater-specific duties influence the manifestation and treatment of PTSD in order to provide optimal care to a new generation of veterans.\nDocument [16]: Title: A pilot study of seeking safety therapy with OEF/OIF veterans. Abstract: PTSD and substance use disorder (SUD) are highly prevalent among veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom; OEF/OIF). Seeking Safety (SS) is a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for co-occurring PTSD/SUD. This pilot study with fourteen male OEF/OIF veterans suggests that SS may help to reduce alcohol use, PTSD, and depression in some participants at clinically significant levels, even when providing less than half of the full model. We emphasize several SS features as especially helpful: the case management component to help engage clients in further mental health and SUD care, offering PTSD as an entry point, and emphasis on community resources. Issues particular to veterans include reintegration to civilian life and supporting their connection with other veterans.\nDocument [17]: Title: Why are Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans seeking PTSD disability compensation at unprecedented rates? Abstract: The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced historically low rates of fatalities, injuries, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among U.S. combatants. Yet they have also produced historically unprecedented rates of PTSD disability compensation seeking from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The purpose of this article is to consider hypotheses that might potentially resolve this paradox, including high rates of PTSD, delayed onset PTSD, malingered PTSD, and economic variables.\nDocument [18]: Title: A primary care perspective of posttraumatic stress disorder for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Abstract: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major mental disorder associated with significant morbidity, psychosocial impairment, and disability. The diagnosis of PTSD can be missed in a primary care setting, as patients frequently present with somatic complaints or depression and are often reluctant to discuss their traumatic experiences. As recent studies of veterans returning from the Gulf War and the Iraqi War suggest high rates of PTSD, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospitals are gearing up to face this challenge. It is important to screen these veterans for symptoms of PTSD and make an appropriate referral if required. In this article, we attempt to review PTSD with a special focus on the VA population. In addition to discussing the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment options for PTSD, we also suggest screening questions for both combat-related and military sexual trauma-related PTSD.\nDocument [19]: Title: Chapter 5 mantram repetition: an evidence-based complementary practice for military personnel and veterans in the 21st century. Abstract: Today in the digital age, with our advances in modern technology and communication, there are additional stressors for our military personnel and Veterans. Constant dangers exist both on and off the battlefield, unlike prior wars that had clearly-defined war zones. In addition, medical advances have assisted in saving the lives of many more gravely injured troops than ever previously possible. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan come to an end, large numbers of service men and women are returning home with multiple injuries. This group of Veterans has significantly higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury than ever before reported. Although existing PTSD therapies have been found to be highly effective for many Veterans, there is a substantial minority unsatisfactorily treated. Mantram repetition, an innovative, complementary, evidence-based treatment, is proving to be successful for these new Veterans. When used regularly it helps with \"road rage, impatience, anger, frustration, and being out of control.\" A mantram is a brief, sacred word or phrase that embodies divine power or the greatest positive energy one can imagine (Easwaran, 2008a). Mantram repetition is a simple, quick, personal, portable, and private complementary practice that may be used as an adjunct to current treatments for PTSD. Growing research evidence supports mantram repetition's value for dissemination and adoption in the 21st century. This chapter summarizes Mantram Program research conducted from 2003 to 2014. It describes the health-related benefits of the Mantram Program in various populations. The current research focuses on benefits for managing psychological distress and promoting quality of life in Veterans. Future areas for research are suggested.\nDocument [20]: Title: Military Sexual Trauma As a Risk Factor for Treatment Non-Response from an Online, Self-Management Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Treatment for Women Veterans. Abstract: Women veterans are exposed to high rates of trauma, including military sexual trauma (MST), and face unique barriers to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment. Telehealth interventions that are tailored to women veterans' unique lived experiences may improve treatment engagement and outcomes. It is important to ascertain how beneficial new telehealth interventions are in the context of different patient characteristics and trauma types, particularly for lower-intensity telehealth interventions (e.g., web-based programs or apps). This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial conducted in a sample of 102 women veterans examines predictors of treatment response to a self-management, telehealth intervention for PTSD: Delivery of Self Training and Education for Stressful Situations-Women Veterans (DESTRESS-WV). In the trial, women veterans with PTSD received either an online cognitive behavioral intervention with phone coaching, or phone monitoring alone. We examined associations between baseline patient characteristics (demographics, trauma types, and clinical symptoms) and treatment outcome at post-treatment, 3&#8201;months, and 6&#8201;months, focusing on the association between treatment outcome and MST. Our primary outcomes were changes in PTSD (PTSD Symptom Checklist, Version 5, PCL-5) and depression (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-8) in the full sample, adjusting for treatment condition. Women veterans who identified MST as the primary trauma for which they were seeking PTSD treatment experienced a nearly nine-point lesser improvement on the PCL-5 than those seeking PTSD treatment for other trauma types (e.g., childhood abuse, combat trauma; <i>p</i>&#8201;=&#8201;.0073). Similar patterns were found for depression symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between trauma type and treatment outcomes within the context of a self-management, telehealth treatment for PTSD. While the study was not powered to examine differential treatment response for patient subgroups, our exploratory findings suggest that gaps remain in providing effective PTSD care for women veterans who experienced MST.<b>Trial registration</b>: The trial and analysis plan were preregistered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02917447).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

How Do I Get Back to My Regular Activities? Abstract: You do not have to play tennis to get tennis elbow-a very common problem for people who do lots of repetitive movements of the wrist, forearm and elbow, such as carpentry, painting or racquet sports. Most people with tennis elbow feel pain on the outside of their elbow and upper forearm. Experts in managing elbow pain developed a guideline for rehabilitation clinicians to use to help you understand more about tennis elbow. Here, we explain what the guidelines say about how to diagnose tennis elbow (sometimes called lateral elbow pain or lateral elbow tendinopathy), the specific treatments your physical therapist might offer you to help manage pain and improve the mobility of your elbow, and the types of exercises you could do to strengthen the muscles in your wrist and forearm.\nDocument [2]: Title: Persistent Tennis Elbow Symptoms Have Little Prognostic Value: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Abstract: Tennis elbow is a common painful enthesopathy of the lateral elbow that limits upper limb function and frequently results in lost time at work. Surgeons often recommend surgery if symptoms persist despite nonsurgical management, but operations for tennis elbow are inconsistent in their efficacy, and what we know about those operations often derives from observational studies that assume the condition does not continue to improve over time. This assumption is largely untested, and it may not be true; meta-analyzing results from the control arms of tennis elbow studies can help us to evaluate this premise, but to our knowledge, this has not been done.\nDocument [3]: Title: Functional Outcome of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Intra-lesional Injection for Tennis Elbow - A Prospective Cohort Study. Abstract: Introduction Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is an autologous human plasma preparation with a higher platelet concentration. Injection of PRP were, found to be effective in treating tendinopathy and arthritis. A few studies only focused in using PRP injection in patients with tennis elbow. This study was conducted to access the functional outcome of PRP injection in tennis elbow patients. Methodology A prospective study was done from June 2020 to June 2021, at R. L. Jalappa Hospital, Kolar, India among 80 individuals diagnosed with tennis elbow. All individuals aged between 18 to 65 years of either gender and the pain symptoms not subsided with oral analgesics or physiotherapy were included in this study. We analysed all the patients with a MAYO elbow performance score and Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) during the follow-up period. Results In total, 80 individuals participated in our study, of which the mean age of the participants was 45.54. There is statistical significance in the difference of means of pain score obtained using both VAS and MAYO score at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. There is high significant positive correlation of age with the pain scores at 12th week and 24th week after the procedure. Conclusion In tennis elbow patients, PRP injection shows an effective reduction in pain according to VAS and MAYO score and especially, younger age patients have shown more benefit in terms of pain reduction with PRP treatment.\nDocument [4]: Title: Patient satisfaction after open release of common extensor origin in treating resistant tennis elbow. Abstract: Resistant tennis elbow has been an enigma for orthopaedic surgeons. Several treatment methods have been suggested. We assessed the outcome of open release in the management of resistant tennis elbows, based on patient satisfaction. Eighteen patients (24 elbows) who underwent open release were followed up. Surgery was done after a mean waiting time of 23 months from the onset of pain and an unsuccessful trial of non operative methods. Post operatively they were followed up for clinical improvement and complications. They were later contacted to assess effectiveness from the surgery. In fifteen patients (83%) excellent pain relief was achieved and they regained normal use of the limb. One patient (6%) had moderate improvement and two (11%) gained minimal benefit with persistent symptoms. There were no complications in this series. We conclude that despite recent advances, this time tested procedure still remains an excellent option when non-operative management has failed.\nDocument [5]: Title: Pulled elbow in children. Abstract: <b>Question</b> Our practice is seeing children with relatively minor injuries to their elbows, with a history of \"swinging\" them when their hands are being held to cross the road. Nothing is usually found on a physical examination. I know that this is likely a \"pulled elbow.\" Can we manage this in the clinic setting rather than sending the family to the emergency department? What would be the best course of action in the clinic setting?<b>Answer</b> Pulled elbow, also called <i>nursemaid's elbow</i>, is a radial head subluxation caused by axial traction or a sudden pull of the extended pronated arm, and it is a very common phenomenon. The practice of swinging children while holding their hands should be abandoned. In the case of pulled elbow, the child usually avoids moving the affected arm, holding it close to his or her body, without considerable pain, and no obvious swelling or deformity can be seen. While a fracture should be excluded, pulled elbow can usually be identified based on this presentation. The reduction procedure can easily be done in the office setting, with an 80% success rate and no complications. The hyperpronation maneuver (holding the elbow at 90&#176; and then firmly pronating the wrist) to reduce pulled elbow has been found to be better than a supination-flexion maneuver (holding the elbow at 90&#176; with one hand, supinating and flexing the elbow rapidly with the other) and should be exercised first. When 2 trials of reduction are unsuccessful, the child's arm should be splinted and the family should be sent for further evaluation.\nDocument [6]: Title: Tennis elbow: blending basic science with clinical practice. Abstract: Tennis elbow defines a condition of varying degrees of pain or point tenderness on or near the lateral epicondyle. It is prevalent in individuals who perform a combination of forceful and repetitive activities including athletes and wheelchair users. The most common work-related disorder at the elbow is tennis elbow. Histopathological findings indicate that tennis elbow is a degenerative condition, called tendinosis, of the common extensor tendon, with the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon more commonly implicated as the primary location of tendinosis. Despite the absence of inflammation, patients with tennis elbow still present with pain. Neurochemicals including glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide have been identified in patients with chronic tennis elbow and in animal models of tendinopathy. Their presence provides an alternative mechanism for pain mediation. Based on what is known about tissue changes within chronic tendinopathies, implications for therapy including examination and interventions are discussed.\nDocument [7]: Title: Extensor origin vascularity related to pain in patients with Tennis elbow. Abstract: Tennis elbow, extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) tendinosis, is a condition with unknown etiology and pathogenesis, known to be difficult to treat. The pain mechanisms have not been fully clarified, but involvement of a neurogenic inflammation mediated via the neuropeptide Substance-P (SP), has been suggested. In this investigation, grey-scale ultrasonography (US) and colour Doppler (CD) was used to examine the common extensor origin in 17 patients with the diagnose Tennis elbow in altogether 22 elbows, and in 11 controls with 22 pain-free elbows. In 21/22 elbows with chronic pain from the extensor origin, but only in 2/22 pain-free elbows, vascularity was demonstrated in the extensor origin. After US and CD-guided injection of a local anaesthetic, targeting the area with vessels, the patients were pain-free during extensor-loading activity. The area with vascularity found in the extensor origin seems to be related to pain. Most likely, the findings correspond with the vasculo-neural in growth that has been demonstrated in the chronic painful Achilles tendon, and possibly have implications for treatment.\nDocument [8]: Title: Evaluation of elbow pain in adults. Abstract: The elbow is a complex joint designed to withstand a wide range of dynamic exertional forces. The location and quality of elbow pain can generally localize the injury to one of the four anatomic regions: anterior, medial, lateral, or posterior. The history should include questions about the onset of pain, what the patient was doing when the pain started, and the type and frequency of athletic and occupational activities. Lateral and medial epicondylitis are two of the more common diagnoses and often occur as a result of occupational activities. Patients have pain and tenderness over the affected tendinous insertion that are accentuated with specific movements. If lateral and medial epicondylitis treatments are unsuccessful, ulnar neuropathy and radial tunnel syndrome should be considered. Ulnar collateral ligament injuries occur in athletes participating in sports that involve overhead throwing. Biceps tendinopathy is a relatively common source of pain in the anterior elbow; history often includes repeated elbow flexion with forearm supination and pronation. Olecranon bursitis is a common cause of posterior elbow pain and swelling. It can be septic or aseptic, and is diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and bursal fluid analysis if necessary. Plain radiography is the initial choice for the evaluation of acute injuries and is best for showing bony injuries, soft tissue swelling, and joint effusions. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality for chronic elbow pain. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for an inexpensive dynamic evaluation of commonly injured structures.\nDocument [9]: Title: Sclerosing polidocanol injections in chronic painful tennis elbow-promising results in a pilot study. Abstract: Sclerosing polidocanol injections targeting the area with neovessels (vascularity) have been demonstrated to give promising clinical results in patients with chronic painful Achilles and patellar tendinosis. Recently, we demonstrated vascularity in the extensor origin in patients with chronic painful tennis elbow, but not in controls with pain-free elbows. In this pilot study, 11 patients (four men and seven women, mean age 46 years) with the diagnosis of tennis elbow in altogether 13 elbows, were included. All patients had a long duration of pain symptoms (mean 23 months), and ultrasonography (US) + colour Doppler (CD) examination showed structural tendon changes with hypo-echoic areas, and a vascularity, corresponding to the painful area in the extensor origin. All patients were treated with US- and CD-guided injections of the sclerosing substance polidocanol, targeting the area with vascularity. At 8-month follow-up after treatment, there was a good clinical result in 11/13 elbows. Extensor origin pain during wrist loading activities (recorded on a VAS-scale) was significantly reduced (mean VAS from 75 to 34; P < 0.003), and maximal grip strength was significantly increased (from 29 to 40 kg; P < 0.025). Our findings indicate that one treatment with sclerosing polidocanol injections, targeting the area with vascularity in the extensor origin, has a potential to reduce the tendon pain and increase grip strength, in patients with chronic painful tennis elbow.\nDocument [10]: Title: A Review of Physiotherapy Techniques Used in the Treatment of Tennis Elbow. Abstract: Tennis elbow, a common musculoskeletal disorder also known as lateral epicondylitis, causes pain and tenderness on the outside of the elbow. Although it is frequently linked to repetitive motions, such as those in racquet sports, it can affect people in a variety of occupations and activities. Tennis elbow can be treated conservatively with physiotherapy, which focuses on pain management, functional recovery, and recurrence prevention. The goal of this review is to give a thorough overview of the physiotherapy methods used to treat tennis elbow. In order to determine the most effective treatment options, it is crucial to comprehend the pathophysiology and etiology of tennis elbow from the outset of the study. The assessment and diagnosis of tennis elbow are next covered, emphasizing the importance of physiotherapists in correctly diagnosing the ailment and distinguishing it from other musculoskeletal problems that are comparable to it. This study primarily focuses on the numerous physiotherapy therapies for tennis elbow, which may include but are not limited to, and the section examines the use of manual treatments to treat pain and enhance joint function, including joint mobilizations, soft tissue massage, and myofascial release. Exercise rehabilitation covers the value of tailored workouts to bolster the weak muscles and enhance the elbow joint's biomechanics. Numerous workout regimens are covered, such as eccentric training and progressive resistance exercises, as well as modalities. Therapeutic agents frequently make use of modalities such as ultrasound, laser therapy, and cryotherapy. It may also make use of complementary therapeutic agents such as taping and bracing. In summary, this in-depth analysis highlights the crucial role that physical therapy plays in the treatment of tennis elbow. It seeks to give practitioners a useful tool for enhancing the care and results of patients with this common and crippling ailment by summarizing the most recent research and best practices in physiotherapy approaches.\nDocument [11]: Title: Ultrasound-Guided Injection of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma for Refractory Lateral Epicondylitis of Humerus: Case Series. Abstract: Refractory lateral epicondylitis (RLE) is a tendinopathy of the elbow with less effective conservation treatment. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a new treatment option for RLE because of its repair-promoting effect on tissues. Although evidence demonstrates the efficacy of PRP in treating tendinopathies, the therapeutic utility of ultrasound-guided PRP injection for RLE is unknown. Here, we report two cases of RLE treated with PRP. The first patient was a 78-year-old man who received an unknown dose of local glucocorticoid injection at the local community clinic in June 2016. His pain recurred after exertion. The second patient was a 54-year-old woman who received a glucocorticoid injection (0.5 mL of compound betamethasone and 1.5 mL of 0.9% normal saline) in October 2020. Her pain could not be relieved. A physician diagnosed patients with RLE based on their medical history, symptoms, and clinical signs. The doctor injected PRP (the first patient in November 2020, the second in March 2021) under ultrasound guidance into the patient's attachment point of the extensor tendon at the lateral humeral epicondyle. The doctor evaluated the effectiveness of the treatment by ultrasonography, visual analogue scale, and the patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation. After four weeks of treatment, the pain was relieved, and functions continued to improve in the following three months. Moreover, the ultrasonography showed that the damaged tendons were repaired. Together, we demonstrate that ultrasound-guided PRP injection could considerably relieve pain, improve elbow joint functions in patients with RLE, and provide visible evidence that PRP repairs tendon damage.\nDocument [12]: Title: Long term results in refractory tennis elbow using autologous blood. Abstract: Tennis elbow (TE) is one of the commonest myotendinosis. Different treatment options are available and autologous blood injection has emerged as the one of the acceptable modalities of treatment. Long term studies over a larger group of patients are however lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate these patients on longer durations. One-hundred and twenty patients of TE, who failed to respond to conventional treatment including local steroid injections were taken up for this prospective study over the period from year 2005 to 2011 and were followed up for the minimum of 3 years (range 3-9 years). Two mL of autologous blood was taken from the ipsilateral limb and injected into the lateral epicondyle. The effectiveness of the procedure was assessed by Pain Rating Sscale and Nirschl Staging, which was monitored before the procedure, at first week, monthly for first three months, at 6 months and then 3 monthly for first year, six monthly for next 2 years and then yearly. Statistical analysis was done and a P value of <0.05 was taken as significant. The patients (76 females and 44 males) were evaluated after procedure. The mean age group was 40.67\u00b18.21. The mean follow up was 5.7\u00b11.72 (range 3 to 9 years). The mean pain score and Nirschl stage before the procedure was 3.3\u00b10.9 and 6.2\u00b10.82 respectively. At final follow up the pain score and Nirschl were 1.1\u00b10.9 and 1.5\u00b10.91 respectively. Autologous blood injection was found to be one of the modalities for treatment of TE. Being cheap, available and easy method of treatment, it should be considered as a treatment modality before opting for the surgery. Universal guidelines for the management of tennis elbow should be made as there is lot of controversy regarding the treatment.\nDocument [13]: Title: The immediate effects of orthoses on pain in people with lateral epicondylalgia. Abstract: Objective. Tennis elbow is a common cause of upper limb dysfunction and a primary reason for pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of three commonly used orthoses on pain severity. An elbow band, an elbow sleeve, and a wrist splint were assessed for their ability to reduce the level of reported pain. Method. A crossover randomized controlled trial was used. The orthoses were worn in a randomized order, and all participants were required to complete a control trial for which they wore a placebo orthosis. 52 participants with lateral epicondylalgia were recruited, and the level of pain at their elbow was recorded using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Results. The reported pain for all orthoses was lower than that of the placebo (P < 0.05). Pain reduction was significantly greater with a counterforce elbow band or a counterforce elbow sleeve compared to a wrist splint (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between a counterforce elbow band and a counterforce elbow sleeve (P = 0.23). Conclusion. All the types of orthoses studied showed an immediate improvement on pain severity in people with lateral epicondylalgia. The counterforce elbow orthoses (elbow band and elbow sleeve) presented the greatest improvement, suggesting that either of them can be used as a first treatment choice to alleviate the pain in people with tennis elbow.\nDocument [14]: Title: Adaptation and transcultural translation into Spanish of the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire. Abstract: The purpose of this study was to perform the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire to Spanish language and evaluate its reliability and validity. The translation and cultural adaptation into Spanish was done in accordance with the published guidelines. One-hundred fifty Spanish-speaking patients with unilateral chronic lateral epicondylalgia competed the questionnaire. Test-retest reliability was established by the intraclass correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was established with Cronbach's \u03b1. To establish convergent validity, we used the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire using the Spearman's correlation coefficient. Error estimation in the measurements was calculated with the standard error of measurement. Our results showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .96) and high test-retest reliability (intraclass coefficient = .9; .89-.94; P < .001). The Spearman's correlation coefficient (r = .765; P < .001) showed a good relationship between the Spanish version of the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire. The standard error of measurement (11.9%) showed little variability of measurements. In conclusion, the Spanish version of the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation Questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool that can be used to assess lateral epicondylalgia in Spanish-speaking individuals in order to implement the best treatment and reduce time with pain and disability.\nDocument [15]: Title: A comparative study of the efficacy of ultrasonics and extracorporeal shock wave in the treatment of tennis elbow: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Abstract: Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis is a common source of pain among craftsmen. Although it cannot be completely resolved, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and ultrasonics (US) have been found to be effective for tennis elbow as highlighted in previously published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reviews. However, the efficacy of these two therapies in treating tennis elbow is unknown. This meta-analysis compares the effectiveness of ESWT and US in relieving pain and restoring the functions of tennis elbow following tendinopathy.\nDocument [16]: Title: Comparative Efficacy of Local Steroid and Therapeutic Ultrasound for Quicker Functional Improvement in Tennis Elbow. Abstract: Lateral epicondylitis or Tennis elbow is very common repetitive stress injury or cumulative trauma disorder among active professionals and tennis players. Local steroid injection can provide quick functional improvement as sought by most of the patients. Therapeutic ultrasound and eccentric exercises can also improve the function. This study was carried out to see the comparative efficacy of these two modalities of treatments in terms of quicker functional improvement and this randomized interventional clinical trial was carried out in a private rehabilitation hospital in Dhaka. Patients attended the authors private chamber from January 2013 to December 2013 with clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow were included. Eighty adult patients diagnosed as lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow were randomly divided into two groups. Group A received local steroid injection (triamcinolone acetate) and group B received therapeutic ultrasound for two weeks. Both the groups received eccentric exercises and advised to avoid provocative activities like twisting and lifting activities. Pain, tenderness and functional improvements were measured in traditional methods like visual analogue scale (VAS) and tenderness grade 0 to 4. Data were analyzed by SPSS. Most of the patients were female. None of them were tennis player. Younger housewives were common sufferer. Almost all patients in group A had very little or no pain or tenderness and no difficulty in lifting object at one week and two weeks. VAS was 13.62\u00b16.503 and 4.15\u00b15.517 respectively. Group B patients had mild improvement of pain and function at one week and moderate improvement at two weeks. VAS was 52.57\u00b17.80 and 25.57\u00b15.392 respectively. Similarly tenderness' were markedly improved in Group A at one and two weeks. They were 0.68\u00b10.616 and 0.02\u00b10.405 respectively for Group A and 1.60\u00b10.553 and 1.14\u00b10.335 respectively for Group B. Results were statistically significant in both groups at the end of two weeks. Local corticosteroid injections at extensor origin in tennis elbow patients are found to have better relief of pain and tenderness and quicker functional improvement than therapeutic ultrasound treatment. None of the patients were followed up for long term efficacy in either group.\nDocument [17]: Title: Debridement of extensors and drilling of the lateral epicondyle for tennis elbow: a retrospective follow-up study. Abstract: Twenty-one patients treated for tennis elbow with debridement of the extensors, without repair of the affected tendons, and with decortication by drilling of the lateral epicondyle were reviewed retrospectively after a mean follow-up of 15 months (range, 11-33 months). The early postoperative period was characterized by a painful and slow recovery. At latest follow-up, 17 patients (81%) had a satisfactory outcome with no or only mild pain. Of the patients, 20 (95%) felt that they were better or much better compared with preoperatively. There were 2 complications: 1 hematoma that was aspirated and 1 temporary frozen shoulder. Debridement of the extensors and drilling of the lateral epicondyle relieved pain and restored function in the majority of the patients. However, recovery was slow and was never found to be immediate as described in other series of tennis elbow procedures where the extensors were simply released and the lateral epicondyle was not decorticated.\nDocument [18]: Title: Percutaneous tennis elbow release under local anaesthesia. Abstract: When the non-operative treatment of tennis elbow fails to improve the symptoms a surgical procedure can be performed. Many different techniques are available. The percutaneous release of the common extensor origin was first presented by Loose at a meeting in 1962. Despite the simplicity of the operation and its effectiveness in relieving pain with minimal scarring this procedure is still not widely accepted. This study presents the long-term results of percutaneous tennis elbow release in patients when conservative measures including local steroid injections have failed to relieve the symptoms.\nDocument [19]: Title: [About the problem of radial tunnel syndrome or \"where does the tennis elbow end and where does the radial tunnel syndrome begin?\"]. Abstract: Tennis elbow or epicondylitis lateralis humeri is a commonly seen pain-syndrome. Radial tunnel syndrome is generally assumed to be a rare nerve compression syndrome. This study intents to demonstrate that tennis elbow is the most common manifestation of radial tunnel syndrome or in other words, tennis elbow is nothing else but radial tunnel syndrome. In patients with tennis elbow one will always find the ramus profundus n. radialis compressed by the arcade of Frohse. The author is convinced that following the carpal tunnel syndrome, the radial tunnel syndrome is the second most common nerve compression in upper extremity.\nDocument [20]: Title: A Newly Designed Tennis Elbow Orthosis With a Traditional Tennis Elbow Strap in Patients With Lateral Epicondylitis. Abstract: Lateral epicondylitis is a common cause of pain and upper limb dysfunction. The use of counterforce straps for treatment of lateral epicondylitis is widespread. This kind of orthosis can be modified to have a greater effect on relieving pain by reducing tension on the origin of the extensor pronator muscles.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Cardiac emergencies in pregnancy and the postpartum period are rare but often life-threatening. An emergency physician's differential diagnosis for chest pain in the peripartum patient often includes serious etiologies such as pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction (MI). A lesser-known but important consideration on the differential for MI is that of a spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). SCAD is defined as an intramural hematoma within the coronary artery that compresses the true lumen. Expansion by increased pressures may lead to subsequent myocardial ischemia and infarction. This condition is the most common cause of pregnancy-associated MI and is reported as the cause of MI in 24% to 35% of all women younger than 50 years. This condition is predominately seen in young healthy females with no traditional risk factors for coronary artery or cardiac disease, and typically in the postpartum period. SCAD in the peripartum period is defined as pregnancy-associated spontaneous coronary artery dissection (PASCAD). Abnormal ECG changes, elevated troponins, and regional wall motional abnormalities on echocardiography are all diagnostic findings of SCAD, which can be ultimately confirmed with coronary angiography. Failure to immediately address this condition can lead to acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and death. Thrombolytic treatment may be harmful and is not recommended, and percutaneous coronary intervention can result in the iatrogenic propagation of further coronary dissection. As a result, the management for suspected SCAD involves emphasis on urgent transfer and urgent coronary artery angiography to determine appropriate treatment modalities.\nDocument [2]: Title: Clomiphene Associated Inferior STEMI in a Young Female due to Right Coronary Artery Dissection. Abstract: Nonatherosclerotic spontaneous coronary artery dissection (NA-SCAD) is an uncommon cause of myocardial infarction. It most commonly affects females in the perimenopausal age. NA-SCAD has been associated with many predisposing factors including pregnancy and hormonal therapy for both contraception and ovulation induction. The presented case is a previously healthy 41-year-old woman diagnosed with inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction due to right descending coronary artery dissection associated with recent use of clomiphene monotherapy for ovulation induction (a previously fertile woman), which was not previously reported. <i>Learning Objectives</i>. Emergency physicians (EPs) should be aware about NA-SCAD as a cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) especially in perimenopausal women even with no risk factors. NA-SCAD occurs more commonly in the postpartum period and in females following hormonal therapy. Here, clomiphene monotherapy was reported as a possible contributing factor to NA-SCAD. Guidelines for NA-SCAD management are not up to date, and EPs should avoid some interference before the final diagnosis of the cause of myocardial infarction.\nDocument [3]: Title: A Case of an Elderly Patient With Recurrent Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an underdiagnosed cause of myocardial infarction (MI), and its prevalence among women is increasing. Epidemiological information indicates that SCAD is responsible for one-third of MI cases in women of reproductive age. Little information is described on SCAD in elderly patients. The patient in the case presented here was an 81-year-old woman with a history of SCAD who presented with oppressive thoracic chest pain associated with electrical changes that derailed into ventricular fibrillation. Coronary angiography confirmed a SCAD recurrence, and conservative medical treatment was established. Different pathophysiological pathways have been proposed for SCAD extension or recurrence. Nonetheless, there is yet much to be discovered about this disease and its presentation in different age groups.\nDocument [4]: Title: Premenopausal woman with acute myocardial infarction caused by spontaneous coronary artery dissection and potential association with coronary vasospasm. Abstract: A 45-year-old premenopausal woman presented with acute myocardial infarction (MI). An intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed that her distal right coronary artery was occluded by spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). She did not have any specific condition related to SCAD. At follow-up cardiac catheterization, an acetylcholine provocation test was applied to examine the etiology of SCAD, and definitive coronary vasospasm was induced with chest symptoms and significant electrocardiographic change. A Ca-channel blocker was administered and since then chest pain has subsequently so far been relieved. The current case suggests the significance of the IVUS in detecting etiology of MI in younger patients and the potential association between SCAD and coronary vasospasm.\nDocument [5]: Title: Syncope with spontaneous coronary artery dissection in an elderly woman. Abstract: Diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is challenging because of its rarity and uncertain etiology. It frequently occurs in young women during pregnancy and in the postpartum period, and rarely found in elder women with no history of cardiovascular disease or coronary risk factors. In this article we report a case of SCAD in a 75-year-old woman without traditional cardiovascular risk factors who presented with syncope and mild chest discomfort. There were no abnormal electrocardiographic changes and no elevated cardiac enzymes were detected. Computed tomography of brain revealed nothing abnormal. Coronary artery disease was suspected. Coronary angiogram revealed dissection in the middle left circumflex artery. The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and was free of symptoms at 6-month follow-up. Our report suggests that emergency coronary angiography is indicated if syncope caused by coronary artery disease is suspected.\nDocument [6]: Title: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a woman undergoing pseudomenopause therapy with leuprorelin: A case report. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome. SCAD frequently affects women, and may be associated with pregnancy and the peripartum period. Therefore, female sex hormones are thought to play a pathogenetic role. Although pseudomenopause therapy may alter female sex hormone levels similar to those during pregnancy, there are no reported cases of SCAD associated with pseudomenopause therapy. We report the case of a 48-year-old woman who developed SCAD while undergoing pseudomenopause therapy with leuprorelin. This case suggests an association between SCAD and pseudomenopause therapy with leuprorelin. &lt;<b>Learning objective:</b> Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). SCAD frequently affects women and is thought to be associated with female sex hormones. Here, we report a case of SCAD in a patient who was undergoing pseudomenopause therapy with leuprorelin to treat uterine fibroids. Young or middle-aged women who present with symptoms suggestive of ACS should be asked about not only pregnancy and menstrual history, but also therapies altering female sex hormones.&gt;.\nDocument [7]: Title: A successful emergency management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection and review of the literature. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare and lethal myocardial ischemic event, which usually causes acute coronary syndrome and sudden death. Emergency management of SCAD includes medical treatment, percutaneous coronary interventions, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Here, we report 1 case of 37-year-old young woman who was found to have a mid-distal SCAD of the left anterior descending artery, taking conservative management decision. In another case of a 50-year-old woman who was found to have a proximal-middle spiral SCAD of the right coronary artery, she underwent coronary angioplasty. After 6 months later at follow-up, 2 patients remained stable without symptom and in recovery of the left ventricular function; angiogram showed the SCAD healed.\nDocument [8]: Title: A woman complicated by sudden cardiac arrest owing to spontaneous coronary artery dissection after stillbirth. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is the most important cause of acute coronary syndrome in pregnant women. Pregnancy-associated SCAD frequently occurs in the third trimester or postpartum period. However, little is known regarding the relationship between the occurrence of SCAD and stillbirth. We describe here a 41-year-old woman complicated by sudden cardiac arrest owing to SCAD in the distal segment of the right coronary artery 13 days after stillbirth. After contacting emergency medical services, she was resuscitated by an automated external defibrillator because the initial electrocardiographic waveform was ventricular fibrillation. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the diagnosis of SCAD was confirmed by coronary angiography and intracoronary imaging, including intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography. The patient was managed with conservative medical therapy because the culprit lesion was present in the distal segment of the right coronary artery and coronary blood flow was preserved. No major adverse cardiovascular events, including recurrent ventricular arrhythmia, were observed during hospitalization. Our findings indicate that pregnancy-associated SCAD leading to sudden cardiac arrest may occur in the postpartum period, even after stillbirth. Intravascular imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnosing SCAD. &lt;<b>Learning objective:</b> Pregnancy-associated spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a relatively rare but well-known cause of acute coronary syndrome in pregnant or postpartum women. However, whether the risk of pregnancy-associated SCAD in the postpartum period is different between normal birth and stillbirth remains unknown. Pregnancy-associated SCAD leading to sudden cardiac arrest owing to acute myocardial ischemia may occur in postpartum women, regardless of fetal survival.&gt;.\nDocument [9]: Title: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of ramus intermedius in an elderly woman. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of myocardial ischemia commonly seen in younger patients, particularly women. Patients often present similar to those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS); however, they often are missing the classic risk factors that are typically associated with coronary artery disease. Differentiating between SCAD and ACS is vital as they are managed differently with up to 80% of SCAD being managed conservatively. We present a case of 61-year-old woman with no previous cardiac history presenting with chest pain and was found to have spontaneous coronary artery dissection on coronary angiography.\nDocument [10]: Title: Postpartum dissection of the left main coronary artery. Abstract: Peripartum coronary artery dissection is rare, but it is an increasingly recognized risk to women of childbearing age. Literature reviews reveal that about 80% of the population with spontaneous coronary artery dissections (SCAD) are female, and approximately 25-33% of cases occurred while the woman was pregnant or in the peripartum phase. Most cases have presented within 2 weeks of delivery. The left anterior descending is the most commonly affected vessel. The etiology is poorly understood, but many reports suggest that SCAD occurs as a result of protease release secondary to an eosinophilic vasculitis resulting in vessel lysis. Many investigators have examined the correlation between peripartum SCAD and estrogen levels; however, case studies have shown conflicting results regarding estrogen levels as the putative causative factor. Optimal treatment remains controversial. Presently, stenting appears to be best employed in the patients who have single-vessel dissection not involving the left main coronary artery (LMCA). Surgical revascularization via coronary artery bypass graft remains the optimal therapy in patients whose dissection involves the LMCA, in patients with concurrent multivessel dissection, and in patients with disease refractory to medical management. It is important to consider coronary artery dissection in the differential of any young woman who presents with signs or symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome, particularly if she is peripartum. Furthermore, once suspected, it is imperative that a definitive diagnostic study, that is, coronary angiography, be completed prior to the initiation of treatment whenever possible.\nDocument [11]: Title: [Peripartum spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a case report]. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) accounts approximately for 0.2% of cases of acute coronary syndrome. It is defined \"spontaneous\" in absence of any coronary wall damage. This disease affects primarily young women in good health, with no risk factors for coronary artery disease, especially during the postpartum period. Since the clinical presentation varies widely from no symptoms to typical angina and sudden cardiac death, SCAD incidence is underestimated.A 40-year-old woman, in the 8th week after delivery, was admitted to our emergency department because of acute chest pain, and a diagnosis of inferior and posterior non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction was made. Emergency coronary angiography showed a small SCAD of the distal segment of a little marginal branch. Because of the small dimension of the dissection, optimal medical therapy was started. However, two days later, symptoms recurred and the ECG showed an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was therefore transferred to the cath lab and coronary angiography showed extensive dissection of the left anterior descending coronary artery with good angiographic result. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed and three drug-eluting stents were implanted.No retrospective studies or randomized clinical trials are available to guide the best treatment option in patients with SCAD, because of the wide variety of clinical presentation and the rarity of the pathology. Early and correct diagnosis of SCAD is key for adequate management. First, the site and precise quantification of lesion severity should be assessed with multiple angiographic projections. Intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography can provide additional information about the entry point of the lesion. Hemodynamic status and extension of the myocardium at risk should be also evaluated to determine the best therapeutic strategy. Since the presence of SCAD may be associated with aneurysm formation and dissections of other arteries, screening of the arterial tree may be useful, especially of the supra-aortic trunks and splanchnic circulation.\nDocument [12]: Title: Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection in Relation to Physical and Emotional Stress: A Retrospective Study in 4 Arab Gulf Countries. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death. The triggers for SCAD often do not include traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. The most commonly reported triggers are extreme physical or emotional stress. The current study compared in-hospital and follow-up events in patients with SCAD with and without reported stress. Data from 83 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SCAD were collected retrospectively from 30 centers in 4 Arab Gulf countries (KSA, UAE, Kuwait, and Bahrain) from January 2011 to December 2017. In-hospital myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, death, ICD placement, dissection extension) and follow-up (MI, de novo SCAD, death, spontaneous superior mesenteric artery dissection) events were compared between those with and without reported stress. Emotional and physical stress was defined as new or unusually intense stress, within 1 week of their initial hospitalization. The median age of patients in the study was 44 (37-55) years. Foty-two (51%) were women. Stress (emotional, physical, and combined) was reported in 49 (59%) of all patients. Sixty-two percent of women with SCAD reported stress, and 51 % of men with SCAD reported stress. Men more commonly reported physical and combined stress. Women more commonly reported emotional stress (P < 0.001). The presence or absence of reported stress did not impact on overall adverse cardiovascular events (P = 0.8). In-hospital and follow-up events were comparable in patients with SCAD in the presence or absence of reported stress as a trigger.\nDocument [13]: Title: Pregnancy-associated spontaneous coronary artery dissection: impact of medical treatment. Case report and systematic review. Abstract: We report on a 22- year-old woman with postpartum dissection of the left anterior descending artery and the intermediate branch. The patient was treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel, and betablocker only. Coronary angiography performed 20 months later revealed complete resolution of the dissection sites. The patient's cardiovascular risk factors included mild smoking and high total cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, which showed a marked fall after pregnancy without pharmacological cholesterol-modifying therapy raising the question whether pregnancy-related hypercholesterolemia contributed to the pathogenesis of pregnancy-associated spontaneous coronary artery dissection (P-SCAD). In a systematic review of the literature, 16 women [median age 34 (31-36.5) years] with P-SCAD and angiographic follow-up were identified. The majority (69%) of P-SCAD cases occurred postpartum [median time after delivery: 13 (7-21) days]. In 10/16 (63%) patients medical treatment including betablocker and antiplatelet therapy was given leading to complete resolution of the dissection in 5 of them (31% of all patients) at follow-up, whereas in the other 5 patients the dissections were persisting or even progressive. Of the medically treated patients, 80% were free of symptoms suggestive for ischemia at follow-up. In 5/16 patients percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed as first-line therapy. Three patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, which was performed primarily in one patient, and secondarily in two patients with persisting dissections and ongoing ischemic symptoms after previous medical treatment or PCI without stenting, respectively. In conclusion, medical treatment including ASA, clopidogrel and betablocker therapy results in an excellent clinical and angiographic result in approximately one third of patients with P-SCAD.\nDocument [14]: Title: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection as the first presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Abstract: A 33-year-old woman with no premorbidities presented to us with chest pain and worsening dyspnoea since 1 week. Systemic examination was suggestive of acute pulmonary oedema and preliminary investigations revealed evolved anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was stabilised and taken up for angiography which revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the same. Further investigation into the cause for the SCAD came strongly positive for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She had no prior symptoms suggestive of SLE and the SCAD was its very first clinical manifestation.\nDocument [15]: Title: A Complex Case of Pregnancy-related Left Main Stem Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a less common cause of acute coronary syndrome. Pregnancy-related SCAD is uncommon, but often presents with a more severe phenotype. This report describes a 30-year-old woman with an anterior ST elevation MI, presenting 1 day postpartum. Left main stem (LMS) SCAD with extensive intramural haematoma (IMH) and resultant LMS occlusion was confirmed by angiography and intravascular imaging. Given the extent of disease, the patient underwent emergency cardiac surgery. Coronary flow was initially improved by decompressing the IMH using cutting balloons. The coronary wires were successfully left <i>in situ</i> during transfer in an effort to both maintain flow and allow the surgeon to identify true LMS. Ideally, SCAD can be managed conservatively given the risk of intervention worsening IMH, and hence myocardial ischaemia/MI. However, emergency revascularisation is indicated in cases of persistent ischaemia. This case demonstrates percutaneous therapies to bridge towards and help with subsequent surgical revascularisation.\nDocument [16]: Title: A case of a young, healthy woman with spontaneous coronary artery dissection associated with oral contraceptive use: Long-term residual dissection of the coronary artery. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome, typically affecting young, healthy women, particularly during the peripartum period. Oral contraceptive use is also recognized as a risk factor for SCAD. In the present report, we describe a case of a young woman with an anterior wall myocardial infarction caused by SCAD of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The event was probably associated with the patient's oral contraceptive use. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and she did not experience any recurrent chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Although the coronary angiography revealed good LAD flow and no symptoms after 6 months, cardiac computed tomography and intravascular ultrasound revealed that LAD dissection was still present. We continued to closely follow-up the patient without initiating any additional intervention, and the patient has had no cardiac event for up to 4 years of follow-up. &lt;<b>Learning objective:</b> We aimed to present a case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection, with a long-term residual dissection. Coronary computed tomography aided the diagnosis of the residual dissection, which was not detected by coronary angiography.&gt;.\nDocument [17]: Title: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection associated with fibromuscular dysplasia. Abstract: This case presentation concerns a woman known to have fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) who presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The coronary angiogram was considered to be normal. However, as spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has a close association with FMD, subsequent meticulous review of the angiogram revealed a dissection within the circumflex coronary artery. SCAD causes 10% of ACS seen in women under 55 years of age. Both FMD and SCAD are underdiagnosed and SCAD may be overlooked or misdiagnosed on coronary angiography. The recommended management of SCAD differs from that of the usual presentations of ACS. For this reason, one should be alert to the possibility of SCAD when confronted by ACS in a younger woman, especially when she is known to have FMD.\nDocument [18]: Title: Rare case of asymptomatic spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Abstract: We present a case of a 46-year-old woman who presented to the emergency room after a syncopal episode. Most of her initial workup did not lead to any diagnosis. However, the transthoracic echocardiogram showed new onset left ventricular dysfunction. Further, cardiac evaluation showed a chronic coronary artery dissection in the proximal left anterior descending artery. Syncope was related to vasovagal event but rapid plasma reagin being positive led to the question of whether the coronary artery dissection was secondary to vasculitic manifestation of prior syphilis infection. More research is needed to answer this question and to find such an association. &lt;<b>Learning objective:</b> Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare disease of young adults that can present acutely as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with chest pain, as malignant ventricular arrhythmia, and even as sudden cardiac death. Our report is focused on evaluation and management of SCAD, more importantly to consider SCAD as a differential diagnosis in ACS in young patients, especially females. Our review also stresses the need for further research toward development of consensus on management of such patients.&gt;.\nDocument [19]: Title: Complete healing of spontaneous coronary artery dissection extending from the left main trunk to the left anterior descending and the left circumflex artery. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is defined as a spontaneous separation of the coronary artery wall that is not iatrogenic or related to trauma and usually affects young women. We describe a 65-year-old woman who presented with SCAD extending from the left main trunk involving the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery was performed to treat the dissection. Coronary angiography performed 3 months later, showed complete angiographic healing. A conservative management strategy is known to be associated with spontaneous angiographic healing in patients with SCAD who are hemodynamically stable. Healthcare providers should consider SCAD among the differential diagnoses in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, particularly in women. Further studies are needed to establish an optimal management strategy for SCAD. &lt;<b>Learning objective:</b> Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) might be a cause of acute coronary syndrome not only in younger but also in older women. Even if the area of the dissection is broad, healing can be expected in future. Therefore, it is important to select between conservative and invasive therapy such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft including selection of graft, i.e. saphenous vein graft and radial arteries, and internal mammalian arteries.&gt;.\nDocument [20]: Title: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: case series with extended follow up. Abstract: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is atherosclerotic or non-atherosclerotic in origin. Eosinophilic infiltrate is identified in coronary artery adventitia in non-atherosclerotic SCAD. We postulate that a systemic inflammatory state causes SCAD in younger women who do not have significant coronary artery disease risk factors. We report a case series of 13 patients presenting with SCAD from ages 26-48 with follow up from 1 month to 13 years. Most patients did not have conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). Approximately 50% of the patients developed recurrent dissection within the first 2 weeks of an index event, but < 25% were symptomatic during follow up. All patients were alive at follow up. Systemic inflammatory state was observed in 80% of patients who developed early recurrent dissection. SCAD should be strongly suspected in younger women presenting with acute coronary syndrome without CAD risk factors. Coronary dissection may recur within first 2 weeks, but patients have good long-term survival without new episodes of dissection. Broad rheumatologic and connective tissue disease work-up should be considered in young females presenting with SCAD.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Spontaneous regression of herniated lumbar discs was reported occasionally. The mechanisms proposed for regression of disc herniation are still incomplete. This paper describes and discusses a case of spontaneous regression of herniated lumbar discs with a new disc protrusion in the adjacent level. A 41-year-old man was admitted with radiating pain and numbness in the left lower extremity with a left posterolateral disc extrusion at L5-S1 level. He was admitted to hospital with low back pain due to disc herniation caudally immigrating at L4-5 level three years ago. He refused the surgical intervention that was offered and was treated conservatively at that time. He had no neurological deficit and a history of spontaneous regression of the extruded lumbar disc; so, a conservative therapy, including bed rest, physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and analgesics, was advised. In conclusion, herniated lumbar disc fragments may regress spontaneously. Reports are prone to advise conservative treatment for extruded or sequestrated lumbar disc herniations. However, these patients should be followed up closely; new herniation at adjacent/different level may occur. Furthermore, it is important to know which herniated disk should be removed and which should be treated conservatively, because disc herniation may cause serious complications as muscle weakness and cauda equine syndrome.\nDocument [2]: Title: Intradural migration of a sequestrated lumbar disc fragment masquerading as a spinal intradural tumor. Abstract: Intervertebral intradural lumbar disc herniation (ILDH) is a quite rare pathology, and isolated intradural lumbar disc herniation is even more rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may not be able to reveal ILDHs, especially if MRI findings show an intact lumbar disc annulus and posterior longitudinal ligament. Here, we present an exceedingly rare case of an isolated IDLH that we initially misidentified as a spinal intradural tumor, in a 54-year-old man hospitalized with a 2-month history of back pain and right sciatica. Neurologic examination revealed a positive straight leg raise test on the right side, but he presented no other sensory, motor, or sphincter disturbances. A gadolinium-enhanced MRI revealed what we believed to be an intradural extramedullary tumor compressing the cauda equina leftward in the thecal sac, at the L2 vertebral level. The patient underwent total L2 laminectomy, and we extirpated the intradural mass under microscopic guidance. Histologic examination of the mass revealed a degenerated nucleus pulposus.\nDocument [3]: Title: A Case of Postoperative Recurrent Lumbar Disc Herniation Conservatively Treated with Novel Intradiscal Condoliase Injection. Abstract: Although postoperative recurrent lumbar disc herniation (rec-LDH) is uncommon, it is a challenging situation that requires revision surgery when conservative treatment fails. Recently, an agent inducing chemical dissolution of the nucleus pulposus using condoliase has been approved as a novel intradiscal treatment for LDH. To date, no evidence has been reported regarding its effectiveness in the treatment of postoperative rec-LDH. A 25-year-old man with a history of LDH in L4/5, who underwent transforaminal full endoscopic lumbar discectomy when he was 17 years old, complained of severe pain radiating to his left leg since 1 month. The straight leg-raising test was limited to 25\u00b0 on the left side. Lumbar T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed intracanal, left-sided transligamentous disc herniation at L4/5 with high-signal intensity. Because the conservative treatment with oral analgesics and selective left L5 nerve root block failed, the patient requested intradiscal condoliase injection instead of revision surgery. There were no adverse events reported after the condoliase treatment, and the pain radiating to the left leg improved within 2 weeks. A lumbar MRI performed 2 months after treatment revealed that the disc herniation had significantly decreased in size. The straight leg-raising test examined 3 months after treatment was negative. In this case, the disc herniation was of the transligamentous type and showed a high-signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI which could be suitably treated by condoliase injection therapy. This case report is the first to suggest that intradiscal condoliase injection could be a useful and novel conservative treatment option to treat postoperative rec-LDH.\nDocument [4]: Title: Lower thoracic disc herniation mimicking lower lumbar disk disease: A case report. Abstract: Thoracic disk herniation comprises 0.15% of all disk herniation and has various and confusing manifestations. Among them, radicular pain down the leg could be the rarest presentation, especially if it is the only complaint. On the other hand, finding the relationship between clinical and paraclinical needs require high index of suspension and it is demanding. A 34-year-old patient, who had a history of intermittent back pain, with lower thoracic disk herniation presented by acute leg sciatica-like pain, is reported. He suffered 3 weeks of acute back pain prior to admission, which radiated down to buttock and leg, with a vague left abdominal pain, whose clinical examination indicated a distal lumbar problem. MRI showed T-12 L-1 disk herniation. Lower thoracic disc herniation can compress lumbosacral roots immediately after exiting from cord thickening in the lower thoracic area, so they can incite lower lumbar radiculopathy and cause discordance between MRI findings and clinical presentation, suggesting a lumbar problem, and this can lead to delayed diagnosis. However, the acute pain was completely improved after open discectomy.\nDocument [5]: Title: Regression of lumbar disc herniation with non-surgical treatment: a case report. Abstract: To date, only a few reports have described the regression of lumbar disc herniation, which may be because of a failure to follow up patients treated conservatively. We report a case of a 25-year-old man who presented with a 2-month history of pain and soreness owing to lumbar disc herniation. He was managed conservatively, and his presenting symptoms and scoliosis gradually decreased over approximately 5 months. Two years later, he returned unexpectedly and was advised to undergo magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed regression of the disc herniation; the patient also confirmed that the pain had not recurred. After 8 months, he underwent repeat magnetic resonance imaging, and the findings pertaining to disc herniation were normal. Our findings suggest that previous cases should be retrospectively studied to establish a prediction model for the outcomes of conservative treatment in patients with lumbar disc herniation. We also emphasize the significance of selecting suitable patients for conservative treatment to obtain the best therapeutic outcomes. The CARE guidelines have been followed in the reporting of this case.\nDocument [6]: Title: Ganglioneuroma of Spinal Nerve Root: A Rare Case Mimicking Herniated Lumbar Disc and Lumbar Radiculopathy. Abstract: Ganglioneuromas are rare benign tumors arising from neuroepithelial cells. Even more rarely they involve lumbar spinal nerve roots. We report a 34-year-old male patient who presented with typical lumbar radiculopathy. He had low back pain radiating to the right lower leg with numbness. His MRI revealed a herniated disc at L5-S1 compressing the right nerve root. Surgery was planned for microdiscectomy and nerve root decompression. Right L5 hemilaminotomy was performed and the nerve root was identified. Surprisingly the nerve root was markedly inflamed and there was no obvious disc tissue herniation. Considering it to be a spinal nerve root tumor, the dura of the nerve root was opened and nerve root mass exposed. Subtotal resection was performed. Biopsy showed Ganglioneuroma. The main purpose of this article is to report such a rare case and also to review the literature.\nDocument [7]: Title: The sensitivity and specificity of the Slump and the Straight Leg Raising tests in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Abstract: An accurate and specific diagnosis prevents the recurrences of low back pain and chronic spinal pain. The physical examination is the most useful tool to diagnosis. The examiner must aim to determine the exact tissue that pain arises from to make the specific diagnosis. Lumbar disc herniation is 1 disease that physical examination, symptoms, and findings on imaging technique do not always correlate with each other. The Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test has been used as the primary test to diagnosis lumbar disc herniations and found to have high correlation with findings on operation since its sensitivity is high in only disc herniations leading to root compression that may eventually need operation. More sensitive test, like the Slump, might be used in herniations in which the SLR is negative. The Slump test is really a variant of the SLR and the Las\u00e8gue's tests performed in the seated position and is a progressive series of maneuvers designed to place the sciatic nerve roots under increasing tension. At each step in the procedure, the patient informs the examiner what is being felt and whether radicular pain is produced. As a result, the Slump test applies traction to the nerve roots by incorporating spinal and hip joint flexion into the leg raising and would warn the examiner of the presence of nerve root compression when there is a negative SLR test.\nDocument [8]: Title: Spontaneous regression of a large sequestered lumbar disc herniation: a case report and literature review. Abstract: Lumbar disc herniation is a common disorder in adults that is accompanied by lower back and radicular pain. A 32-year-old man visited our clinic with 1-week history of persistent lower back pain and weakness in his right big toe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his lumbar spine revealed herniated discs at L3/L4, L5/S1 and L4/L5, where a right-sided intraspinal mass lesion deep to the L4 vertebral body was causing compression of the nerve root. The patient underwent conservative treatment and reported no symptoms referrable to his back or leg 4 months later. Follow-up MRI showed no herniation of the nucleus pulposus at the L4/L5 level or lesion deep to the vertebral body of L4, whereas no changes had occurred to the status of the herniated L3/L4 and L5/S1 discs. The present case and a literature review show that a sequestered lumbar disc herniation can regress within a relatively short timeframe without surgery. The authors emphasise the utility of conservative therapy for patients who do not have a definitive surgical indication.\nDocument [9]: Title: Lumbar disc herniation in a child with cystic fibrosis: case report. Abstract: We report a case of child with cystic fibrosis and lumbar disc herniation. An 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain that exacerbated on coughing, sitting, walking, or bending and diminished when lying down. The straight leg raising test was positive when the right leg was lifted at 60 degrees. Crossed leg raising test was negative. Lumbar MRI revealed a L5-S1central disc protrusion. Conservative treatment was not effective and the patient underwent surgery. Postoperatively the patient experienced regression of the pain. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of lumbar disc herniation in a child with cystic fibrosis. Although this case might be coincidental, thorough investigation of back pain, which is frequent in patients with cystic fibrosis, should be performed.\nDocument [10]: Title: Successful Full Endoscopic Surgery for L5 Radiculopathy Due to L4-5 Discal Cyst and Disc Herniation in a Professional Baseball Player. Abstract: Discal cysts are rare intraspinal extradural cysts that communicate with the corresponding intervertebral discs, and the diagnosis is difficult to distinguish from other causes of low back pain and radiculopathy. Optimal management for this type of cyst has not been determined because of its rarity. Here, we report successful treatment of a discal cyst and lumbar disc herniation using full endoscopic surgery in a professional baseball player with a chief complaint of weakness in his left lower leg. He had been treated conservatively but symptoms did not improve. Discography helped us to differentially diagnose discal cyst from other cystic lesions. Conventional surgical treatment would have resulted in considerable loss of baseball playing time for the patient. We opted to perform minimally invasive transforaminal full endoscopic surgery under local anesthesia to treat the discal cyst and lumbar disc herniation simultaneously without resection of bone and ligament handling. We removed the discal cyst and disc herniation, which released tension on the left nerve root at the L5 level, and then performed thermal annuloplasty to avoid recurrence. Postoperative course was good and he returned to play baseball at his original competitive level 3 months later. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of successful full endoscopic surgery for discal cyst and lumbar disc herniation performed simultaneously in a professional baseball player. It can be difficult to decide on the proper treatment for discal cysts, but full endoscopic surgery for symptomatic discal cyst might be one good option especially for elite athletes.\nDocument [11]: Title: Co-occurrence of lumbar spondylolysis and lumbar disc herniation with lumbosacral nerve root anomaly. Abstract: Lumbosacral nerve root anomalies are the leading cause of lumbar surgery failures. Although co-occurrence of lumbar spondylolysis and disc herniation is common, it is very rare to observe that a nerve root anomaly accompanies these lesions. A 49-year-old male patient presented with sudden-onset right leg pain. Examinations revealed L5/S1 lumbar spondylolysis and disc herniation. At preoperative period, he was also diagnosed with lumbosacral root anomaly. Following discectomy and root decompression, stabilization was performed. The complaints of the patient diagnosed with lumbosacral root anomaly at intraoperative period were improved at postoperative period. It should be remembered that in patients with lumbar disc herniation and spondylolysis, lumbar root anomalies may coexist when clinical and neurological picture is severe. Preoperative and perioperative assessments should be made meticulously to prevent neurological injury.\nDocument [12]: Title: Far-lateral Disc Herniation Treated by Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion without Complete Fragment Excision: A Case Report and Review of the Literature. Abstract: Symptomatic far-lateral lumbar disc herniation is a less common causes of lumbar radiculopathy than paracentral or central disc herniation. Treatment of far-lateral disc herniation with a retroperitoneal, transpsoas approach and disc fragment excision has been described. However, treatment of far-lateral disc herniation using lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) without neural manipulation has not been described. We report one case in which symptom resolution was accomplished via indirect decompression with anterior column support via LLIF without disc fragment excision and review the current literature. The patient noted immediate relief of his preoperative leg pain in the recovery room and ambulation began the same day. Narcotics were effective in treating his incisional pain and mild back pain. The patient was seen two weeks postoperatively and he had stopped all narcotics. At six weeks, the patient continued to have significant improvement and was able to take hour-long walks. At five months, the patient did not have any pain and continued to have improvement in his left quadriceps strength. Minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusion has allowed surgeons to provide both direct and indirect neural decompression through a retroperitoneal approach. This technique may be ideal for far-lateral disc herniation as it also allows a lateral visualization of the herniation without bony, posterior muscular, or ligamentous disruption.\nDocument [13]: Title: Voluminous free disk fragment mimicking an extradural tumor. Abstract: A 56-year-old man presented with a rare case of a voluminous herniated disc fragment mimicking an intraspinal extradural tumor on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. He had experienced low back pain and sciatica in his right leg for 12 months, which exacerbated suddenly 4 days before admission accompanied by right quadriceps muscle weakness. MR imaging with gadolinium demonstrated a tumor-like longitudinal lesion, extending from the L1-2 to the L3-4 intervertebral disc spaces and occupying most of the right half of the vertebral canal. L2 and L3 laminectomy, as well as L2-3 right foraminotomy, were performed. We were prepared for an oncological operation, but instead, a huge disc fragment was removed en bloc from the right epidural space. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and he demonstrated full neurological recovery within 2 months. Sequestrated lumbar disc fragments must be considered in the differential diagnosis of longitudinal extradural mass lesions in the spinal canal independently of their size. MR imaging with contrast medium can differentiate herniated disc from tumors and other epidural lesions. Nevertheless, nontypical sequestrated disc herniations are extremely rare and can be misinterpreted.\nDocument [14]: Title: Unusual case of camptocormia triggered by lumbar-disc herniation. Abstract: A 21-year-old male patient with low back pain and marked forward bending was presented. The exaggerated lumbar flexion was preventing him to stand in erect posture but disappeared while lying. The symptoms had begun after he had lifted a heavy object. Straight-leg-raising test could not be performed properly because of the exaggerated pain. The light-touch sense was decreased on L5 and S1 dermatomes. There was no loss of muscle strength. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Plain graph showed mild narrowing in the L4-5 and L5-S1 intervertebral spaces. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed disc protrusions in L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. During his stay in the department, the patient was given tizanidine and tramadol, and physical therapy was performed. A paravertebral intramuscular injection with lidocaine was applied. Moreover, the patient was referred to psychiatrist for evaluation regarding his medical history of conversive seizures and possible efforts for secondary gain. No response was obtained from all the treatments. The final diagnosis was camptocormia triggered by lumbar-disc herniation. He was applied supportive psychotherapy, psychoeducation regarding secondary gain, strong suggestions to improve posture, positive reinforcement, and behavioral therapy. His postural abnormality resolved and disappeared completely with mild pain.\nDocument [15]: Title: Extreme lateral lumbar disc herniation in a 12-year child: case report and review of the literature. Abstract: Extreme lateral lumbar disc herniations (ELLDHs) occur more frequently among elderly patients, with a peak incidence in the sixth decade, and are rarely found in children. The patient presented is a 12-year-old boy with a 3-month history of right-sided leg pain. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an extreme lateral disc herniation on the right at L4-L5 with compression of the L4 nerve root. He subsequently underwent removal of extreme lateral herniated disc through an intertransverse approach under general anesthesia. At 11-month follow-up, the patient maintained resolution of preoperative symptoms and a neurological examination revealed no sensory or motor deficit. Surgical intervention may be indicated for patients with ELLDHs that fail with conservative treatment.\nDocument [16]: Title: Pitting oedema in a polio survivor with lumbar radiculopathy complicated disc herniation. Abstract: We report a 58-year-old male with sequelae of polio who presented with low back and left buttock pain, and pitting oedema of both legs for four months. The patient had a history of poliomyelitis at the age of 1 year which resulted in bilateral lower leg weakness, particularly on the left side. Magnetic resonance imaging showed cervical spinal stenosis secondary to posterior osteophyte formation, left paracentral disc extrusion at L2/L3 and L3/L4 levels with compression of the traversing L4 nerve root. The findings confirmed a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy caused by a herniated disc. The patient subsequently underwent a chiropractic treatment. The painful symptoms and pitting oedema in this case resolved with spinal adjustment in addition to scraping therapy to strengthen bilateral low back and the gluteal muscles. This case provides circumstantial evidence of a scarcely mentioned association between pitting oedema and lumbar radiculopathy caused by disc herniation. The pathophysiological mechanism is elusive, but might involve a complexity of cytokine-mediated inflammation and interconnection between somatic and autonomic nervous systems.\nDocument [17]: Title: Sciatic Herpes Zoster Suspected of Lumbar Disc Herniation: An Infrequent Case Report and Literature Review. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> The symptoms of sciatic herpes zoster are sometimes difficult to distinguish from sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation. We describe a case of suspected lumbar disc herniation with sciatic herpes zoster to reduce the rate of misdiagnosis. <b>Case Report:</b> A 55-year old man, male, developed low back pain after carrying heavy items 20 years ago. Characteristics of symptoms: 1. Symptoms were aggravated in the upright lumbar forward flexion position; 2. The VAS (leg) score was 8-9 points and the VSA (lumbar) score was 0 point; 3. It can be relieved when rested in the supine position; 4. It came on intermittently with radiation pain in the right lower limb. There were several attacks every year. One month ago, there was radiating pain in the right lower limb. The pain was from the back of the right hip, behind the thigh, in lateral crural region, to the back of the foot. And Symptoms worsened for 10 days. The VAS score was 8 points. Pain could not be relieved by rest or changing posture. There was no back pain, no lower limbs, weak walking, no claudication and other symptoms. Analgesics and neurotrophic drugs are ineffective. After the application of antiviral drugs, the radiation pain in the right lower extremity was significantly relieved. <b>Conclusion:</b> We describe this case in detail and discuss how to make an authentic diagnosis, with a concomitant literature review.\nDocument [18]: Title: Cauda Equina Syndrome in a Military Personnel: A Case Report. Abstract: Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but severe neuro-spinal disorder commonly caused due to lumbar disc herniation, which occurs mostly at lower levels of L4-S1. We report a case of 38-year-old male soldier deployed on a foreign mission who presented to a level 1 military hospital 4 months back with complaints of decreased movement of bilateral lower limbs and severe low back pain radiating to the right lower limb for 2 hours. He was referred to a higher centre and diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome due to massive disc herniation at levels L2-L3. He underwent laminotomy and discectomy of the extruded intervertebral disc after 48 hours. On subsequent follow-up, his bladder and lower limbs sensations were normal however, he had bowel incontinence, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, and no significant improvement in power. Hence, early diagnosis, referral, and timely intervention affect the outcomes in a cauda equina syndrome patient.\nDocument [19]: Title: Intradural lumbar disc herniation after percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy: case report. Abstract: A 64-year-old man was referred to the authors with low-back pain (LBP) and right leg pain with a history of previously diagnosed lumbar disc herniation (LDH) at L4-5. He had undergone 2 percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomies (PELDs) for the herniation at another institution, and according to the surgical record of the second surgery, a dural tear occurred intraoperatively but was not repaired. Postoperative conservative treatments such as an epidural block and blood patch had not relieved his persistent LBP or right leg pain. Upon referral to the authors, MRI and myelography revealed an intradural LDH. The herniated mass was removed by durotomy, and posterior lumbar interbody fusion was performed. His symptoms were partially improved after surgery. Primary suture is technically difficult when a dural tear occurs during PELD. Therefore, close attention should be paid to avoiding such tears, and surgeons should increase their awareness of intradural LDH as a possible postoperative complication of PELD.\nDocument [20]: Title: Differential Diagnosis Strategy between Lower Extremity Arterial Occlusive Disease and Lumbar Disc Herniation. Abstract: Considering the increasingly incidence rate of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease and difficult to distinguish from lumbar disc herniation, it is very necessary to exclude lower extremity arterial occlusive disease resulting in lower limb symptoms from lumbar disc herniation. More importantly, who have a higher risk of combining with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease and misdiagnosed as lumbar disc herniation? Why those patients are easy to be misdiagnosed as lumbar disc herniation? It is worth analyzing and discussing. The risk factors including age, gender, the medical history of high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and coronary, pulse pressure, lumbar disc herniation segment and type, ankle-brachial index, and straight leg raising test were observed. The Oswestry disability index and the Japanese Orthopedic Association score were collected preoperative, six months after posterior lumbar interbody fusion and six months after vascular interventional treatment to evaluate the symptoms relief and surgical efficacy. There was a statistically significant difference (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) in pulse pressure, ankle-brachial index, central disc herniation, and straight leg raising test between two groups. There was a high risk to missed diagnosis of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease and misdiagnosed as lumbar disc herniation when patients are with a mild central lumbar disc herniation, higher pulse pressure, lower ankle-brachial index, and straight leg raising test negative. Therefore, sufficient history-taking and cautious physical examinations contributed to find risk factors and attach importance to such patients and, further, to exclude lower extremity arterial occlusive disease from lumbar disc herniation using lower extremity vascular ultrasound examination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to specific biologic and cellular abnormalities that are not fully understood. Psychological factors do not cause IBS, but many people with IBS also have anxiety or depressed mood, a history of adverse life events, or psychosocial stressors. Physicians must understand the fears and expectations of patients and how they think about their symptoms and should also respond empathetically to psychosocial cues. Anxiety related to the unpredictability of symptoms may have a greater effect on quality of life than the symptoms themselves. Patients in generally good health who have ongoing or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal stool patterns most likely have IBS or another functional gastrointestinal disorder. Patients who meet symptom-based criteria and have no alarm features may be confidently diagnosed with few, if any, additional tests. Patients may not completely understand the diagnostic process; asking about expectations and carefully explaining the goals and limitations of testing leads to more effective care. There is no definitive treatment for IBS, and recommended treatments focus on symptom relief and improved quality of life. Trusting patient-physician interactions are essential to help patients understand and accept an IBS diagnosis and to actively engage in effective self-management.\nDocument [2]: Title: Clinical pearls for irritable bowel syndrome: management of the diarrhea-predominant subtype. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort and is subtyped by the predominant stool symptoms of constipation, diarrhea, or mixed constipation and diarrhea. The diagnosis of IBS was once considered to be one of exclusion, but data now show that exhaustive tests provide very limited diagnostic yield. Instead, the symptom-based Rome criteria can be used to make a confident determination of IBS. For patients diagnosed with IBS, pharmacological decisions are based on the underlying disturbances such as abdominal pain, bowel symptoms, and urgency; how the condition affects quality of life; and symptom severity. Traditionally, treatment of IBS has focused on one or two individual symptoms rather than syndrome relief; however, emerging evidence on newer targeted treatment options is drawing clinical attention. Targeted treatment will require ongoing evaluation of disease severity, as current data show that severe IBS is more common than previously thought and severity influences treatment choices. This article reviews the disease state of IBS, answers questions about the condition, and discusses the evidence supporting current management options.\nDocument [3]: Title: Psychological Interventions for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients often present psychoform symptoms or psychiatric disorders. Among the psychological factors studied in IBS patients, two seem to influence mostly its severity: catastrophizing and somatization. Somatization is an independent risk factor for IBS. In addition, somatization more than the severity of IBS influences the way the patients perceive their illness, the outcome and the efficacy of treatment. Irritable bowel syndrome patients demonstrate greater catastrophizing scores than controls, and pain catastrophizing is a significant predictor of gastrointestinal symptoms related to pain. In this context we analysed the data regarding the efficacy of two psychological treatments in IBS: cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnosis. Cognitive behavioral therapy is focused on replacing maladaptive coping strategies with more positive cognitions and behaviors. Several studies showed that cognitive behavioral therapy is effective in reducing bowel symptoms in IBS, both post-treatment and short-term follow-up. Gut-directed hypnotherapy has beneficial short-term effects in improving gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with IBS, and the results are maintained after one year in half of the patients. Psychological treatments are a suitable option for selected IBS patients.\nDocument [4]: Title: A Mexican Honeymoon Marred by Gastrointestinal Upset: A Case of Dientamoeba fragilis Causing Post-infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Abstract: Dientamoeba fragilis (D. fragilis) is an anaerobic intestinal protozoan parasite that has been associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms. We report a case of post-infectious IBS caused by D. fragilis treated successfully with metronidazole. A 33-year-old African American male with an unremarkable past medical history was seen in the office with a three-month history of intermittent, generalized, crampy abdominal pain with bloating and flatulence without associated weight loss. He visited Mexico for his honeymoon four months ago. Initial lab work was normal. Dietary changes including fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet and loperamide were prescribed with the presumptive diagnosis of IBS; however, his symptoms persisted. Three samples of stool for ova and parasites (O&P) were positive for D. fragilis. The patient was treated with metronidazole for 14 days. Repeat fecal O&P were negative. Upon follow-up, the patient' symptoms substantially improved with a resolution of abdominal pain and flatulence. Infection caused by D. fragilis may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. It is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, and alteration of bowel movements, resembling IBS. The diagnosis is made via the detection of D. fragilis trophozoites in appropriately fixed and stained stool samples or by a polymerase chain reaction. Treatment options include tetracyclines, paromomycin, metronidazole, and Iodoquinol. Further epidemiologic studies may help in elucidating the association between D. fragilis and IBS.\nDocument [5]: Title: Prediction of symptomatic improvement after exposure-based treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. Abstract: Several studies show that psychological treatments relieve symptoms for patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there are no consistent findings that show what patient characteristics make a psychological treatment more or less likely to result in improvement. We have previously conducted a study of a newly developed internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) that emphasized exposure to IBS symptoms and IBS-related situations and reduced symptom-related avoidance. The study showed that the treatment led to improvement in IBS symptoms compared to a waiting list and that treatment gains were maintained over a 15-18 month follow-up period. The aim of the present study was to investigate several possible predictors of short- and long-term treatment outcome in terms of symptom improvement, based on data collected in the previously conducted treatment trial.\nDocument [6]: Title: New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: from pathophysiology to treatment. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common reason to visit a gastroenterologist. IBS was believed to be a functional disease, but many possible pathophysiologic mechanisms can now explain the symptoms. IBS patients are classified into subtypes according to their predominant bowel habit, based on the Rome IV criteria. These include diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant IBS, as well as the mixed type, a combination of the two. Usually, IBS treatment is based on the predominant symptoms, with many options for each subtype. A new promising treatment option, fecal microbiota transplantation, seems to have beneficial effects on IBS. However, treating the pathophysiological causative agent responsible for the symptoms is an emerging approach. Therefore, before the appropriate therapeutic option is chosen for treating IBS, a clinical evaluation of its pathophysiology should be performed.\nDocument [7]: Title: Gastroesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome: a common overlap syndrome. Abstract: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are very common disorders in the general population. Symptoms of IBS are commonly encountered in GERD patients, and symptoms of GERD are not uncommon in IBS patients. GERD patients consistently report lower abdominal symptoms, which may be part of the spectrum of GERD symptoms. Alternatively, GERD and IBS may be two distinct manifestations of a similar underlying pathophysiologic process that can affect different levels of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the reason for the overlap observed between GERD and IBS remains to be elucidated, recent studies have demonstrated that GERD patients who also suffer from IBS-like symptoms perceive their GERD-related symptoms as more severe and are less likely to respond to antireflux treatment, as compared with those without IBS.\nDocument [8]: Title: Irritable bowel syndrome: what do patients really want? Abstract: Knowing what patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) want or expect from their medical care is critical in helping them manage the symptoms of this common, chronic gastrointestinal condition. Failure to identify patient expectations can lead to patient dissatisfaction with care, lack of compliance with prescribed treatments, and the inappropriate use of medical resources. Surprisingly little is known about what patients with IBS really want. Several studies suggest that IBS patients value the relational aspects of medical care as highly as technical skills and knowledge. There seems to be a significant communication gap between health care providers and patients regarding IBS care. This article reviews what is known about IBS patients' expectations and needs.\nDocument [9]: Title: A Narrative Review of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea: A Primer for Primary Care Providers. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain in association with more frequent, loose stools. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) includes disordered gut motility, alterations in gut microbiota, neural-hormonal system abnormalities, immune reactivity, and visceral hypersensitivity. Timely diagnosis of IBS-D can be achieved easily using clinical criteria. Formal IBS diagnosis is important for optimizing treatment and patient outcomes and facilitating patient access to appropriate educational resources. Yet, given the symptom overlap with other gastrointestinal conditions, diagnosis of IBS-D often is perceived to be challenging. Treatment of IBS includes both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options. Rifaximin, alosetron, and eluxadoline are effective treatments indicated for IBS-D, but have limited availability internationally. Dietary approaches may also be indicated for certain patients with IBS-D. Psychological interventions may be effective in treating abdominal pain alone and global symptoms in IBS. We describe use of these diverse therapies and provide an overview to facilitate the primary care provider's approach to distinguishing IBS-D from other conditions with symptom overlap.\nDocument [10]: Title: [Pain therapy in irritable bowel syndrome]. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases. It is characterized by chronic abdominal pain, typically associated with altered bowel habits that cannot be explained by structural abnormalities in routine diagnostic workup. Based on the predominant symptom, IBS can be divided into different subtypes: IBS with predominant constipation, diarrhea, bloating, or pain. Knowledge about the complex and multifactorial IBS pathophysiology has increased tremendously in recent years, e.g., IBS may be related to alterations in gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity, and the mucosal immune system. It is important, both for the patient and the physician, that IBS diagnosis is made quickly and thoroughly based on the typical symptom complex and exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses and to reassure the patient that IBS is a chronic, but benign disease. These components are the fundamental basis for a good patient-physician relationship and for a successful long-term management of this potentially very compromising disorder. IBS therapy is based on general measures as well as symptom-oriented medical therapy, where improvement of abdominal pain is one of the main goals in treating IBS patients. Several pain treatment options are available, which may be used long-term or on demand and which may be combined with other therapies. General medical approaches include antispasmodics, improvement of bowel function, phytotherapy, and probiotics. Especially in patients with psychological comorbidities, antidepressants may be used. Modern drug treatments include the GC-C agonist linaclotide in IBS with predominant constipation, the locally acting antibiotic rifaximin in IBS with bloating, and 5-HT3 antagonists in IBS with predominant diarrhea. Psychotherapy should be included in an interdisciplinary approach in refractory cases or in psychological comorbidity.\nDocument [11]: Title: Is there an appropriate strategy for treating co-morbid irritable bowel syndrome and bladder pain syndrome? Abstract: Two of the most frequent components of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) are irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS), characterized by considerable overlapping symptoms and pathophysiology. Currently, its management is challenging meaning there is high the demand for novel efficient therapeutics to aid patient care and to tackle the socioeconomic burden of IBS and BPS. As there are presently no sufficient treatment strategies, identifying the mechanisms that result in their main symptoms is the opportunity for developing appropriate therapies. Areas covered: Herein, the authors explore the potential common treatment strategies for co-morbid IBS and BPS and highlight the absolute need for further research of these deliberating clinical entities. Expert opinion: In the future, the authors summise that the discovery of predictive molecular biomarkers combined with clinical phenotypic categorization will likely allow for more definitive differentiation of patients and thus for better treatment options. Furthermore, it has been suggested that effective IBS treatment strategies would be of great value to co-morbid IBS and BPS therapy.\nDocument [12]: Title: Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Clinical Review. Abstract: Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common in population studies including chronic abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. Patients often have associated gastrointestinal and somatic symptoms suggesting a possible common contributing mechanism, but the heterogeneous symptom patterns of individual patients make generalizations difficult. The pathophysiology of IBS is incompletely understood but includes disturbances of the brain-gut axis. Central mechanisms are: the psychosocial history and environment, dysfunctional brain processing of peripheral signals attributed to the intestine including the enteric nervous system, the microbiome and the innate and adaptive immune system. As a result there is visceral hypersensitivity and disturbed intestinal secretory and motor activity. Some mechanisms of visceral pain hypersensitivity may overlap with other pain syndromes including fibromyalgia (FMS). Central Sensitization (CS) would offer a way to conceptualize an integration of life experience and psychologic response into a biopsychosocial framework of pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of IBS. Corticotropin-releasing factor, a principle regulator in the stress and pain response may contribute to a neuroendocrine mechanism for the brain-gut interaction. The positive diagnostic approach to IBS symptoms to avoid excess testing and enhance the patient-provider therapeutic relationship requires the recognition of the \"cluster\" of IBS symptoms while identifying \"alarm\" symptoms requiring specific attention. The severity of the symptoms and other individual psychosocial factors characterize patients who seek medical care. The presence of significant psychosocial comorbidities adds to the complexity of management which often requires a multidisciplinary approach. Several treatment options exist but no single method is effective for all the symptoms of IBS. The therapeutic benefit of the well-executed physician-patient relationship is considered essential to success in managing IBS symptoms over the long term.\nDocument [13]: Title: [ATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS ABOUT IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME]. Abstract: Diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is often a problem for general practitioners (GPs) because they rely on symptoms without specific biological markers. The objective was to examine the attitudes and knowledge of GPs in identifying and treating patients with IBS. The study included 51 GPs who take care of 87,000 patients, approximately 1,530 of them with IBS, on the basis of a questionnaire developed for this study in two health centers in Zagreb. The questionnaire contained questions with a case vignette on GP attitudes and knowledge about IBS. In comparison with other pain conditions, GPs were found to have least confidence and pleasure, while spending a lot of time and finding it most difficult to diagnose and treat patients suffering from IBS. In the case vignette, GPs answered correctly that it was IBS (84%) and most of them would give dietary advice and follow up the patient (67%). For the diagnosis of IBS, most physicians considered necessary to take diagnostic criteria into account, exclude alarming symptoms and do basic laboratory tests (39%). Most GPs considered IBS to be a functional bowel disorder (92%), 63% used diagnostic criteria for IBS, and 61% were familiar with the Rome III criteria for IBS. Gastroenterologists would be consulted by 53% of GPs in case of uncertain diagnosis and 35% of GPs for therapeutic inefficiency. In the treatment of IBS, most GPs (51%) prescribe pharmacotherapy for functional bowel disorders. The authors conclude that GPs showed great knowledge in recognizing and diagnosing IBS, but compared to other painful conditions they have little self-confidence and pleasure. They spend a lot of time and find it most difficult to diagnose and treat patients suffering from IBS. Additional education is needed with a more proactive approach in the form of workshops, which may bring change in their attitudes and improve their knowledge.\nDocument [14]: Title: Multidimensionality of symptom complexes in irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders. Abstract: The definition of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by Rome criteria was a major advancement in the nosology of the disease, but this goal was achieved by employing symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract and by eliminating all symptoms that were nonspecific. The description of the course of the illness and response to treatment has been hampered by restrictions to the defining characteristics, abdominal pain and altered bowel habit. Other abdominal symptoms (e.g., bloating, nausea, and epigastric discomfort) and general somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache, and sleep disturbance) are not included in the Rome definition, yet are commonly reported by patients with IBS. This article addresses the following questions: Are comorbid conditions part of or distinct from the syndrome of IBS and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs)? Are there overlapping abdominal or extra-abdominal symptoms confounding the definition of IBS? Are extra-abdominal somatic symptoms and/or syndromes part of the clinical presentation of IBS? Are \"nondiagnostic\" abdominal symptoms important in defining symptom burden in IBS? Is the concept of somatization related to IBS, and, if so, how? How can we better define the symptom burden in IBS and other FGIDs? In short, have we hampered the evaluation of IBS (and other FGIDs) by making the definitions too reductionist? While definite answers to the above questions are not possible at this time, this article proposes that the definitions of IBS or other FGIDs not be altered, but that in the process of evaluation of the clinical end points and/or severity of the diseases, consideration be given to the possibility of including other components of the symptom burden of these disorders.\nDocument [15]: Title: Food supplements and diet as treatment options in irritable bowel syndrome. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional bowel disorder affecting 5.7% of the general population. Most patients relate their symptoms of IBS to foods they consume with diet being the most frequently reported factor impacting their life. However, although some foods may trigger symptoms, others may provide symptom relief. Indeed, several foods and diets have been investigated for their effectiveness in relieving IBS symptoms. In this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 160 patients with IBS demonstrated Aloe vera not to be effective in improving IBS symptoms. The aim of this review is to discuss the evidence on the effect of food supplements and diets in the management of IBS. Specifically, this review examines the evidence for aloe vera, peppermint oil, probiotics, fiber and prebiotics, healthy eating, the low FODMAP diet, and the gluten-free diet.\nDocument [16]: Title: [Guidelines for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome]. Abstract: Traditional symptom-based therapies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are directed at the relief of individual IBS symptoms, but they are often of limited efficacy in addressing the entire symptom complex. Combinations of drugs to target bothersome symptoms are suggested as the first-line pharmacologic treatment. Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of IBS has resulted in the development of several new therapeutic approaches. Thirteen consensus statements for the treatment of IBS were developed using the modified Delphi approach. Exclusion diets have modest efficacy in improving symptoms in some IBS patients. Symptom-based therapies with dietary fiber, bulking agents, laxatives, antispasmodics and laxatives are effective in the improvement of some individual symptoms, e.g. dietary fiber and bulking agents for constipation, laxatives for constipation, antispasmodics for abdominal pain and discomfort, antidiarrheals for diarrhea. 5HT3 receptor antagonists and 5HT((4)) receptor agonists are effective in the relief of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits. A short term course of nonabsorbable antibiotics may improve global IBS symptoms, particularly in patients with diarrhea- predominant IBS. Some probiotics appear to have the potential benefit in improving global IBS symptoms. Selective C-2 chloride channel activator is more effective than placebo at relieving global IBS symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are equally effective in relieving global IBS symptoms, and have some benefits in treating abdominal pain. Certain types of psychologic therapy may be effective in improving global symptoms in some IBS patients. Further studies are strongly needed to develop better treatment strategies for Korean patients with IBS.\nDocument [17]: Title: Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for irritable bowel syndrome 2020. Abstract: Managing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has attracted international attention because single-agent therapy rarely relieves bothersome symptoms for all patients. The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology (JSGE) published the first edition of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for IBS in 2015. Much more evidence has accumulated since then, and new pharmacological agents and non-pharmacological methods have been developed. Here, we report the second edition of the JSGE-IBS guidelines comprising 41 questions including 12 background questions on epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic criteria, 26 clinical questions on diagnosis and treatment, and 3 questions on future research. For each question, statements with or without recommendations and/or evidence level are given and updated diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are provided based on new evidence. Algorithms for diagnosis are requisite for patients with chronic abdominal pain or associated symptoms and/or abnormal bowel movement. Colonoscopy is indicated for patients with one or more alarm symptoms/signs, risk factors, and/or abnormal routine examination results. The diagnosis is based on the Rome IV criteria. Step 1 therapy consists of diet therapy, behavioral modification, and gut-targeted pharmacotherapy for 4 weeks. For non-responders, management proceeds to step 2 therapy, which includes a combination of different mechanistic gut-targeted agents and/or psychopharmacological agents and basic psychotherapy for 4 weeks. Step 3 therapy is for non-responders to step 2 and comprises a combination of gut-targeted pharmacotherapy, psychopharmacological treatments, and/or specific psychotherapy. These updated JSGE-IBS guidelines present best practice strategies for IBS patients in Japan and we believe these core strategies can be useful for IBS diagnosis and treatment globally.\nDocument [18]: Title: 2008 Clinical approach to irritable bowel syndrome. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as defined by Rome III diagnostic criteria, affects 10-20% of the general population, with women 20-40 years old accounting for the majority of patients. Although variable and intermittent, IBS symptoms may persist for many years. Repeated referrals for medical consultation and diagnostic studies generate huge healthcare costs. Since there is no evidence that IBS leads to more severe gastrointestinal disorders, in absence of alarm symptoms or signs, an invasive diagnostic algorithm is not indicated. Optimal treatment for IBS still needs to be defined. The clinical approach is based on treatment of the prevalent symptom. When pain predominates, antispasmodics are the first choice. In case of diarrhea, loperamide is useful for reducing bowel frequency. Soluble fiber represents the first option in subjects with IBS and constipation or mixed IBS. Dietary integrators composed of probiotics and serotonin precursors are a promising therapeutic option.\nDocument [19]: Title: Elimination of Fermentable Carbohydrates to Reduce Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Pediatric Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Narrative Review. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is classified as a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel function. Although the pathophysiology of IBS is incompletely understood, fermentable carbohydrates are implicated as a potential cause of symptoms. An elimination diet, such as a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet, represents a potential intervention for reducing GI symptoms in patients with IBS. The role of fermentable carbohydrates in symptom onset is well studied in adult patients with IBS; however, less research exists in the pediatric population. This review sought to explore evidence for the role of dietary fermentable carbohydrate elimination to reduce GI symptoms (abdominal pain, stool changes, abdominal bloating) in children and adolescents (4-19 years of age) diagnosed with IBS based on Rome III or IV criteria. Five studies of neutral to positive quality rating were identified and analyzed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Process. These studies demonstrate that dietary elimination of fermentable carbohydrates, such as through a low-FODMAP diet, reduces the severity of 1 or more GI symptoms in about one-quarter to one-half of pediatric patients with IBS. Patients without improvement are considered \"nonresponders\" and may require an alternative intervention. More research is needed to establish the best way to identify patients who would respond to elimination diets vs other IBS treatment strategies.\nDocument [20]: Title: Fructose and irritable bowel syndrome. Abstract: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterised by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort and transit disturbances with heterogeneous pathophysiological mechanisms. The link between food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is often reported by patients with IBS and the role of fructose has recently been highlighted. Fructose malabsorption can easily be assessed by hydrogen and/or methane breath test in response to 25 g fructose; and its prevalence is about 22 % in patients with IBS. The mechanism of fructose-related symptoms is incompletely understood. Osmotic load, fermentation and visceral hypersensitivity are likely to participate in GI symptoms in the IBS population and may be triggered or worsened by fructose. A low-fructose diet could be integrated in the overall treatment strategy, but its role and implication in the improvement of IBS symptoms should be evaluated. In the present review, we discuss fructose malabsorption in adult patients with IBS and the interest of a low-fructose diet in order to underline the important role of fructose in IBS.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is commonly believed to increase the risk of bone mineral loss, leading to osteoporosis and an increased risk of disabling fractures. In this narrative review, we will presenting a summary of the published medical literature in regards to the relationship between IBD and the development of osteoporosis, bone mineral loss, and fractures. We will explore the epidemiology of metabolic bone disease in IBD, focusing on the prevalence and both the general and IBD-specific risk factors for the development of osteoporosis and of fracture in persons with IBD. We will also examine the role of the inflammatory process in IBD promoting excessive bone mineral loss, as well as the role that low body mass, corticosteroid use, diet, and nutrient malabsorption play in contributing to bone disease. Last, we will discuss our recommendation for: screening for osteoporosis in IBD patients, the use of preventative strategies, and therapeutic interventions for treating osteoporosis in persons with IBD.\nDocument [2]: Title: Osteoporosis and Osteoporotic Fractures in Gastrointestinal Disease. Abstract: Patients with gastrointestinal disease (GI) are at risk for osteopenia or osteoporosis, which can lead to fractures. Although these patients may be at risk from a young age, gastroenterologists often overlook this fact in practice. There are well-known GI diseases associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, such as the post-gastrectomy state, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and celiac disease. As there is an increase in the prevalence of IBD patients, newly diagnosed celiac disease in adulthood, and gastric cancer survivors following gastrectomy, bone disease in these patients becomes an important issue. Here, we have discussed osteoporosis and fractures in GI disease, especially in the post-gastrectomy state, IBD, and celiac disease. Although the pathogenesis of bone loss in each disease has not been fully identified, we have confirmed that the prevalence of osteoporosis and fractures in each of these diseases is high. There are scarce studies comparing the prevalence of osteoporosis or osteoporotic fractures in GI disease patients with studies in postmenopausal women, and specific guidelines for their management in each disease have not been established. Intensive surveillance and management are needed to ensure that these patients attain peak bone mass for age and sex to prevent fractures.\nDocument [3]: Title: Bone Health in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory medical condition with relapses and remission. Metabolic bone disease, including osteoporosis, is associated with IBD and imparts a significant morbidity if pathologic fractures were to occur. There has been a significant amount of research that evaluated the pathophysiology and associations between IBD and osteoporosis. Although corticosteroids contribute to the risk of low bone mineral density, osteoporosis and fractures, older age, female gender, smoking, and family history of fracture have been shown to contribute. Additionally, intestinal inflammation affects bone resorption and formation through proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 further accelerating bone loss. Little information is available on standardizing screening or treatment. It is important to recognize the risk factors that are associated with IBD and osteoporosis to identify the patient population at risk and initiate treatment/prevention strategies early. Treatment can include calcium, vitamin D, or bisphosphonates. Some studies showed benefit of treating the underlying IBD to improve bone mineral density.\nDocument [4]: Title: Inflammatory bowel diseases as secondary causes of osteoporosis. Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. Initial studies suggested very high rates of osteoporosis in IBD, but more recent studies have suggested that bone mineral density (BMD) is often normal in patients with IBD and typically changes little over time. Nonetheless, IBD is associated with an increased risk of fractures. Doctors managing patients with IBD must consider a variety of risk factors, not just BMD measurements, in assessing fracture risk. Advances have been made in exploring the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in IBD. The evolution of knowledge regarding receptor for activated factor of nuclear factor kappaB (RANK), its ligand RANKL, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), which serves as a decoy receptor, has enhanced the understanding of both osteoporosis and T-cell immunobiology. Recent clinical studies in patients with IBD have revealed that serum OPG levels may be elevated and inflamed intestinal tissue secretes increased amounts of OPG. It is suspected that OPG levels are elevated as a counterregulatory response to low BMD, as serum OPG levels in IBD have been found to be inversely associated with BMD. Finally, in animal models of IBD, exogenous OPG has reversed both the osteopenia and the enterocolitis, suggesting that it may have a therapeutic role in human IBD.\nDocument [5]: Title: Skeletal morbidity in inflammatory bowel disease. Abstract: Patients with Crohn's disease are at increased risk of developing disturbances in bone and mineral metabolism because of several factors, including the cytokine-mediated nature of the inflammatory bowel disease, the intestinal malabsorption resulting from disease activity or from extensive intestinal resection and the use of glucucorticoids to control disease activity. Inability to achieve peak bone mass when the disease starts in childhood, malnutrition, immobilization, low BMI, smoking and hypogonadism may also play a contributing role in the pathogenesis of bone loss. The relationship between long-term use of glucocorticoids for any disease indication and increased risk for osteoporosis and fractures is well established. However, the relationship between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and bone loss remains controversial. Depending on the population studied the prevalence of osteoporosis has thus been variably reported to range from 12 to 42% in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In IBD most studies demonstrate a negative correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and glucocorticoid use, but not all authors agree on the relationship between long-term glucocorticoid use and continuing bone loss. Whereas prospective studies do suggest sustained bone loss at both trabecular and cortical sites in long-term glucocorticoid users with inflammatory bowel disease, a decrease in bone mass is also observed in patients with active Crohn's disease not using glucocorticoids, and bone loss is not universally observed in patients with Crohn's disease using orally or rectally administered glucocorticoids. Data on vertebral fractures are scarce and there is no agreement about the risk of non-vertebral fractures in patients with Crohn's disease, although it has been suggested that non-vertebral fracture risk may be increased by up to 60% in patients with IBD. A recent publication reports an increased risk of hip fractures in Crohn's disease related to current and cumulative corticosteroid use and use of opiates, although these fractures could not be related to the severity of osteoporosis. The issue of the magnitude of the problem of osteoporosis has become particularly relevant in Crohn's disease, since the ability of therapeutic interventions to beneficially influence skeletal morbidity has been clearly established in patients with osteoporosis, whether post-menopausal women, men or glucocorticoid users. The main question that arises is whether all patients with Crohn's disease should be treated with bone protective agents on the assumption that they all have the potential to develop osteoporosis or whether the use of these agents should be restricted to patients clearly at risk of osteoporosis and fractures, providing these can be identified. We recommend, based on the available literature and our own experience, that all patients with Crohn's disease should be screened for osteoporosis by means of a bone mineral density measurement in addition to full correction of any potential calcium and vitamin D deficiency, to allow timely therapeutic intervention of the patient at risk while sparing the vast majority unnecessary medical treatment.\nDocument [6]: Title: Risk factors for osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients exhibit higher risk for bone loss than the general population. The chronic inflammation causes a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), which leads to osteopenia and osteoporosis. This article reviewed each risk factor for osteoporosis in IBD patients. Inflammation is one of the factors that contribute to osteoporosis in IBD patients, and the main system that is involved in bone loss is likely RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin. Smoking is a risk factor for bone loss and fractures, and many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this loss. Body composition also interferes in bone metabolism and increasing muscle mass may positively affect BMD. IBD patients frequently use corticosteroids, which stimulates osteoclastogenesis. IBD patients are also associated with vitamin D deficiency, which contributes to bone loss. However, infliximab therapy is associated with improvements in bone metabolism, but it is not clear whether the effects are because of inflammation improvement or infliximab use. Ulcerative colitis patients with proctocolectomy and ileal pouches and Crohn's disease patients with ostomy are also at risk for bone loss, and these patients should be closely monitored.\nDocument [7]: Title: Osteoporosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: risk factors, prevention, and treatment. Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for osteoporotic fracture. Bone density testing and osteoporosis management are recommended for IBD patients at greater risk for fracture (ie, postmenopausal women, men aged . 60 years, and those with low body mass indices, glucocorticoid use, family history of osteoporosis, and malabsorption). Patient management includes modification of osteoporosis risk factors, such as calcium and vitamin D supplementation, hormone deficiency correction, and smoking cessation. When indicated, bisphosphonates, such as risedronate and alendronate, have been shown to increase bone mass and reduce fracture risk in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor a antibody, increases bone mineral density, but this effect has not as yet translated into reduced fracture risk.\nDocument [8]: Title: [Inflammatory bowel disease and bone decreased bone mineral density]. Abstract: Metabolic bone diseases such as osteopenia and osteoporosis increase the risk of bone fracture that negatively affects quality of life of individuals. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD), including ulcerative colitis(UC)and Crohn's disease(CD), have been shown to be at increased risk of decreased bone mineral density, however frequency of metabolic bone disease in IBD and identified risk factors are varied among reports.\nDocument [9]: Title: Advances in the understanding of mineral and bone metabolism in inflammatory bowel diseases. Abstract: Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.\nDocument [10]: Title: Perspective on skeletal health in inflammatory bowel disease. Abstract: Osteopenia and osteoporosis are common features in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, Crohn's disease is associated with increased fracture risk. The etiology of bone loss in IBD is multifactorial. It includes insufficient intake or absorption of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium; smoking; a low peak bone mass; a low body mass index; and decreased physical activity. In several studies, it has been shown that elevated concentrations of systemic and local pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, and IL-17, present in IBD patients are potentially detrimental for bone metabolism and may be responsible for bone loss and increased fracture risk. This perspective aims to review the current literature on the role of inflammatory factors in the pathophysiology of skeletal problems in IBD and to suggest potential treatment to improve bone health, based on a combination of evidence and clinical and pathophysiological reasoning.\nDocument [11]: Title: Review article: bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease. Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased incidence of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis with osteoporotic pain syndromes, fragility fractures and osteonecrosis accounts for significant morbidity and impacts negatively on the quality of life. It is generally agreed that there is a need to increase awareness for inflammatory bowel disease-associated osteoporosis. However, the best ways in which to identify at-risk patients, the epidemiology of fractures and an evidence-based rational prevention strategy remain to be established. The overall prevalence of IBD-associated osteoporosis is 15%, with higher rates seen in older and underweight subjects. The incidence of fractures is about 1 per 100 patient years, with fracture rates dramatically increasing with age. While old age is a significant risk factor, disease type (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) is not related to osteoporosis risk. Corticosteroid use is a major variable influencing IBD-associated bone loss; however, it is difficult to separate the effects of corticosteroids from those of disease activity. The recommendations in inflammatory bowel disease are similar to those for postmenopausal osteoporosis, with emphasis on lifestyle modification, vitamin D (400-800 IE daily) and calcium (1000-1500 mg daily) supplementation and hormone replacement therapy (oestrogens/selective oestrogen receptor modulators in women, testosterone in hypogonadal men). Bisphosphonates have been approved for patients with osteoporosis (T-score < 2.5), osteoporotic fragility fractures and patients receiving continuous steroid medication. Data on the recently Food and Drug Administration-approved osteoanabolic substance parathyroid hormone and on osteoprotegerin are promising in terms of both steroid-induced and inflammation-mediated osteoporosis, the key elements of inflammatory bowel disease-associated bone disease.\nDocument [12]: Title: Bone Metabolism in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases 2. Abstract: Inflammatory Bowel Disease encompasses Crohns Disease, which is capable of affecting the entire GI tract, although usually favors the ileocolonic and perianal areas, and Ulcerative Colitis, which is limited to the colon. The pathophysiology is not fully understood but is thought to be caused by a complex interplay among gut microbiota, dysregulation of the hosts immune system, genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are considered to be extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Osteoporosis is usually diagnosed by dual-energy X-ray absortiometry. Early interventions to treat active CD and preventative treatment strategies to reduce excessive bone loss might prevent long term consequences of bone loss, including fractures. The immune response in IBD includes increased production of variety of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1&#946;, TNF&#945;, IL6 a IL1 from T cells and macrophages. These have both direct and indirect effects on bone turnover. Vitamin D is vital in mantenance of bone strenght, mineralisation and fracture prevention. Vitamin Ds physiological importance has also been implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases, mainly asthma, atherosclerosis and autoimmune disease.\nDocument [13]: Title: Bone metabolism in inflammatory bowel diseases 1.

Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for osteoporosis and fracture. This is considered to be relevant to IBD-related risk factors, including intestinal inflammation, low nutrient status and the use of corticosteroids, in addition to general risk factors, such as age, gender and BMI et al. A recent meta-analysis suggests that bisphosphonate is effective and safe for the treatment of low bone mineral density and reduce risk of vertebral fractures in patients with IBD. With recent advances in medical treatment for IBD, the number of elderly IBD patients is expected to increase in future. Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis associated with IBD is essential for improving QOL of patients with IBD.\nDocument [15]: Title: Discriminatory ability of calcaneal quantitative ultrasound in the assessment of bone status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Abstract: A high incidence of bone disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) requires frequent monitoring of skeletal status and, for that reason, evaluation of radiation-free technology is an issue of interest. Our objective was to appraise the parameters of calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS): broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS) and stiffness index (QUI), and establish their t-score values to investigate discriminatory ability of QUS in IBD patients with metabolic bone disease. The study included 126 patients (Crohn's disease [n = 94] and ulcerative colitis [n = 32]), and 228 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Bone status was evaluated on the same day by calcaneal QUS and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at spine (L1-L4) and total hip. All QUS measurements were lower in patients compared with healthy controls (BUA p < 0.001; SOS p < 0.001; QUI p < 0.001) and correlated significantly but inversely with disease duration (r = -0.3, p = 0.002). There was no difference with respect to type of disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) or corticosteroid therapy. All three QUS t-scores were significantly lower in patients who had previously sustained fragile fractures (n = 28) than in those without fracture in their history (n = 98) (t-scores: BUA -2.0 vs. -1.3, p = 0.008; SOS -2.1 vs. -1.4, p = 0.02: QUI -2.3 vs. -1.5, p = 0.009). Axial DXA was not significantly different between the fracture and nonfracture patients (-1.7 vs. -1.2, p = 0.1), whereas total hip DXA showed a discriminatory power between the two (-1.6 vs. -0.7, p = 0.001). Patients with t-score < -1.0 scanned by DXA were classified as bone disease. The sensitivity of QUS to identify bone disease was 93% and specificity 63%. The sensitivity of QUS to detect osteopenia was 84% and 72% for osteoporosis. Alternatively, lower negative QUS t-score cutoff <or= -1.8 identified 83% of osteoporosis at lumbar spine and 100% at total hip. All three QUS variables had t-scores less than -1.8 when osteoporosis was detected at both spine and hip. However, the subgroup of IBD patients with QUI t-score cutoff <or= -1.8 still included 26% of individuals with normal bone status. Calcaneal QUS measurements may identify patients with IBD who are at a higher risk of fracture independently of DXA measurements. However, QUS showed poor agreement with bone status scanned by DXA and a low discriminatory power between osteopenia and osteoporosis.\nDocument [16]: Title: Clinical relevance of changes in bone metabolism in inflammatory bowel disease. Abstract: Low bone mineral density is an established, frequent, but often neglected complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Data regarding the diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of low bone mass in IBD has been partially extrapolated from postmenopausal osteoporosis; however, the pathophysiology of bone loss is altered in young patients with IBD. Fracture, a disabling complication, is the most important clinical outcome of low bone mass. Estimation of fracture risk in IBD is difficult. Numerous risk factors have to be considered, and these factors should be weighed properly to help in the identification of the appropriate patients for screening. In this editorial, the authors aim to highlight the most important clinical aspects of the epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of IBD-related bone loss.\nDocument [17]: Title: Diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease. Abstract: Osteoporosis is a frequent finding in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The prevalence of vertebral fractures in those patients with significantly reduced bone mineral density is up to 22%. Factors contributing to osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are treatment with glucocorticoids, increased cytokine production by the inflammation itself, malabsorption and possibly hypogonadism. Therefore, consequent treatment of the underlying IBD and minimising therapy with systemic glucocorticoids, as well as the adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, may be very important measures to prevent bone loss in IBD. In patients with osteoporosis associated with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, various treatment strategies, such as sodium fluoride and aminobisphosphonates, are discussed. Unfortunately, interventional studies in secondary osteoporosis are often limited by the small study population. The efficacy in prevention of vertebral fractures is not proven in any of the described treatment modalities in these patients. Therefore, guidelines are based on data using bone density as the most accepted surrogate marker and treatment guidelines are based on data from patients with postmenopausal and steroid-induced osteoporosis.\nDocument [18]: Title: Does the Antitumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 Therapy Decrease the Vertebral Fractures Occurrence in Inflammatory Bowel Disease? Abstract: Osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture risk are extraintestinal manifestations of the inflammatory bowel disease, whose etiopathogenic mechanisms have not been determined yet. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 are used in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it is unknown if they play a role in osteoporotic fracture prevention. The objective of this study was to know if anti-TNF decreases fracture risk or modifies bone mineral density. To determine the possible risk factors associated with fractures, and assess the incidence of vertebral fractures in IBD patients.\nDocument [19]: Title: Bone health in inflammatory bowel disease. Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of systemic inflammation, manifesting not only as gastrointestinal symptoms but also as extraintestinal bone complications, including osteopenia and osteoporosis. However, the association between IBD and osteoporosis is complex, and the presence of multifactorial participants in the development of osteoporosis is increasingly recognized. Unlike in adults, delayed puberty and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis abnormalities are essential risk factors for osteoporosis in pediatric patients with IBD.\nDocument [20]: Title: Basic and clinical aspects of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease. Abstract: Low bone mineral density and the increased risk of fracture in gastrointestinal diseases have a multifactorial pathogenesis. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia and epidemiologic studies have reported an increased prevalence of low bone mass in patients with IBD. Certainly, genetics play an important role, along with other factors such as systemic inflammation, malnutrition, hypogonadism, glucocorticoid therapy in IBD and other lifestyle factors. At a molecular level the proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to the intestinal immune response in IBD are known to enhance bone resorption. There are genes influencing osteoblast function and it is likely that LRP5 may be involved in the skeletal development. Also the identification of vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and some of its polymorphisms have led to consider the possible relationships between them and some autoimmune diseases and may be involved in the pathogenesis through the exertion of its immunomodulatory effects during inflammation. Trying to explain the physiopathology we have found that there is increasing evidence for the integration between systemic inflammation and bone loss likely mediated via receptor for activated nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK), RANK-ligand, and osteoprotegerin, proteins that can affect both osteoclastogenesis and T-cell activation. Although glucocorticoids can reduce mucosal and systemic inflammation, they have intrinsic qualities that negatively impact on bone mass. It is still controversial if all IBD patients should be screened, especially in patients with preexisting risk factors for bone disease. Available methods to measure BMD include single energy x-ray absorptiometry, DXA, quantitative computed tomography (QCT), radiographic absorptiometry, and ultrasound. DXA is the establish method to determine BMD, and routinely is measured in the hip and the lumbar spine. There are several treatments options that have proven their effectiveness, while new emergent therapies such as calcitonin and teriparatide among others remain to be assessed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Myoclonus is a sudden, abrupt, brief, 'shock-like' involuntary movement caused by muscular contractions ('positive myoclonus') or a sudden brief lapse of muscle contraction in active postural muscles ('negative myoclonus' or 'asterixis'). Various disorders can cause myoclonus including neurodegenerative and systemic metabolic disorders and CNS infections. In addition, myoclonus has been described as an adverse effect of some drugs. Level II evidence is available to indicate that levodopa, cyclic antidepressants and bismuth salts can cause myoclonus, while there is less robust evidence to associate numerous other drugs with the induction of myoclonus. The pharmacological mechanisms responsible for this adverse effect are not well established, although increased serotonergic transmission may be involved in the induction of myoclonus by several drugs. Drug-induced myoclonus usually resolves after withdrawal of the offending drug, but in some cases specific treatments are needed.\nDocument [2]: Title: Myoclonic disorders: a practical approach for diagnosis and treatment. Abstract: Myoclonus is a sudden, brief, involuntary muscle jerk. It is caused by abrupt muscle contraction, in the case of positive myoclonus, or by sudden cessation of ongoing muscular activity, in the case of negative myoclonus (NM). Myoclonus may be classified in a number of ways, although classification based on the underlying physiology is the most useful from the therapeutic viewpoint. Given the large number of possible causes of myoclonus, it is essential to take a good history, to clinically characterize myoclonus and to look for additional findings on examination in order to limit the list of possible investigations. With regards to the history, the age of onset, the character of myoclonus, precipitating or alleviating factors, family history and associated symptoms and signs are important. On examination, it is important to see whether the myoclonus appears at rest, on keeping posture or during action, to note the distribution of jerks and to look for the stimulus sensitivity. Electrophysiological tests are very helpful in determining whether myoclonus is cortical, subcortical or spinal. A single pharmacological agent rarely control myoclonus and therefore polytherapy with a combination of drugs, often in large dosages, is usually needed. Generally, antiepileptic drugs such as valproate, levetiracetam and piracetam are effective in cortical myoclonus, but less effective in other forms of myoclonus. Clonazepam may be helpful with all types of myoclonus. Focal and segmental myoclonus, irrespective of its origin, may be treated with botulinum toxin injections, with variable success.\nDocument [3]: Title: Myoclonus induced by salbutamol: A case report Abstract: Salbutamol is a \u03b22 adrenergic agonist widely prescribed in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. The main side effects associated with its use are tachycardia and tremor. Myoclonus is an involuntary, irregular, abrupt, brief and sudden muscular contraction, which can be generalized, focal or multifocal. We report the case of a 61-year-old patient presenting with myoclonus difficult to treat who showed improvement only after the definitive discontinuation of the \u03b22 adrenergic agonist. We describe the clinical findings, the interventions, and the outcomes related to the onset of myoclonus secondary to the use of salbutamol, as well as the possible genesis and importance of this adverse effect. We used the CARE guidelines to delineate the clinical case. Although myoclonus secondary to the use of different drugs has been described in the literature, as far as we know this is the fourth report of salbutamol-induced myoclonus to date.\nDocument [4]: Title: Myoclonus: current concepts and recent advances. Abstract: Myoclonus presents as a sudden brief jerk caused by involuntary muscle activity. An organisational framework is crucial for determining the medical significance of the myoclonus as well as for its treatment. Clinical presentations of myoclonus are divided into physiological, essential, epileptic, and symptomatic. Most causes of myoclonus are symptomatic and include posthypoxia, toxic-metabolic disorders, reactions to drugs, storage disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. The assessment of myoclonus includes an initial screening for those causes that are common or easily corrected. If needed, further testing may include clinical neurophysiological techniques, enzyme activities, tissue biopsy, and genetic testing. The motor cortex is the most commonly shown myoclonus source, but origins from subcortical areas, brainstem, spinal, and peripheral nervous system also occur. If treatment of the underlying disorder is not possible, treatment of symptoms is worthwhile, although limited by side-effects and a lack of controlled evidence.\nDocument [5]: Title: Treatment of myoclonus. Abstract: Myoclonus creates significant disability for patients. This symptom or sign can have many different etiologies, presentations, and pathophysiological mechanisms. A thorough evaluation for the myoclonus etiology is critical for developing a treatment strategy. The best etiological classification scheme is a modified version from that proposed by Marsden et al. in 1982. Clinical neurophysiology, as assessed by electromyography and electroencephalography, can be used to classify the pathophysiology of the myoclonus using a neurophysiology classification scheme. If the etiology of the myoclonus cannot be reversed or treated, then symptomatic treatment of the myoclonus itself may be warranted. Unfortunately, there are few controlled studies for myoclonus treatments. The treatment strategy for the myoclonus is best derived from the neurophysiology classification scheme categories: 1) cortical, 2) cortical-subcortical, 3) subcortical-nonsegmental, 4) segmental, and 5) peripheral. A cortical physiology classification is most common. Levetiracetam is suggested as first-line treatment for cortical myoclonus, but valproic acid and clonazepam are commonly used. Cortical-subcortical myoclonus is the physiology demonstrated by myoclonic seizures, such as in primary epileptic myoclonus (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). Valproic acid has demonstrated efficacy in such epileptic syndromes with other medications providing an adjunctive role. Clonazepam is used for subcortical-nonsegmental myoclonus, but other treatments, depending on the syndrome, have been used for this physiological type of myoclonus. Segmental myoclonus is difficult to treat, but clonazepam and botulinum toxin are used. Botulinum toxin is used for focal examples of peripheral myoclonus. Myoclonus treatment is commonly not effective and/or limited by side effects.\nDocument [6]: Title: Reversible tremor and myoclonus associated with topiramate-fluvoxamine coadministration. Abstract: The antiepileptic agent topiramate has proved its efficacy in a variety of other conditions as well, including several kinds of tremor and migraine prophylaxis. We report on the case of a 42-year-old depressive female patient with comorbid migraine attacks, whereby the adjunction of topiramate as an antimigraine agent at the dosage of 50 mg/d to her antidepressive treatment with fluvoxamine at 300 mg/d triggered--the prima facie paradoxical for topiramate--side effects of tremor and myoclonus. Topiramate was immediately discontinued, and patient's abnormal movements subsided completely within 24 to 72 hours. Topiramate was possibly the cause of patient's abnormal movements enhanced by fluvoxamine's potential to induce also tremor and myoclonus. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the potentially severe adverse reactions that might occur during concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine and topiramate.\nDocument [7]: Title: An Italian multicentre study of perampanel in progressive myoclonus epilepsies. Abstract: Perampanel (PER) is a novel anti-seizure medication useful in different types of epilepsy. We intended to assess the effectiveness of PER on cortical myoclonus and seizure frequency in patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), using quantitative validated scales. Forty-nine patients aged 36.6 \u00b1 15.6 years with PME of various aetiology (18 EPM1, 12 EPM2, five with sialidosis, one with Kufs disease, one with EPM7, and 12 undetermined) were enrolled between January 2017 and June 2018. PER at the dose of 2-12 mg (5.3 \u00b1 2.5) was added to existing therapy. Myoclonus severity was assessed using a minimal myoclonus scale (MMS) in all the patients before and after 4-6 months of steady PER dose, and by means of the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS) in 20 patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors potentially predicting treatment efficacy. Four patients dropped out in the first two months due to psychiatric side effects. In the remaining patients, PER reduced myoclonus severity as assessed using MMS (Wilcoxon test: p < 0.001) and UMRS (p < 0.001), with the 'Action myoclonus' section of the UMRS showing the greatest improvement. The patients with EPM1 or EPM1-like phenotype were more likely to improve with PER (p = 0.011). Convulsive seizures which have recurred at least monthly in 17 patients were reduced by >50%. Side effects occurred in 22/49 (44.8%) patients, the most common being irritability followed by drowsiness. PER is effective in treating myoclonus and seizures in PME patients. The frequency of psychiatric side effects suggests the need for careful patient monitoring.\nDocument [8]: Title: Physiology-Based Treatment of Myoclonus. Abstract: Myoclonus can cause significant disability for patients. Myoclonus has a strikingly diverse array of underlying etiologies, clinical presentations, and pathophysiological mechanisms. Treatment of myoclonus is vital to improving the quality of life of patients with these disorders. The optimal treatment strategy for myoclonus is best determined based upon careful evaluation and consideration of the underlying etiology and neurophysiological classification. Electrophysiological testing including EEG (electroencephalogram) and EMG (electromyogram) data is helpful in determining the neurophysiological classification of myoclonus. The neurophysiological subtypes of myoclonus include cortical, cortical-subcortical, subcortical-nonsegmental, segmental, and peripheral. Levetiracetam, valproic acid, and clonazepam are often used to treat cortical myoclonus. In cortical-subcortical myoclonus, treatment of myoclonic seizures is prioritized, valproic acid being the mainstay of therapy. Subcortical-nonsegmental myoclonus may be treated with clonazepam, though numerous agents have been used depending on the etiology. Segmental and peripheral myoclonus are often resistant to treatment, but anticonvulsants and botulinum toxin injections may be of utility depending upon the case. Pharmacological treatments are often hampered by scarce evidence-based knowledge, adverse effects, and variable efficacy of medications.\nDocument [9]: Title: Encephalopathy and myoclonus triggered by valproic acid. Abstract: In recent years, the use of valproic acid (VPA) as a mood-stabilizing agent has continuously increased. Although VPA usually is well tolerated, its use in combination with other psychotropic compounds might bear an elevated risk of adverse reactions. Here, we present the case of a 42-year-old male suffering from treatment-resistant psychotic depression, who was prescribed VPA additionally to lithium, clomipramine, flupentixol and risperidone. By doing so, he developed myoclonus, tremor and encephalopathy with sedation and marked EEG background slowing. Most notably, these side effects occurred in the presence of normal VPA and ammonia serum concentrations. On VPA discontinuation, all symptoms vanished and EEG normalized. We thus suggest that direct VPA-induced encephalopathy in the absence of ammonemia does exist, in this case probably facilitated by psychotropic polypharmacy.\nDocument [10]: Title: Side effects of clozapine and some other psychoactive drugs. Abstract: The recognition, management, and if possible prevention, of major cardiovascular, central nervous system, haematological, and metabolic adverse effects, including diabetes mellitus and weight gain, of antipsychotics and some other drugs used to treat mental illness is a topic of much debate. However, a wide range of other adverse effects, some of which may be life-threatening, may also be encountered. Side-effects reviewed here include: gastrointestinal-associated effects (constipation, hypersalivation, oropharyngeal lesions, nasal congestion, nausea, nocturnal enuresis, and urinary retention), metabolic effects (obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypertension), neuromuscular effects (extrapyramidal side effects, myoclonus, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and pleurothotonus), thermoregulatory effects, effects on the liver, pancreas, and kidney, sexual side effects, and effects on skin and bone. Metabolic factors affecting the incidence of adverse effects to clozapine especially are also discussed. The increasing use of atypical (second generation) antipsychotics and indeed of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has led to a greater appreciation of not only the benefits of these drugs, but also of the spectrum of toxicity that may occur in clinical practice. The adverse effects of antipsychotics are a major factor in promoting poor adherence to, and even discontinuation of, antipsychotic treatment on the one hand, and increasing the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease on the other. As such they merit recognition and either harm minimization strategies (use of the minimum effective dose, or use of lower doses of combinations of antipsychotics), or in extreme cases discontinuation of the offending drug(s).\nDocument [11]: Title: Gabapentin-induced Facial Myoclonus in the Setting of Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease. Abstract: An 82-year-old male with chronic kidney disease presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of left sided facial myoclonus. Myoclonus is a rare, but known side effect of gabapentin; however, there does not appear to be documented cases of gabapentin-induced facial myoclonus described in the emergency medicine literature. This case discusses the emergency department evaluation and inpatient treatment of gabapentin-induced facial myoclonus in the setting of acute on chronic kidney disease. Though rare, side effects of gabapentin should remain on a broad differential diagnosis in patients taking the medication who present with myoclonus, especially in the setting of chronic kidney disease.\nDocument [12]: Title: Parkinsonism & related disorders. Myoclonus. Abstract: Myoclonus has now been recognized to have many possible etiologies, anatomical sources, and pathophysiologic features. Classification schemes may be based on clinical syndromes and etiology, neurophysiology properties, or exam findings. In recent years, many myoclonus case reports and short series have been published. However, this article will group new developments into three areas: (1) Myoclonus in parkinsonian disorders, (2) Concepts in myoclonus generation, and (3) Treatment. Current findings do not allow one to conclude whether or how parkinsonism contributes to the myoclonus mechanism in parkinsonian disorders. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the myoclonus in Lewy body disorders is mostly caused by abnormal basal ganglia input to motor areas of the neocortex. The exact source of cortical myoclonus generation is controversial. Increased corticomuscular coherence represents a robust phenomenon that will need to be explained by any model that offers a putative explanation for cortical myoclonus generation. Myoclonus treatment is still limited, and more research on basic mechanisms before truly effective treatment will be available. The best approach for myoclonus is based on the physiological classification of the myoclonus.\nDocument [13]: Title: Myoclonus: Pathophysiology and Treatment Options. Abstract: Treatment of myoclonus requires an understanding of the physiopathology of the condition. The first step in treatment is to determine if there is an epileptic component to the myoclonus and treat accordingly. Secondly, a review of medications (e.g., opiates) and comorbidities (e.g., hepatic or renal failure) is required to establish the possibility of iatrogenic and reversible conditions. Once those are eliminated, delineation between cortical, cortico-subcortical, subcortical, brainstem, and spinal generators can determine the first-line treatment. Cortical myoclonus can be treated with levetiracetam, valproic acid, and clonazepam as first-line agents. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may paradoxically worsen myoclonus. Subcortical and brainstem myoclonus can be treated with clonazepam as a first-line agent, but levetiracetam and valproic acid can be tried as well. L-5-Hydroxytryptophan and sodium oxybate are agents used for refractory cases. Spinal myoclonus does not respond to anti-epileptic drugs, and clonazepam is a first-line agent. Botulinum toxin treatment can be useful for focal cases of spinal myoclonus. The etiology of propriospinal myoclonus is controversial, and a functional etiology is suspected in most cases. Treatment can include clonazepam, levetiracetam, baclofen, valproate, carbamazepine, and zonisamide. Functional myoclonus requires multimodal and multidisciplinary treatment that may include psychotropic drugs and physical and occupational therapy. Close collaboration between neurologists and psychiatrists is required for effective treatment. Finally, deep brain stimulation targeting the globus pallidus pars-interna bilaterally has been used in myoclonus-dystonia when pharmacological treatments have been exhausted.\nDocument [14]: Title: Myoclonus induced by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Abstract: \u2022We present a patient in whom myoclonus appeared after initiation of treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.\u2022Myoclonus and EEG abnormalities disappeared after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment.\u2022This possible adverse effect should be considered to avoid performing aggressive therapeutic maneuvers.\nDocument [15]: Title: Hemicrania continua: Indomethacin induced myoclonus. Abstract: Myoclonus has been described rarely as an adverse effect with some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but never with indomethacin. Indomethacin is a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for various primary headache disorders, including hemicrania continua. We present a rare case of a 45-year-old male with hemicrania continua who developed myoclonus from indomethacin. These movements resolved completely following discontinuation of indomethacin. The disturbance on the serotonergic and GABAergic systems may be associated with indomethacin induced myoclonus. Clinicians and patients should be mindful with this potential side effect with indomethacin.\nDocument [16]: Title: Gabapentin or pregabalin induced myoclonus: A case series and literature review. Abstract: Gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB) are FDA approved for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures and for treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. Both drugs are primarily eliminated by renal excretion. However, PGB or GBP induced myoclonus has only been reported infrequently in case reports/series. It is not discussed with patients and its sudden occurrence can lead to anxiety because of \"seizure-like\" nature. In addition, first-contact physicians might treat it as seizures, leading to unnecessary tests and aggressive management. Medical records of patients who had myoclonus because of PGB or GBP seen by Neurology service between Jan & May 2017 in inpatient or outpatient setting at our tertiary care setting were reviewed. We identified six patients who were on either GBP or PGB or both who developed likely subcortical myoclonus in the setting of renal insufficiency and one patient who developed myoclonus independent of renal dysfunction. Our results indicate that myoclonus is commonly seen in patients in various clinical settings with or without renal insufficiency, and is independent of the severity of the renal failure. However, this is a reversible side effect of medication and it resolves either by discontinuing the medication, removing the medication with hemodialysis or by improvement of renal dysfunction. With a high index of suspicion, aggressive testing and treatment for other possible conditions like seizures (in non-epilepsy patients) or CNS infections can be avoided. In patients with renal failure and with decreased physiological renal clearance such as the elderly, GBP or PGB dose initiation and changes should be conservative.\nDocument [17]: Title: Myoclonus- A Review. Abstract: Myoclonus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by a sudden, brief, involuntary jerk. Positive myoclonus is caused by abrupt muscle contractions, while negative myoclonus by sudden cessation of ongoing muscular contractions. Myoclonus can be classified in various ways according to body distribution, relation to activity, neurophysiology, and etiology. The neurophysiological classification of myoclonus by means of electrophysiological tests is helpful in guiding the best therapeutic strategy. Given the diverse etiologies of myoclonus, a thorough history and detailed physical examination are key to the evaluation of myoclonus. These along with basic laboratory testing and neurophysiological studies help in narrowing down the clinical possibilities. Though symptomatic treatment is required in the majority of cases, treatment of the underlying etiology should be the primary aim whenever possible. Symptomatic treatment is often not satisfactory, and a combination of different drugs is often required to control the myoclonus. This review addresses the etiology, classification, clinical approach, and management of myoclonus.\nDocument [18]: Title: An Update on Myoclonus Management. Abstract: Myoclonus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by sudden, brief, lightning-like involuntary jerks. There are many possible causes of myoclonus and both the etiology and characteristics of the myoclonus are important in securing the diagnosis and treatment. Myoclonus may be challenging to treat, as it frequently requires multiple medications for acceptable results. Few randomized controlled trials investigating the optimal treatment for myoclonus are available, and expert experience and case series guide treatment. Areas Covered: In this article, the authors review the basics of myoclonus and its classification. The authors discuss the current management of myoclonus and then focus on recent updates in the literature, including both pharmacologic and surgical options. Expert opinion: Myoclonus remains a challenge to manage, and there is a paucity of rigorous clinical trials guiding treatment paradigms. Furthermore, due to the etiological heterogeneity of myoclonus, defining the appropriate scope for high-quality clinical trials is challenging. In order to advance the field, the myoclonus study group needs to be revived in the US and abroad so that interested investigators can collaborate on multicenter clinical trials for myoclonus treatments.\nDocument [19]: Title: [Zonisamide treatment in myoclonus-dystonia]. Abstract: Myoclonus-dystonia (DYT11) is a rare, autosomal dominant hereditary disorder clinically characterized by myoclonus and/or dystonia. The disease is most commonly caused by the mutations of the <i>SGCE</i> gene. Causative therapy is not available currently. Regarding symptomatic treatment, zonisamide, insulin therapy, carbamazepine and zolpidem may be utilized. If these drugs are not effective, bilateral globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation may come into consideration. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of zonisamide treatment in a Hungarian patient with genetically proven myoclonus-dystonia. Our 25-year-old female patient has had jerky, lightning-like movements since her childhood, mainly localized to her right upper limb. In addition, muscle cramps associated with writing and walking were also present. The symptoms were reduced by alcohol consumption. Brain MRI did not show any abnormality. Neurophysiological studies raised the possibility of subcortical myoclonus. After detailed phenotyping, genetic testing was performed, yielding the diagnosis of myoclonus-dystonia. A heterozygous mutation in the 6th exon of the <i>SGCE</i> gene at the position 709, resulting in an early stop codon (c.709C&gt; T, p.Arg237*) was demonstrated. After considering the risk-benefit ratio, we decided to start zonisamide treatment. The dose was titrated gradually to 300 mg/d over 6 weeks. Myoclonus- and dystonia-specific tests demonstrated significant improvement compared to the pre-treatment status. The aim of this case report is to draw attention to this rare condition, its treatment and the importance of collaboration between medical subspecialties.

Abstract: Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome is one of a few corticotropin (ACTH)-responsive central nervous system disorders of childhood. We measured cerebrospinal fluid ACTH and cortisol in 69 children with opsoclonus-myoclonus and 25 age- and sex-matched control subjects to determine endogenous levels and look for hypothesized differential hormonal effects of ACTH and corticosteroid treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid cortisol was 10-fold higher with ACTH treatment (n = 26), but was unchanged with oral steroid treatment (n = 18) or no treatment (n = 25). It was significantly higher in children receiving daily high-dose ACTH than alternate day ACTH. In ACTH-treated children, cerebrospinal fluid and serum cortisol were highly correlated (r = 0.96, P = 0.0001), with a mean ratio of cerebrospinal fluid to serum cortisol of approximately 1:10. Cerebrospinal fluid ACTH concentration did not differ significantly between untreated opsoclonus-myoclonus and control subjects but was lower with ACTH (-29%) or steroid treatment (-36%), suggesting feedback inhibition of ACTH release. These data delineate differences in the central effects of ACTH and corticosteroid therapy, as well as between high and low ACTH doses, and support the integrity of the brain-adrenal axis in pediatric opsoclonus-myoclonus.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Tumors arising from burn scars are not rare but sometimes cause the rare co-existence of different tumors. However, detailed information on this topic remains largely unknown. We present a case of the co-occurrence of malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma in a patient with a history of burn scars. A 73-year-old man presented with an erythematous plaque on his left lower leg that gradually turned into a tumor with ulceration. He also presented with scaly tumors at other sites within the same burn scar lesion. He had a history of burns on the left leg at the age of 20 years. After surgical resection of the tumors, histological analysis revealed that the posterior aspect of the largest tumor was malignant melanoma, and the remaining two tumors were squamous cell carcinomas, indicating the co-existence of different types of malignant skin cancers. Based on a literature review of previously published case reports, this is the first report to highlight the importance of complete skin grafts in reducing this risk.\nDocument [2]: Title: Tinea corporis gladiatorum presenting as a majocchi granuloma. Abstract: Background. Wrestlers are at increased risk of developing cutaneous infections, including fungal infections caused by dermatophytes. Erythematous lesions due to tinea infections can be mistakenly diagnosed as an inflammatory dermatitis and incorrectly treated with potent topical corticosteroid treatments which cause localized skin immunosuppression. This can eventuate in a Majocchi granuloma which then becomes refractory to topical antifungal therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case of tinea corporis gladiatorum presenting as a Majocchi granuloma. Observations. A 20-year-old wrestler presented with a 4-year history of a large pruritic, scaly erythematous plaque with follicular papules, and pustules on his right forearm. The lesion had the clinical appearance of a Majocchi granuloma. He had been treated with potent topical corticosteroids and topical antifungal therapy. KOH and fungal culture of the lesion were negative. An erythematous scaly lesion in the scalp was cultured and grew Trichophyton tonsurans. Oral Terbinafine therapy was initiated and complete resolution of both lesions occurred within 6 weeks. Conclusion. The purpose of this report is to inform dermatologists that tinea corporis gladiatorum can present as a Majocchi granuloma and needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent skin lesions in wrestlers.\nDocument [3]: Title: Unknown: Bluish-gray macules on the hands of a healthy 34 year-old man. Abstract: A 34 year-old man presented with asymptomatic bluish-gray macules on his hands that had developed over the previous 2 years. He was otherwise healthy and was on no regular medication. A detailed clinical history and histologic examination allowed the diagnosis.Histopathologic examination showed deposits of aggregated granules of black pigment in the dermis, localized preferentially around the sweat glands. This was consistent with the deposition of silver salts. Given the absence of systemic complaints or other signs and symptoms, a conservative approach was adopted. The lesions remain unchanged after one year of follow up.The wide range of uses for silver allows exposure to its compounds (metal, soluble and insoluble compounds) through different routes of entry, namely direct contact, ingestion, inhalation, and puncture. [1] This exposure is usually occupational, iatrogenic, or accidental. [1] Argyria is an exceedingly rare disease that became uncommon because medications containing silver are no longer used and occupational protection has evolved significantly. [2] It is caused by the deposition of silver grains in the skin and is further divided into localized and generalized forms, according to the route of entry. [1-4] Localized argyria is caused by direct contact with silver (the tiny particles penetrate the skin through the sweat glands) or puncture. [1, 3, 4] These deposits remain indefinitely in the skin and are characterized by a bluish gray color, more prominent in the photo-exposed areas. [3, 4] In the localized forms, patients usually don't have systemic symptoms and the problem is cosmetic. [1-4] Given the improvement in the safety of working conditions, occupational argyria cases are becoming quite uncommon. [1-4].\nDocument [4]: Title: Isolated linear blaschkoid psoriasis. Abstract: Linear psoriasis (LPs) is considered a rare clinical presentation of psoriasis, which is characterized by linear erythematous and scaly lesions along the lines of Blaschko. We report the case of a 20-year-old man who presented with asymptomatic linear and S-shaped erythematous, scaly plaques on right side of his trunk. The plaques were arranged along the lines of Blaschko with a sharp demarcation at the midline. Histological examination of a skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of psoriasis. Topical calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate ointments were prescribed for 2 months. A good clinical improvement was achieved, with reduction in lesion thickness and scaling. In patients with linear erythematous and scaly plaques along the lines of Blaschko, the diagnosis of LPs should be kept in mind, especially in patients with asymptomatic lesions of late onset.\nDocument [5]: Title: Enlarging Bump on the Scrotum. Abstract: Extramammary Paget disease is a rare, slow-growing intraepithelial neoplasm of the skin or its underlying appendages. It more commonly affects the apocrine glands of the axilla, vulva, perianal region, scrotum, and/or penis. It often presents as a well-demarcated, thickened, erythematous, or gray-white scaly plaque with indolent growth that may become ulcerated, crusted, papillomatous, or eczematous over time. Pruritus, pain, and burning sensations are common symptoms; however, they are not appreciated by all patients. Many patients are erroneously treated for eczema for months to years before a proper diagnosis is reached. Patients presenting with chronic genital or perineal dermatitis or skin lesions that have been unresponsive to topical therapy should be biopsied for definitive diagnosis.\nDocument [6]: Title: Unusual Paraneoplastic Presentation of Cholangiocarcinoma. Abstract: Introduction. Cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of skin manifestations that occur in relation to many known malignancies. Paraneoplastic occurrence of SCLE has been noted but is not commonly reported. SCLE association with cholangiocarcinoma is rare. Case Presentation. A 72-year-old man with a history of extrahepatic stage IV cholangiocarcinoma presented with a pruritic rash. Cholangiocarcinoma had been diagnosed three years earlier and was treated. Five months after interruption of his chemotherapy due to a semiurgent surgery, he presented with explosive onset of a new pruritic rash, arthralgias, and lower extremity edema. Physical exam revealed a scaly erythematous rash on his arms, hands, face, neck, legs, and trunk. It was thick and scaly on sun exposed areas. Skin biopsy revealed vacuolar interface dermatitis. Immunofluorescence revealed IgM positive cytoid bodies scattered along the epidermal basement membrane zone. PET-CT scanning revealed metabolically active recurrent disease in peripancreatic and periportal region with hypermetabolic lymph nodes. Oral steroids and new regimen of chemotherapy were started. Rash improved and steroids were tapered off. Discussion. Paraneoplastic syndromes demonstrate the complex interaction between the immune system and cancer. Treatment resistant SCLE should raise a suspicion for paraneoplastic etiology.\nDocument [7]: Title: Skin Biter: Dermatodaxia Revisited. Abstract: Dermatodaxia describes humans who bite their skin. Previously used designations, which are less appropriate, have included chewing pads, wolf-biter, and dermatophagia. Dermatodaxia is a body-focused repetitive behavior and is classified in the category of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. People who bite their skin may concurrently have other related disorders such as dermatillomania (also referred to as skin picking) affecting their cutaneous integument, trichotillomania (also referred to as hair-pulling) affecting their hair, and/or onychophagia (also referred to as nail-biting) affecting their nails. A man with multiple medical conditions presented for follow-up evaluation of a recently treated superficial skin infection of his abdomen. Cutaneous examination not only showed complete resolution of an abdominal abscess but also dermatodaxia involving his dorsal left index finger; the skin biting site appeared as an asymptomatic lichenified nodule with overlying scaly hyperkeratosis. Additional inquiry confirmed that for several decades he would repeatedly bite this finger. He was aware - and even demonstrated - that his skin biting caused the lesion. He also declined any interventions to alter his behavior. Similar to the patient in this report, dermatodaxia typically presents as an asymptomatic, unilateral, solitary, lichenified, callous-like, thick nodule; however, bilateral involvement or multiple biting sites or both may occur. Lesions typically occur on the forearm, hands, and fingers; on the latter site, they may or may not involve the knuckles. Physical modalities, behavior modifications, and/or pharmacologic agents may be used in the management of dermatodaxia; however, many individuals with dermatodaxia - similar to the reported man - are not only aware that the cutaneous lesion is caused by their skin biting but also do not want to entertain the possibility of initiating any intervention that might change or stop their skin biting.\nDocument [8]: Title: Adalimumab for the treatment of pityriasis rubra pilaris: a case report. Abstract: Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a chronic papulosquamous eruption of the skin characterized by follicular hyperkeratosis, salmon pink scaly plaques with islands of unaffected skin, and palmoplantar keratoderma. Widely used oral systemic and topical treatments are not greatly effective. We present a 62-year-old man with PRP of 2 years' duration who used routine topical treatments, oral retinoids, and UV therapy without improvement, but his symptoms greatly improved with the initiation of adalimumab.\nDocument [9]: Title: Undesirable repigmentation in vitiligo patient receiving methotrexate therapy for the treatment of psoriasis: treatment or side effect? Abstract: Vitiligo is an acquired skin depigmentation disorder related to the destruction of melanocytes. There are a limited number of case reports and studies in current literature that show methotrexate (MTX) is effective in the treatment. A 44-year-old man presented to our clinic with a one-year history of psoriasis. On dermatological examination, there were erythematous, scaly papules and plaques on knees, elbows, gluteal area, and scalp compatible with psoriasis. In addition there was total depigmentation over the body. He had a 30-year history of vitiligo, beginning localized but progressed gradually and covered the entire body surface. Subcutaneous methotrexate 10mg weekly was started for psoriasis. On the 6th week of methotrexate treatment, he presented to our clinic with newly developed brown macules on his face. The result of the punch biopsy taken from a macule was reported as normal skin findings. Because his body was fully depigmented, his brown melanocytic macules on his face were considered as repigmentation associated with MTX treatment. His MTX treatment was stopped by patient request. On his 6-month follow-up, hypopigmentation was observed at prior repigmented macules. Methotrexate can be considered an alternative treatment for vitiligo patients when topical therapy and phototherapy are ineffective or not applicable.\nDocument [10]: Title: Keratosis lichenoides chronica in an Indian child following erythroderma. Abstract: A 4-year-old boy presented with mildly itchy, linear, skin lesions over the trunk, arms, and face of 3 months' duration. He had previously been admitted to a private hospital for generalized exfoliation of the skin following drug intake for fever and throat pain. The nature of the drugs was not known. The exfoliative dermatitis was treated with oral prednisolone, 10 mg daily, tapered over 3 weeks. No further topical or oral medication was given. The present skin lesions started 1 month after the cessation of the steroids. There was no family history of skin lesions, voice changes, or systemic complaints. Cutaneous examination showed multiple violaceous, linear, reticulate ridges with adherent scaling over the chest, back, and neck. There were scaly, flat-topped papules over the extensor aspects of both upper arms and the buttocks, and scaly plaques over the cheeks (Figs 1a-d and 2a,b). The scalp showed diffuse greasy scaling. There were no oral, genital, axillary, or eye lesions. The nails were normal. Systemic examination did not reveal any abnormal finding. Routine hematologic investigations, liver and kidney function tests, tests for hepatitis B and C, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIV were normal. Histopathology from skin lesions on the back revealed hyperkeratosis, patchy parakeratosis, follicular plugging, alternating irregular acanthosis and epidermal thinning, basal cell degeneration, and a band-like inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and a few plasma cells (Fig. 3). Based on the classical clinical features and histopathology, keratosis lichenoides chronica was diagnosed, and topical 1% hydrocortisone acetate cream, twice daily, was prescribed. There was slight relief of pruritus at a follow-up visit after 3 weeks; however, the patient was subsequently lost to follow-up.\nDocument [11]: Title: Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis demonstrating small, discrete skin-colored papules. Abstract: We report the case of a 67-year-old female with a rare variant of interstitial granulomatous dermatitis showing multiple skin-colored papules. Clinically, numerous skin-colored or reddish papules were distributed on her back and posterior thighs with itchy scaly erythema on the upper back. After topical steroid application, skin-colored papules still remained after the disappearance of itchy scaly erythema. Histopathologically, perivascular and interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes with occasional multinucleated giant cells were observed in the superficial and mid reticular dermis, accompanied by mild mucin deposition. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is similar to interstitial granuloma annulare, but can be differentiated from it by lesser degrees of collagen degeneration with mucin deposition and frequent association with arthritis or rheumatic diseases. As previously reported, multiple asymptomatic skin-colored papules are considered a rare but distinct variant of interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. Although no apparent underlying disorder has developed in the presented case, careful follow-up needs to be continued.\nDocument [12]: Title: Granuloma Annulare Skin Lesions in a Case of Sarcoidosis. Abstract: We report the case of a 32-year- old man with a short 3-week history of erythematous, annular, non scaly plaques on palmar and dorsal aspect of his hands, who was concurrently diagnosed as a case of sarcoidosis on the basis of findings of generalized lymphadenopathy and radiological and histological features of pulmonary sarcoidosis. His skin biopsy was consistent with the diagnosis of granuloma annulare. Sarcoidosis and granuloma annulare are two separate diseases, which involve the skin and have a mononuclear histiocytic cellular reaction, although their aetiology is still unknown. Granuloma annulare has been associated with the concomitant diagnosis of sarcoidosis in only two more case reports and this association can be evaluated further to study a common link in the aetipathogenesis of these two granulomatous skin diseases.\nDocument [13]: Title: Infliximab-Induced Aseptic Meningitis during the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis. Abstract: A 42-year-old Japanese man presented with persistent headache during treatment for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) with infliximab. Treatment with infliximab was initiated 3 years before and the psoriatic skin lesions with arthritis were well controlled. However, after 21 doses of infliximab, the skin lesions and joint pain exacerbated and became intractable. Ten days after the dosage of infliximab was increased, the patient experienced headache and nausea with high fever. He had scaly, well-circumscribed erythemas on his trunk, extremities, and deformed nails. He also had swelling and pain in multiple joints. His complete blood and differential leukocyte counts were normal. The level of C-reactive protein was 16.66 mg/dL, whereas anti-infliximab antibodies were absent. Nuchal rigidity was absent and there were no abnormal neurological findings; however, jolt test results were positive. Results from magnetic resonance imaging were normal, whereas those from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination were almost normal. The CSF contained mononuclear cells and was negative for bacteriological cultures, India ink staining, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of herpesvirus group DNA. Headache and nausea improved 2 months after infliximab was discontinued. The patient failed to respond to infliximab treatment for PsA, and we diagnosed infliximab-induced aseptic meningitis. Infliximab was discontinued and treatment with ustekinumab and methotrexate was initiated. Thereafter, the psoriatic skin lesion and joint pain gradually improved. Infliximab-induced aseptic meningitis may be a differential diagnosis when symptoms of meningitis develop during infliximab administration.\nDocument [14]: Title: Crusted scabies in a patient with brain astrocytoma: report of a case. Abstract: A 31-year-old man was referred to our clinic complaining of generalized erythematous and scaly papules and plaques. He suffered from a brain tumor (astrocytoma) and was immunosuppressed because he was receiving systemic steroids and chemo-radiation therapy. He also had psychomotor retardation and behavior changes due to the pressure effect of his brain tumor. The diagnosis of crusted scabies was established based on direct positive skin smears from the lesions.\nDocument [15]: Title: Bilateral scaly plaques in axillae: pityriasis rosea of Vidal. Abstract: A 32-year-old man was referred for acute onset of pruritic scaly eruptions in the axillae of 8 days' duration, which was unresponsive to topical clotrimazole. The lesions consisted of multiple, coalescent oval plaques of 1 cm to 6 cm in longest diameter (Figure 1 and Figure 2) with central clearing and typical collarette scales at the periphery (Figure 3). Other skin areas and mucosal surfaces were unaffected. His general and systemic examinations were normal. Family and past histories were unremarkable except for a \"ring worm-like patch\" on his lower aspect of the abdomen 4 months ago, which rapidly regressed. On further inquiry, he gave a history of an episode of fever, coryza, and headache 3 weeks earlier to his eruption on the abdomen, which resolved with conservative remedies and one paracetamol tablet. He remained asymptomatic until axillary lesions appeared. We made a provisional diagnosis of pityriasis rosea (PR). Investigations including scrapings for potassium hydroxide examination, complete blood cell counts, urinalysis, blood sugar, VDRL test, and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies were all normal or non-reactive. As cutaneous biopsy revealed parakeratosis, epidermal spongiosis, dermal inflammatory cells, and extravasated red blood cells (Figure 4). The eruptions cleared within 8 days, following treatment with mometasone furoate cream and oral desloratidine 5 mg/d, leaving post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. There was no recurrence for the next 6 months of observation. He was later lost to follow-up.\nDocument [16]: Title: Acquired Ichthyosis in the Setting of Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Abstract: Acquired ichthyosis is an uncommon disorder of cornification. It characteristically presents as symmetric scaling of the skin on the trunk and extensor surfaces of the extremities. It is clinically and histologically similar to ichthyosis vulgaris; however, acquired ichthyosis develops later in life and has been associated with various malignancies, infections, medications, autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders, and malnutrition. We describe a case of a 35-year-old woman with active pulmonary tuberculosis and a history of breast cancer who presented with a several-month history of a widespread, scaly, pruritic skin eruption. Physical examination revealed fine, scaly patches on the extremities with relative sparing of the flexures and larger, scaly, ichthyosiform patches on the chest and back. Skin biopsy revealed orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis and a diminished granular layer, consistent with a diagnosis of acquired ichthyosis. Further evaluation, including positron-emission tomography/computed tomography scan, revealed hypermetabolic infiltrates and cavitation in the lungs, consistent with active pulmonary tuberculosis; there was no evidence of new or recurrent malignancy. The patient was treated with antituberculosis drugs and topical ammonium lactate cream. With incident cases rarely reported in the literature, this case of new-onset ichthyosis in the setting of active pulmonary tuberculosis highlights the distinctive clinical and histologic features of acquired ichthyosis and emphasizes the relationship of acquired ichthyosis with underlying systemic disease, particularly infection.\nDocument [17]: Title: Mycosis fungoides in a hemodialysis patient with intractable pruritus. Abstract: A 69-year-old Japanese man developed pruritus 3 years after beginning hemodialysis. Although eczema was not apparent at first, erythematous patches and plaques developed gradually on the affected skin. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was considered to be a main cause of this patient's pruritus, but skin lesions worsened even after parathyroidectomy had markedly decreased parathyroid hormone concentrations. Two months later, he developed an antibiotic-refractory fever of unknown origin and cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Elevations of soluble interleukin-2 receptor with 7410 U/mL and IgE with 24 600 U/mL in serum were noted, as was eosinophilia. The skin showed multiple slightly scaly patches and infiltrative plaques, which were reddish brown and distributed widely over the body surface except for the scalp and face. Mycosis fungoides, a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, was diagnosed from biopsy specimens findings in skin and lymph node. Mycosis fungoides has not been documented as a cause of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. However, if skin lesions steadily worsen in hemodialysis patients, malignant diseases such as mycosis fungoides should be considered.\nDocument [18]: Title: Relapsing <i>Helicobacter cinaedi</i> Cellulitis without Bacteremia in a Patient with X-linked Agammaglobulinemia after 1 Year of Antibiotic Prophylaxis. Abstract: A 23-year-old man with Bruton's X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), who required intravenous immunoglobulin G (IgG) every 3 weeks, presented with an erythematous scaly eruption adjacent to the chest port for antibiotic therapy (Figures 1A,B). His past medical history included <i>Helicobacter cinaedi</i> cellulitis in 2015 that was treated with intravenous vancomycin and ertapenem with no improvement after several months. The therapy was switched to ertapenem and amikacin, which was also unsuccessful after 1 year. Subsequently, on switching to oral doxycycline for 6 months, he had a 2-year period without skin lesions. He presented to Mount Sinai Hospital in 2019 with 2-day fever and newly appearing skin lesions.

Abstract: Prurigo pigmentosa (PP) is an idiopathic cutaneous inflammatory disorder. Here we report a 50-year-old healthy male of Arabic descent who presented with a six-month history of very itchy persistent skin lesions on his back. Skin examination revealed multiple brownish non-scaly excoriated papules and patches in the midline of his lower back. The differential diagnosis includes lichen planus (LP), confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP), and PP. Skin biopsy revealed acanthosis, spongiosis, and dyskeratotic keratinocytes in the epidermis. The dermis showed mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Based on the previous clinicopathological findings, the patient was diagnosed with PP. He was prescribed doxycycline 100 mg once daily (OD) for two months. Two months after treatment, all lesions disappeared completely. After one year at the follow-up, he presented with a recurrence of the same skin lesions at the same site. We restarted him on doxycycline treatment.\nDocument [20]: Title: Ingestion of Coffee Polyphenols Improves a Scaly Skin Surface and the Recovery Rate of Skin Temperature after Cold Stress: A Randomized, Controlled Trial. Abstract: Coffee polyphenols (CPPs) derived from coffee beans have beneficial effects on blood pressure and vascular endothelial function. In addition, CPPs suppress ultraviolet light induced erythema. However, the effects of CPPs on dry skin and cutaneous vascular function have not been clarified. We investigated the effects of CPPs on dry skin and the recovery rate (RR) of skin temperature after a cold-stress test as a measure of vascular function in subjects with visible scaliness in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. The subjects were divided into two groups, the CPP group and the Placebo group. In the CPP group, the subjects ingested a beverage containing 297.8 mg CPPs every day for 4 wk. The degree of skin dryness was assessed quantitatively using a Visioscan to evaluate skin scaliness and smoothness. A subjective evaluation using a visual analog scale (VAS) of skin smoothness was also used. As a result, the scaliness and smoothness of cheek skin was significantly improved after 4 wk in the CPP group compared to the Placebo group. The improvements of the VAS score on 'skin smoothness' and the RR were also observed in the CPP group but the difference was not statistically significant. However, when the CPP group was divided into subgroups of high RR and low RR, the improvement of the RR was significant in the low RR subgroup. In conclusion, our results suggest that CPPs improve skin scaliness and play a role in cutaneous blood flow regulation after cold stress.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Spontaneous regression of herniated lumbar discs was reported occasionally. The mechanisms proposed for regression of disc herniation are still incomplete. This paper describes and discusses a case of spontaneous regression of herniated lumbar discs with a new disc protrusion in the adjacent level. A 41-year-old man was admitted with radiating pain and numbness in the left lower extremity with a left posterolateral disc extrusion at L5-S1 level. He was admitted to hospital with low back pain due to disc herniation caudally immigrating at L4-5 level three years ago. He refused the surgical intervention that was offered and was treated conservatively at that time. He had no neurological deficit and a history of spontaneous regression of the extruded lumbar disc; so, a conservative therapy, including bed rest, physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and analgesics, was advised. In conclusion, herniated lumbar disc fragments may regress spontaneously. Reports are prone to advise conservative treatment for extruded or sequestrated lumbar disc herniations. However, these patients should be followed up closely; new herniation at adjacent/different level may occur. Furthermore, it is important to know which herniated disk should be removed and which should be treated conservatively, because disc herniation may cause serious complications as muscle weakness and cauda equine syndrome.\nDocument [2]: Title: Lumbar disc herniations: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment. Abstract: Lumbar disc herniation is among the most common causes of lower-back pain and sciatica. The cause(s) of lumbar disc herniation and the relation of lumbar disc herniation to back pain and sciatica have not been fully elucidated, but most likely comprise a complex combination of mechanical and biologic processes. Furthermore, the natural history of lumbar disc herniation seems generally to be favorable, leaving the optimum treatment for lumbar disc herniation a debate in the literature. Various nonoperative and operative treatment strategies have been tried with varying degrees of success. Treatment often involves patient education, physical therapy, alternative medicine options, and pharmaco-therapy. If these fail, surgical intervention is usually recommended. A literature search was conducted to evaluate the currently known effectiveness of traditional and novel non-operative and surgical techniques for the treatment lumbar disc herniation and to determine if there are substantive new advantages in these newer contemporary treatments or combinations thereof. A structured approach to treatment of a patient who may have a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is presented, based on analysis of the current literature. No one method of nonoperative or operative treatment would seem definitively to be superior to another. Appropriate multidisciplinary treatment including behavioral analysis and support may offer the hope of improved outcomes for patients with lumbar disc herniation.\nDocument [3]: Title: Lumbar extension exercises in conjunction with mechanical traction for the management of a patient with a lumbar herniated disc. Abstract: Low back pain resulting from lumbar disc herniation is a common reason for referral for physical therapy. There is no evidence to support the management of lumbar disc herniation and derangement using mechanical traction combined with lumbar extension exercises. Therefore, the purpose of this case report was to describe and discuss the use of mechanical traction in conjunction with lumbar extension exercises for a patient with a lumbar herniated disc. The patient was a 49-year-old male referred to physical therapy with a medical diagnosis of a lumbar herniated disc at L5-S1 with compression of the L5 nerve root confirmed by MRI. The patient's chief complaint was pain over the left lumbosacral and central lumbar region with radiating pain into the left buttock accompanied by numbness and tingling in the left lower leg and foot. The patient was seen for a total of 14 visits. The first 5 days (2 weeks) of therapy consisted of lumbar extension exercises. For the following nine visits (over a 3-week period), mechanical traction was added as an adjunct to the extension exercises. Outcome measures included the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, Back Pain Function Scale (BPFS), and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Results from initial evaluation to discharge (Oswestry: 36% to 0%; BPFS: 33/60 to 57/60; NPRS: 7/10 to 0/10) demonstrated that the patient no longer experienced low back pain and improved in terms of functional status and pain-related disability. The patient no longer complained of numbness and tingling in the left lower extremity and the goals for the patient had been attained. The data from this case report suggests lumbar extension exercises in conjunction with mechanical traction facilitated the patient's improvement in pain and return to prior level of function.\nDocument [4]: Title: Unusual case of camptocormia triggered by lumbar-disc herniation. Abstract: A 21-year-old male patient with low back pain and marked forward bending was presented. The exaggerated lumbar flexion was preventing him to stand in erect posture but disappeared while lying. The symptoms had begun after he had lifted a heavy object. Straight-leg-raising test could not be performed properly because of the exaggerated pain. The light-touch sense was decreased on L5 and S1 dermatomes. There was no loss of muscle strength. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Plain graph showed mild narrowing in the L4-5 and L5-S1 intervertebral spaces. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed disc protrusions in L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. During his stay in the department, the patient was given tizanidine and tramadol, and physical therapy was performed. A paravertebral intramuscular injection with lidocaine was applied. Moreover, the patient was referred to psychiatrist for evaluation regarding his medical history of conversive seizures and possible efforts for secondary gain. No response was obtained from all the treatments. The final diagnosis was camptocormia triggered by lumbar-disc herniation. He was applied supportive psychotherapy, psychoeducation regarding secondary gain, strong suggestions to improve posture, positive reinforcement, and behavioral therapy. His postural abnormality resolved and disappeared completely with mild pain.\nDocument [5]: Title: Large abdominal aortic aneurysm presented with concomitant acute lumbar disc herniation - a case report. Abstract: The purpose of this case report was to describe chiropractic management of acute lumbar disc herniation in a patient with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm. A 72-year-old male patient presented with low back pain and right lower leg numbness for 12 months. A review of full-spine X-ray and lumbar MRI revealed moderate spondylosis at L2-5, moderate lumbar scoliosis, and a 7.15 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Given the minimum 2-weeks of referral waiting time to receive treatment for AAA, the patient received chiropractic treatment with a hybrid rehabilitation to address the disc herniation causing severe physical disability. Through the treatments, the patient's pain was significantly alleviated with careful consideration of potential risk factors associated with AAA. In addition, the acute disc herniation was successfully managed by a series of chiropractic treatments before and after the operation for AAA. This case supports that low back pain in patients with AAA can be managed by manual therapy, in contrast to a widespread belief that manual therapy is contraindicated in AAA. More case reports of AAA patients with low back pain are warranted to assess the effectiveness and safety of manual therapy along with surgical treatment for AAA.\nDocument [6]: Title: Effect of continuous lumbar traction on the size of herniated disc material in lumbar disc herniation. Abstract: We investigated the effects of continuous lumbar traction in patients with lumbar disc herniation on clinical findings, and size of the herniated disc measured by computed tomography (CT). In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, 46 patients with lumbar disc herniation were included, and randomized into two groups as the traction group (24 patients), and the control group (22 patients). The traction group was given a physical therapy program and continuous lumbar traction. The control group was given the same physical therapy program without traction, for the same duration of time. Data for the clinical symptoms and signs were collected before and after the treatment together with calculation of a herniation index, from the CT images that showed the size of the herniated disc material. In the traction group, most of the clinical findings significantly improved with treatment. Size of the herniated disc material in CT decreased significantly only in the traction group. In the traction group the herniation index decreased from 276.6+/-129.6 to 212.5+/-84.3 with treatment (p<0.01). In the control group, pretreatment value was 293.4+/-112.1, and it decreased to 285.4+/-115.4 after the treatment (p>0.05). Patients with greater herniations tended to respond better to traction. In conclusion, lumbar traction is both effective in improving symptoms and clinical findings in patients with lumbar disc herniation and also in decreasing the size of the herniated disc material as measured by CT.\nDocument [7]: Title: Lumbar disc herniation in tae kwon do athletic child. Abstract: Lumbar disc herniation is extremely uncommon in children below 10 years of age. A 7-year-old boy is reported who presented with low back pain and left leg radiating pain. The pain started seven days prior to presentation and was attributed to performing the jumping kick without any previous warm-up. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a posterolateral disc herniation at the L3-4 level and multiple degenerative changes. The patient received conservative treatment including limitation of sports activities, anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant medications as well as physical therapy. After three months of the aggressive treatment the child was symptom free. We present here a lumbar disc herniation in one of the youngest patient.\nDocument [8]: Title: Lumbar instrumented fusion compared with cognitive intervention and exercises in patients with chronic back pain after previous surgery for disc herniation: a prospective randomized controlled study. Abstract: The effectiveness of lumbar fusion for chronic low back pain after surgery for disc herniation has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of lumbar fusion with posterior transpedicular screws and cognitive intervention and exercises. Sixty patients aged 25-60 years with low back pain lasting longer than 1 year after previous surgery for disc herniation were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups. Experienced back surgeons performed transpedicular fusion. Cognitive intervention consisted of a lecture intended to give the patient an understanding that ordinary physical activity would not harm the disc and a recommendation to use the back and bend it. This was reinforced by three daily physical exercise sessions for 3 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Outcome data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Ninety-seven percent of the patients, including seven of eight patients who had either not attended treatment (n=5) or changed groups (n=2), completed 1-year follow-up. ODI was significantly improved from 47 to 38 after fusion and from 45 to 32 after cognitive intervention and exercises. The mean difference between treatments after adjustment for gender was -7.3 (95% CI -17.3 to 2.7, p=0.15). The success rate was 50% in the fusion group and 48% in the cognitive intervention/exercise group. For patients with chronic low back pain after previous surgery for disc herniation, lumbar fusion failed to show any benefit over cognitive intervention and exercises.\nDocument [9]: Title: Efficacy and durability of radiopaque gelified ethanol in management of herniated discs. Abstract: Background Percutaneous image-guided intradiscal injection of gelified ethanol was introduced to treat herniated disc disease lately. The aim of the study was to assess clinical efficacy and durability over a 36 months' period. Patients and methods Eighty-three patients (47 males, 36 females, mean age 48.9 years (18-79 years) were treated between May 2014 and December 2015 for 16 cervical and 67 lumbar chronical contained disc herniations. For pain assessment evaluation, the visual analog scale (VAS) was used. Physical activity, the use of analgesics, patients' satisfaction with the treatment results and patient's willingness to repeat the treatment were also evaluated. Results Fifty-nine patients responded to questionnaire. 89.8% had significant reduction in VAS after 1 month (p < 0.001); 76.9% of patients with cervical symptoms and 93.5% of patients with lumbar symptoms. In cervical group it remained stable, while in lumbar group VAS decreased even more during 36 months (p = 0.012). Single patient had spinal surgery. Moderate and severe physical disability prior to treatment (96.6%) was reduced to less than 30% after 12 months. The majority of active patients returned to their regular job (71.1%); 78% needed less analgesics. Only 5.1% patients were not satisfied with the treatment and 10.2% would not repeat the treatment if needed. Conclusions Percutaneous image-guided intradiscal injection of gelified ethanol is safe, effective and durable therapy for chronic contained cervical and lumbar herniations. Due to minimal invasiveness and long-lasting benefits, this kind of treatment should be proposed to designated group of patients as first-line therapy.\nDocument [10]: Title: Exacerbation of symptoms of lumbar disc herniation complicated by a schwannoma: a case report. Abstract: Herniation of the lumbar disc is a common cause of low back pain. Conservative management with physiotherapy, such as lumbar spine traction, is usually effective. Although a schwannoma of the lumbar spine is relatively uncommon, the clinical manifestations are similar to those of lumbar disc herniation, making the diagnosis difficult. This case report describes a 51-year-old male who had suffered from low back pain for 3 years and who was diagnosed with L2/L3 lumbar disc herniation. The low back pain was well-controlled by conservative treatment and the symptoms improved progressively. Two months prior to our evaluation, however, the symptoms worsened acutely, and were accompanied by the onset of symptoms of cauda equina syndrome. A small tumor at the site of the L2/L3 disc herniation, observed incidentally during magnetic resonance imaging, was responsible for the symptoms of spinal stenosis at the lumbar region. The patient underwent laminectomy, tumor resection, and discectomy with near-complete resolution of symptoms. In patients with lumbar disc herniation that improves with conservative treatment, the recurrence of symptoms should prompt a thorough review of the medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies to establish the diagnosis and prevent delay in treatment.\nDocument [11]: Title: Evaluation of the effectiveness of transforaminal epidural steroid injection in far lateral lumbar disc herniations. Abstract: Far lateral lumbar disc herniations (FLDH) consist approximately 0.7-12% of all lumbar disc herniations. Compared to the more common central and paramedian lumbar disc herniations, they cause more severe and persistent radicular pain due to direct compression of the nerve root and dorsal root ganglion. In patients who do not respond to conservative treatments such as medical treatment and physical therapy, and have not developed neurological deficits, it is difficult to decide on surgical treatment because of the nerve root damage and spinal instability risk due to disruption of facet joint integrity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) on the improvement of both pain control and functional capacity in patients with FLDH.\nDocument [12]: Title: A Case of Postoperative Recurrent Lumbar Disc Herniation Conservatively Treated with Novel Intradiscal Condoliase Injection. Abstract: Although postoperative recurrent lumbar disc herniation (rec-LDH) is uncommon, it is a challenging situation that requires revision surgery when conservative treatment fails. Recently, an agent inducing chemical dissolution of the nucleus pulposus using condoliase has been approved as a novel intradiscal treatment for LDH. To date, no evidence has been reported regarding its effectiveness in the treatment of postoperative rec-LDH. A 25-year-old man with a history of LDH in L4/5, who underwent transforaminal full endoscopic lumbar discectomy when he was 17 years old, complained of severe pain radiating to his left leg since 1 month. The straight leg-raising test was limited to 25\u00b0 on the left side. Lumbar T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed intracanal, left-sided transligamentous disc herniation at L4/5 with high-signal intensity. Because the conservative treatment with oral analgesics and selective left L5 nerve root block failed, the patient requested intradiscal condoliase injection instead of revision surgery. There were no adverse events reported after the condoliase treatment, and the pain radiating to the left leg improved within 2 weeks. A lumbar MRI performed 2 months after treatment revealed that the disc herniation had significantly decreased in size. The straight leg-raising test examined 3 months after treatment was negative. In this case, the disc herniation was of the transligamentous type and showed a high-signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI which could be suitably treated by condoliase injection therapy. This case report is the first to suggest that intradiscal condoliase injection could be a useful and novel conservative treatment option to treat postoperative rec-LDH.\nDocument [13]: Title: Regression of a large prolapsed lumbar disc herniation achieved by conservative treatment: A case report and literature review. Abstract: A common spinal condition known as lumbar disc herniation (LDH) can result in radicular and low back discomfort. A 27-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a 6-year history of persistent low back pain, and his low back pain had recurred with radiation to his lower extremities over the last two months. An extensive right-sided paracentral disc herniation in the L5/S1 intervertebral region, which compressed the nerve root, was discovered by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his lumbar spine. After receiving conservative treatment, the patient reported that his lower back discomfort and neurogenic claudication had gradually subsided after 4 months. After one year, a follow-up MRI showed that the massive, prolapsed disc herniation at the L5/S1 level had totally disappeared. The sagittal protrusion length of the L5/S1 intervertebral disc shrank from 12.35 mm to 3.49 mm. However, there remained a chance of vertebral height loss. During the course of treatment, the height of the L5/S1 intervertebral space was still slightly reduced. The intervertebral space height declined from 7.705 mm to 7.201 mm after one year of treatment. The current case and a review of the literature demonstrate that LDH can decrease with conservative therapy over a short period of time. We stress the effectiveness of conservative treatment in very select LDH cases that lack a clear surgical justification.\nDocument [14]: Title: Does preoperative opioid therapy in patients with a single lumbar disc herniation positively influence the postoperative outcome detected by quantitative sensory testing? Abstract: The importance of the type of pain medication in spinal disease is an ongoing matter of debate. Recent guidelines recommend acetaminophen and NSAIDs as first-line medication for lumbar disc herniation. However, opioid pain medication is commonly used in patients with chronic pain, and therefore also in patients with sciatica. The aim of this study is to evaluate if opioids have an impact on the outcome in patients suffering from lumbar disc herniation. To assess this objectively quantitative sensory testing (QST) was applied. In total, 52 patients with a single lumbar disc herniation confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and treated by lumbar sequesterectomy were included in the trial. Patients were analysed according to their preoperative opioid intake: 35 patients who did not receive opioids (group NO) and 17 patients, who received opioids preoperatively (group O). Further evaluation included detailed medical history, physical examination, various questionnaires, and QST. No pre- and postoperative differences were detected in thermal or mechanical thresholds (p > 0.05). Wind-up ratio (WUR) differed significantly between groups 1 week postoperatively (p = 0.025). The NRS for low back pain was rated significantly higher in the non-opioid group (NO) after 1-week follow-up (p = 0.026). Radicular pain tended to be higher in the NO group after 12 months of follow-up (p = 0.023). Opioids seem to be a positive predictor for the postoperative pain outcome in early follow-up in patients undergoing lumbar sequesterectomy. Furthermore, patients presented with less radicular pain 1 year after surgery.\nDocument [15]: Title: Non-surgical Restoration of L3/L4 Disc Herniation. Abstract: We report the case of a 52-year-old Asian man presenting with severe lower back pain and bilateral radiculopathy due to acute L3/L4 disc extrusion, causing severe spinal canal stenosis and bilateral L4 nerve root compression. Following a ten-week conservative management plan consisting of high-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation, adjunctive therapies, and home exercise, the patient experienced significant pain relief, functional improvement, and near resolution of deficits. A six-month follow-up MRI revealed the resolution of the L3/L4 disc extrusion, and the patient remained asymptomatic at nine months. This case highlights the potential for spontaneous resorption of a lumbar disc herniation and symptomatic improvement with conservative management, including chiropractic treatment. A favorable natural course of a disc herniation should be considered when deciding between early surgical intervention and conservative management, warranting further prospective studies to evaluate the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment and the role of spontaneous regression in symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.\nDocument [16]: Title: Logistic Model and Gradient Boosting Machine Model for Physical Therapy of Lumbar Disc Herniation. Abstract: Physical therapy is a common clinical treatment for patients with lumbar disc herniation. The study is aimed at exploring the feasibility of mathematical expression and curative effect prediction of physical therapy in patients with lumbar disc herniation using a logistic model and gradient boosting machine (GBM).\nDocument [17]: Title: Perineal anesthesia following interlaminar endoscopic disc surgery. Abstract: Perineal anesthesia is defined as the loss of sensation to the area of buttocks, perianal space and thighs. It is often seen in cauda equina syndrome as a collection of acute symptoms mostly occurring secondary to a large disc herniations leading to neuropathy of multiple lumbar and sacral nerve roots. We present 30 years- old male patient who was admitted with sever left leg pain for over a month. On neurological examination a 3/5 plantarflexion paresis was observed on the left with hypoesthesia concordant to the S1 dermatome. A lumbar MRI showed a broad left L5-S1 disc herniation was detected. The patient underwent interlaminar endoscopic disc surgery and postoperatively, was relieved of his pain and a slightly improvement of his paresis was seen. On the first week follow-up he complained of anesthesia of his buttocks when sitting. On follow-up MRI, the disc was removed completely and no further pathologies could be seen. The patient continued physical therapy and on the 8th week postoperatively his paresis and perineal anesthesia resolved completely. Perineal anesthesia following endoscopic disc surgery was a complication we never have experienced at out clinic. Even when searching through medical databases we have not seen any reports in the literature in that way.\nDocument [18]: Title: Influences of spinal decompression therapy and general traction therapy on the pain, disability, and straight leg raising of patients with intervertebral disc herniation. Abstract: [Purpose] The purpose of this study was to identify how spinal decompression therapy and general traction therapy influence the pain, disability, and straight leg raise (SLR) ability of patients with intervertebral disc herniation. [Subjects] The subjects were 30 patients with chronic lumbar pain who were divided into a spinal decompression therapy group (SDTG, n=15), and a general traction therapy group (GTTG, n=15). [Methods] The SDTG used a spinal decompression device, and the GTTG used a lumbar traction device. Both groups received conservative physical therapy three times a week for four weeks. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure the degree of pain the patients with chronic lumbar pain. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to measure the degree of functional disability. A goniometer was used to measure the patients' SLR ability. [Results] Both SDTG and GTTG showed statistically significant decreases in VAS and ODI scores and a statistically significant increase in SLR angle. A comparison of the two groups found no statistically significant differences. [Conclusion] Spinal decompression therapy and general traction therapy are effective at improving the pain, disability, and SLR of patients with intervertebral disc herniation. Thus, selective treatment may be required.\nDocument [19]: Title: Regression of lumbar disc herniation with non-surgical treatment: a case report. Abstract: To date, only a few reports have described the regression of lumbar disc herniation, which may be because of a failure to follow up patients treated conservatively. We report a case of a 25-year-old man who presented with a 2-month history of pain and soreness owing to lumbar disc herniation. He was managed conservatively, and his presenting symptoms and scoliosis gradually decreased over approximately 5 months. Two years later, he returned unexpectedly and was advised to undergo magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed regression of the disc herniation; the patient also confirmed that the pain had not recurred. After 8 months, he underwent repeat magnetic resonance imaging, and the findings pertaining to disc herniation were normal. Our findings suggest that previous cases should be retrospectively studied to establish a prediction model for the outcomes of conservative treatment in patients with lumbar disc herniation. We also emphasize the significance of selecting suitable patients for conservative treatment to obtain the best therapeutic outcomes. The CARE guidelines have been followed in the reporting of this case.\nDocument [20]: Title: Spontaneous regression of a large sequestered lumbar disc herniation: a case report and literature review. Abstract: Lumbar disc herniation is a common disorder in adults that is accompanied by lower back and radicular pain. A 32-year-old man visited our clinic with 1-week history of persistent lower back pain and weakness in his right big toe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his lumbar spine revealed herniated discs at L3/L4, L5/S1 and L4/L5, where a right-sided intraspinal mass lesion deep to the L4 vertebral body was causing compression of the nerve root. The patient underwent conservative treatment and reported no symptoms referrable to his back or leg 4 months later. Follow-up MRI showed no herniation of the nucleus pulposus at the L4/L5 level or lesion deep to the vertebral body of L4, whereas no changes had occurred to the status of the herniated L3/L4 and L5/S1 discs. The present case and a literature review show that a sequestered lumbar disc herniation can regress within a relatively short timeframe without surgery. The authors emphasise the utility of conservative therapy for patients who do not have a definitive surgical indication.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Along with coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD) is primarily caused by atherosclerosis. In fact, PAD is a marker of advanced atherosclerotic disease, as evidenced from several studies that suggest approximately 60% of patients with PAD have polyvascular disease or manifestations of atherosclerosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular territories as well. However, despite a PAD prevalence that is > 15% in patients with cardiovascular risk factors aged 60 to 69 years and > 35% in patients aged 70 to 82 years, there is a lack of disease awareness on the part of both physicians and patients. This lack of awareness most likely contributes to the high cardiovascular risk associated with a diagnosis of PAD. For example, in the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry, patients with PAD experienced the highest rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for atherothrombotic events. High-risk patients should be screened for the presence of PAD. If diagnosed, physicians should institute a comprehensive treatment strategy that includes lifestyle modification and appropriate risk-reducing therapies. Because PAD is a manifestation of atherosclerosis, antiplatelet therapy should be a critical component of any PAD treatment plan. This article reviews the epidemiology and cardiovascular risks associated with PAD, as well as available diagnostic and treatment options.\nDocument [2]: Title: A 70-year-old man with a transient ischemic attack: review of internal carotid artery stenosis. Abstract: Mr V, a man with severe coronary, aortic, and peripheral artery disease, had an episode of brain ischemia caused by severe preocclusive carotid artery disease in the neck. The major treatment options for his symptomatic carotid artery disease are optimizing medical treatment, carotid endarterectomy, and carotid artery stenting. Selection of treatment must take into consideration his severe symptomatic coronary artery disease as well as Mr V's concerns about surgery. Carotid endarterectomy presents a risk of myocardial infarction unless his coronary disease is treated effectively before surgery. Carotid stenting is problematic because the severity of the preocclusive arterial narrowing makes passing a protective device beyond the stenosis difficult without first performing potentially hazardous angioplasty. Optimizing medical treatment may be the best option for his severe systemic atherosclerosis. Treatment decisions in complex patients like Mr V require weighing the particular risks and benefits of available options, and the patient's own wishes and fears. These decisions, in this and other complex patients, often cannot be directly informed by results from randomized trials.\nDocument [3]: Title: Treatment of atherosclerosis by traditional Chinese medicine: Questions and quandaries. Abstract: Atherosclerosis and its complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, are the major causes of morbidity and mortality, and development of effective therapies for both prevention and treatment of this disease is critically important. Currently, there are many drugs available for atherosclerotic disease, but the lipid-lowering drugs statins are still the first-choice for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicines, mainly Chinese herbal medicines (CHM), have been widely used in China and in other Asian countries for the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases. Although many CHMs have been reported to be effective for treating atherosclerotic diseases for more than two thousand years, there are still many difficulties for their use, such as lack of scientific evidence assessed by rigorous clinical trials, complicated components and unclear pharmacological mechanisms, which often hamper the widespread use of CHMs in Western countries. Due to these concerns, CHMs are usually considered as complimentary or alternative treatment for atherosclerotic diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis viewed by Western and traditional Chinese medicine, summarize pros and cons on the efficacy of CHMs for atherosclerosis and discuss what is necessary for CHM use to spread to Western societies.\nDocument [4]: Title: Atherosclerosis: Known and unknown. Abstract: Atherosclerotic disease, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, is the number one killer worldwide. Atherosclerosis is considered to be caused by multiple factors, including genetic and environmental factors. In humans, it takes several decades until the clinical complications develop. There are many known risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking, which are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis; however, it is generally believed that atherosclerosis is vascular chronic inflammation initiated by interactions of these risk factors and arterial wall cells. In the past 30 years, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have been investigated extensively using genetically modified animals, and lipid-reducing drugs, such as statins, have been demonstrated as the most effective for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. However, despite this progress, questions regarding the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remain and there is a need to develop new animal models and novel therapeutics to treat patients who cannot be effectively treated by statins. In this review, we will focus on two topics of atherosclerosis, \"pathology\" and \"pathogenesis,\" and discuss unanswered questions.\nDocument [5]: Title: Cyanotic congenital heart disease and atherosclerosis. Abstract: Improved treatment options in paediatric cardiology and congenital heart surgery have resulted in an ageing population of patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD). The risk of acquired heart disease such as atherosclerosis increases with age.Previous studies have speculated whether patients with CCHD are protected against atherosclerosis. Results have shown that the coronary arteries of patients with CCHD are free from plaques and stenosis. Decreased carotid intima-media thickness and low total plasma cholesterol may indicate a reduced risk of later development of atherosclerosis. However, the evidence is still sparse and questionable, and a reasonable explanation for the decreased risk of developing atherosclerosis in patients with CCHD is still missing.This review provides an overview of what is known about the prevalence and potential causes of the reduced risk of atherosclerosis in patients with CCHD.\nDocument [6]: Title: Resolving hyperlipidemia after liver transplantation in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Abstract: A 64-year-old man with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and resultant liver failure presented to our hospital with severe dyslipidemia (total cholesterol, 525 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 489 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 13 mg/dL; triglycerides, 114 mg/d) and coronary artery disease. The abnormal lipid profile of patients with cholestatic liver disease, such as PSC, includes an abnormal atherogenic LDL called lipoproteinX. The patient's dyslipidemia persisted despite treatment with a statin. Lipids normalized only after liver transplantation (total cholesterol, 135 mg/dL; LDL cholesterol, 60 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 48 mg/dL; triglycerides, 130 mg/dL). To the best of our knowledge, the dramatic improvement in the lipid profile after liver transplantation represents the first such published report for PSC. The recognition of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis in those with cholestatic liver disease and the normalization of lipid profile after liver transplantation warrant further study. We present a review of dyslipidemia in cholestatic liver disease, its relationship to atherosclerosis, and its treatment.\nDocument [7]: Title: The Role of Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Atherosclerosis and Impact of Anti-Lipemic Treatments on Endothelial Repair. Abstract: Cardiovascular complications are associated with advanced atherosclerosis. Although atherosclerosis is still regarded as an incurable disease, at least in its more advanced stages, the discovery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), with their ability to replace old and injured cells and differentiate into healthy and functional mature endothelial cells, has shifted our view of atherosclerosis as an incurable disease, and merged traditional theories of atherosclerosis pathogenesis with evolving concepts of vascular biology. EPC alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of vascular abnormalities in atherosclerosis, but many questions remain unanswered. Many currently available drugs that impact cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have shown a positive effect on EPC biology. This review examines the role of endothelial progenitor cells in atherosclerosis development, and the impact standard antilipemic drugs, including statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe, as well as more novel treatments such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) modulating agents and angiopoietin-like proteins (Angtpl3) inhibitors have on EPC biology.\nDocument [8]: Title: Atherosclerosis Induced by Chlamydophila pneumoniae: A Controversial Theory. Abstract: More than a century ago, inflammation and infection were considered to have atherogenic effects. The old idea that coronary heart disease (CHD) possibly has an infectious etiology has only reemerged in recent years. Atherosclerosis is the main pathological process involved in CHD and is, logically, the first place to look for infectious etiology. The process of atherosclerosis itself provides the first hints of potential infectious cause. Smooth muscle proliferation, with subsequent intimal thickening, luminal narrowing, and endothelial degeneration, constitutes the natural history of atherosclerosis, being with the severity and speed of these changes. Both viral and bacterial pathogens have been proposed to be associated with the inflammatory changes found in atherosclerosis. Recently, Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) has been implicated as a possible etiologic agent of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. New evidence which supports a role for C. pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has emerged. C. pneumoniae has been detected in atherosclerotic arteries by several techniques, and the organism has been isolated from both coronary and carotid atheromas. Recent animal models have suggested that C. pneumoniae is capable of inducing atherosclerosis in both rabbit and mouse models of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, human clinical treatment studies which examined the use of antichlamydial macrolide antibiotics in patients with coronary atherosclerosis have been carried out. The causal relationship has not yet been proven, but ongoing large intervention trials and research on pathogenetic mechanisms may lead to the use of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of CHD in the future.\nDocument [9]: Title: An Update on Obstructive Sleep Apnea for Atherosclerosis: Mechanism, Diagnosis, and Treatment. Abstract: The occurrence and development of atherosclerosis could be influenced by intermittent hypoxia. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by intermittent hypoxia, is world-wide prevalence with increasing morbidity and mortality rates. Researches remain focused on the study of its mechanism and improvement of diagnosis and treatment. However, the underlying mechanism is complex, and the best practice for OSA diagnosis and treatment considering atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases is still debatable. In this review, we provided an update on research in OSA in the last 5 years with regard to atherosclerosis. The processes of inflammation, oxidative stress, autonomic nervous system activation, vascular dysfunction, platelet activation, metabolite dysfunction, small molecule RNA regulation, and the cardioprotective occurrence was discussed. Additionally, improved diagnosis such as, the utilized of portable device, and treatment especially with inconsistent results in continuous positive airway pressure and mandibular advancement devices were illustrated in detail. Therefore, further fundamental and clinical research should be carried out for a better understanding the deep interaction between OSA and atherosclerosis, as well as the suggestion of newer diagnostic and treatment options.\nDocument [10]: Title: A patient with Werner syndrome and adiponectin gene mutation. Abstract: Werner syndrome is a premature aging disease characterized by genomic instability and increased cancer risk. Here, we report a 45-year-old diabetic man as the first Werner syndrome patient found to have an adiponectin gene mutation. Showing graying and loss of hair, skin atrophy, and juvenile cataract, he was diagnosed with Werner syndrome type 4 by molecular analysis. His serum adiponectin concentration was low. In the globular domain of the adiponectin gene, I164T in exon 3 was detected. When we examined effects of pioglitazone (15 mg/day) on serum adiponectin multimer and monomer concentrations using selective assays, the patient's relative percentage increased in adiponectin concentration was almost same as that in the 18 diabetic patients without an adiponectin mutation, but the absolute adiponectin concentration was half of those seen in diabetic patients treated with the same pioglitazone dose who had no adiponectin mutation. The response suggested that pioglitazone treatment might help to prevent future Werner syndrome-related acceleration of atherosclerosis. Present and further clinical relevant to atherosclerosis in this patient should be imformative concerning the pathogenesis and treatment of atherosclerosis in the presence of hypoadiponectinemia and insulin resistance.\nDocument [11]: Title: Coronary Artery Ectasia: A Case Report Discussing the Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment. Abstract: The localized or diffused dilation of a coronary artery lumen is referred to as coronary artery ectasia (CAE). Though it is well recognized, CAE is a rare finding that is encountered in the diagnostic procedure of coronary angiography. This form of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) can be found in 1.4-4.9% of all coronary angiography patients. CAE can manifest in combination with stenotic lesions or present as an isolated condition. Its risk factors are similar to those of atherosclerosis. The underlying pathophysiology involves a vascular remodeling response to atherosclerosis. Enzymatic degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and accumulation of lipoproteins play an important role in the remodeling process. CAE can be diagnosed with the help of imaging modalities such as coronary CT angiogram (CTA) and coronary magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA); coronary angiography is considered the gold standard procedure. The management strategies include treating the cardiovascular risk factors, prevention of thromboembolic events, and percutaneous/vascular revascularization. CAE can be managed medically, but percutaneous/surgical revascularization [coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)] is an option to treat patients with co-existing symptomatic obstructive lesion refractory to medical treatment. Further trials are required to optimize the management guidelines related to CAE. In this report, we describe the case of a 42-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and asthma who presented with shortness of breath and minimally elevated troponin level. Coronary angiography revealed three vessels with ectasia and severe left ventricular dysfunction on ventriculography.\nDocument [12]: Title: Multimodality imaging approach in a case of vascular toxicity caused by cabozantinib. Abstract: Vascular toxicity caused by cancer treatment can present as vasospasm, arterial thrombosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis. We report a case of a 60-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma under cabozantinib treatment for 3 years who presented to the hospital with relapsing episodes of rest angina. Due to the presence of ST depression in the 12-lead electrocardiogram and elevated troponin, a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was suspected. The patient underwent invasive coronary angiography, which revealed extended coronary artery spasm, and it subsided totally after nitrate administration. One year later, the patient presented again at the cardio-oncology outpatient clinic, reporting relapsing episodes of angina during the previous month. Coronary computed tomography angiography was performed, and it revealed 2 subsequent 70%-99% stenosis in OM1. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient treated with cabozantinib presenting with coronary artery spasm and accelerated atherosclerosis, in which a multimodality imaging approach was followed.\nDocument [13]: Title: How and when do we alter inflammatory mechanisms in stroke? Will it help? Abstract: The emerging recognition of atherosclerosis as primarily a chronic inflammatory process opens new possibilities to the treatment options that can reduce the risk of atherothrombotic stroke. The question is, \"How do we alter the inflammatory mechanisms in atherosclerosis and will it reduce the risk of stroke?\" Investigation into the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the initiation, formation, and activation of atherosclerotic plaques is critical if we are to successfully employ pharmacotherapeutic strategies to reduce stroke risk. This article will review the key inflammatory elements associated with atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic stroke, identify potential inflammatory markers associated with the increased risk of stroke, review the effects of currently available medications that may have a beneficial impact on atherosclerosis and stroke, and briefly explore potential future strategies for reducing inflammation.\nDocument [14]: Title: NaF-PET Imaging of Atherosclerosis Burden. Abstract: The method of 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) of atherosclerosis was introduced 12 years ago. This approach is particularly interesting because it demonstrates microcalcification as an incipient sign of atherosclerosis before the development of arterial wall macrocalcification detectable by CT. However, this method has not yet found its place in the clinical routine. The more exact association between NaF uptake and future arterial calcification is not fully understood, and it remains unclear to what extent NaF-PET may replace or significantly improve clinical cardiovascular risk scoring. The first 10 years of publications in the field were characterized by heterogeneity at multiple levels, and it is not clear how the method may contribute to triage and management of patients with atherosclerosis, including monitoring effects of anti-atherosclerosis intervention. The present review summarizes findings from the recent 2\u00be years including the ability of NaF-PET imaging to assess disease progress and evaluate response to treatment. Despite valuable new information, pertinent questions remain unanswered, not least due to a pronounced lack of standardization within the field and of well-designed long-term studies illuminating the natural history of atherosclerosis and effects of intervention.\nDocument [15]: Title: [Surgical treatment of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs]. Abstract: Walking exercise, smoking cessation and best medical therapy are cornerstones in all treatment of atherosclerosis. For patients with intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia, endovascular therapy (which has developed substantially during the last decade) has become the first line treatment (when feasible). The aim of this article is to provide an overview of options for surgical treatment of peripheral atherosclerosis in the lower limbs.\nDocument [16]: Title: Selecting the best noninvasive imaging test to guide treatment after an inconclusive exercise test. Abstract: The first step towards approaching a patient with an inconclusive stress test is to identify the initial reason why a stress test was ordered and examine what factors led to inconclusive test results. Next, it is important to ask whether the patient will benefit from further testing, as not all patients with inconclusive test results require additional testing. In patients who are at low-to-intermediate risk, it may be useful to perform coronary CT angiography (CTA) to exclude the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Among individuals with no prior history of coronary artery disease, a possible advantage of CTA is that if subclinical atherosclerosis is identified, intensification of lifestyle interventions, and often pharmacotherapy, should be advocated. On the other hand, in high-risk patients or individuals that already have coronary artery disease, the primary objective is to quantify the presence and magnitude of ischemia in order to define the potential role of coronary revascularization procedures. This can be achieved by myocardial perfusion imaging using nuclear imaging or cardiac MRI. Alternatively, a functional evaluation to identify stress-induced wall motion abnormalities using stress echocardiography or MRI can be obtained. In selecting which test to obtain, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of different imaging tests and to consider patient factors (e.g., body habitus) that may influence the accuracy of various tests. In addition, physicians should consider whether there are any other clinical questions that require imaging. For instance, cardiac MRI may be used to evaluate for infiltrative myocardial disease or pericardial disease whereas cardiac CT can evaluate for lung pathology or diseases of the aorta. Finally, any decision regarding what type of additional testing to obtain should also be based on knowing the local expertise and availability of various testing options.\nDocument [17]: Title: Fatal ischemic enteritis with hemorrhage--a late complication of treated Wilms tumor. Abstract: A 35-year-old man with a history of childhood Wilms tumor successfully treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, collapsed and died unexpectedly in hospital following admission for abdominal pain. At autopsy, there was ischemic necrosis of the small intestine with altered blood within the stomach and small intestine. Within the upper abdominal aorta, there was patchy confluent calcific atherosclerosis with extension into the proximal superior mesenteric artery which was occluded by thrombus. Death was attributed to ischemic enteritis of the small intestine caused by mesenteric artery thrombosis complicated by gastrointestinal hemorrhage with aspiration. Localization of atherosclerosis to the radiation field with no significant atherosclerosis elsewhere and the young age of the decedent were supportive of radiation-induced atherogenesis. Geographically, localized atherosclerosis at autopsy in a tumor survivor should raise the possibility of a treatment-related side effect that may directly contribute to death many years after the original therapeutic intervention.\nDocument [18]: Title: [Atherosclerosis of the intracranial arteries and of the extracranial carotid artery.] Abstract: Atherosclerosis of the intracranial arteries and of the extracranial carotid artery. <b>Abstract.</b> Intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses are the most common cause of ischemic stroke worldwide. Nowadays, three therapeutic approaches are available for consideration for patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses: A conservative therapy (best medical treatment, management of vascular risk factors and healthy lifestyle), endovascular and surgical therapy. Conservative approach has been recommended for patients with asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses, as well as for those with symptomatic stenoses. Endovascular therapy should be considered as a treatment option for carefully selected patients with recurrent ischemic strokes attributed to the stenotic artery while receiving best medical therapy. Surgical revascularisation is rarely favored in patients with intracranial stenoses. In patients with extracranial atherosclerotic stenoses, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been associated with a lower risk of death and recurrent stroke when compared to carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). Especially in elderly patients over 70 years of age CEA is preferred over CAS due to the twofold increased 30-day risk of recurrent stroke or death in patients treated with CAS. Results from contemporary studies using modern techniques and devices are expected. It remains unclear whether patients with asymptomatic extracranial atherosclerotic stenoses receiving best medical treatment would benefit of invasive procedures such as CEA or CAS.\nDocument [19]: Title: Investigation of Specific Proteins Related to Different Types of Coronary Atherosclerosis. Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a complex disease caused by multifaceted interaction between genetic and environmental factors, which makes identification of the most likely disease candidate proteins and their associated risk markers a big challenge. Atherosclerosis is presented by a broad spectrum of heart diseases, including stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is the progressive stage of SCAD. As such, the correct and prompt diagnosis of atherosclerosis turns into imperative for precise and prompt disease diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. <b>Methods:</b> The current work aims to look for specific protein markers for differential diagnosis of coronary atherosclerosis. Thirty male patients between 45 and 55 years diagnosed with atherosclerosis were analyzed by tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry. The study excluded those who were additionally diagnosed with hypertension and type 1 and 2 diabetes. The Mufuzz analysis was applied to select target proteins for precise and prompt diagnosis of atherosclerosis, most of which were most related to high lipid metabolism. The parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was used to verify the selected target proteins. Finally, The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated by a random forest experiment. <b>Results:</b> One thousand one hundred and forty seven proteins were identified in the TMT mass spectrometry, 907 of which were quantifiable. In the PRM study, six proteins related to lipid metabolism pathway were selected for verification and they were ALB, SHBG, APOC2, APOC3, APOC4, SAA4. <b>Conclusion:</b> Through the detected specific changes in these six proteins, our results provide accuracy in atherosclerosis patients' diagnosis, especially in cases with varying types of the disease.\nDocument [20]: Title: [Analysis of carotid atherosclerosis and related risk factors in a university physical examination population in Beijing]. Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To explore the incidence of carotid atherosclerosis in staffs of Tsinghua university according to the different age groups, the possible risk factors and conduct a follow-up survey. <b>Methods:</b> Detailed information about physical examination and carotid ultrasound from 832 staffs of Tsinghua University between 2014 to 2016 were reviewed to observe the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis according to different age groups; the correlation between conventional risk factors and carotid arteriosclerosis was studied by multivariate Logistic regression analysis.The process of different degrees of arteriosclerosis in the population was observed one year later. <b>Results:</b> In the past three years, there were 2 024 cases of carotid examination. Among them, there were 832 staffs who had been followed up for more than 6 months. There were 517 cases of carotid atherosclerosis, with 289 males (55.9%) and 228 females (44.1%), and the incidence of atherosclerosis in male was higher than that in female (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The 50 to 59 years old, 60 to 69 years old, 70 to79 years old were the age group with high incidence of pure carotid intima-media thickening, atherosclerosis plaque formation and stenosis or occlusion, respectively. After multivariate Logistic regression analysis, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia were found the independent risk factors for carotid intimal thickening. The follow-up of 832 staffs with ultrasound showed that there was no significant difference in intima-media thickening, plaque formation, stenosis or occlusion after one year (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> This research suggests that the incidence of atherosclerosis in male is higher than that in female, and hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia are important influencing factors of arteriosclerosis for staffs of Tsinghua University. Early screening, identification of high-risk patients and comprehensive treatment should be done to delay the process of atherosclerosis.In addition, long-term follow-up is necessary in the context of no significant changes within the short-term.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: It has been known for decades that the maize B chromosome undergoes nondisjunction at the second pollen mitosis. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) was used to undertake a quantitative study of maize plants with differing numbers of B chromosomes to observe if instability increases by increasing B dosage in root tip tissue. B chromosome nondisjunction was basically absent at low copy number, but increased at higher B numbers. Thus, B nondisjunction rates are dependent on the dosage of B's in the sporophyte. Differences in nondisjunction were also documented between odd and even doses of the B. In plants that have inherited odd numbered doses of the B chromosome, B loss is nearly twice as likely as B gain in a somatic division. When comparing plants with even doses of B's to plants with odd doses of B's, plants with even numbers had a significantly higher chance to increase in number. Therefore, the B's non-disjunctive capacity, previously thought to be primarily restricted to the gametophyte, is present in sporophytic cells.\nDocument [2]: Title: Missed connections: recombination and human aneuploidy. Abstract: The physical exchange of DNA between homologs, crossing-over, is essential to orchestrate the unique, reductional first meiotic division (MI). In females, the events of meiotic recombination that serve to tether homologs and facilitate their disjunction at MI occur during fetal development, preceding the MI division by several decades in our species. Data from studies in humans and mice demonstrate that placement of recombination sites during fetal development influences the likelihood of an MI nondisjunction event that results in the production of an aneuploid egg. Here we briefly summarize what we know about the relationship between aneuploidy and meiotic recombination and important considerations for the future of human assisted reproduction.\nDocument [3]: Title: Dad 'never said much' but\u2026 Young Men and Great War Veterans in Day-to-Day-Life in Interwar Britain. Abstract: This article explores whether, how, and what young men in interwar Britain heard about the Great War from its veterans. Oral histories are used to enable the first detailed examination of the hitherto largely unexplored topic of the intergenerational transmission of representations of the Great War in interwar Britain. It shows that although many veterans were reticent about their war experiences, young men heard about Great War experiences from veterans more frequently than has previously been acknowledged. What they heard was heterogeneous, like representations in popular culture, but tended to emphasize positive and rewarding elements of wartime service rather than disillusion. While veterans' narratives could be fleeting and ephemeral, this examination of their character shows they should be considered an important component of the wider body of representations of the Great War in interwar popular culture through which young men might 'know' about the Great War. As well as examining what young men heard, consideration is given to alternative ways that young men learned about familial service, and to what triggered veterans' narratives and why some remained silent. Reasons for the trope of the silent veteran are suggested, and its strength in contemporary popular memory is illustrated in discussion of the 'discomposure' it could cause some interviewees.\nDocument [4]: Title: From the Cover: Does the Assessment of Nondisjunction Provide a More Sensitive Assay for the Detection of Aneugens? Abstract: The detection of aneugenic chemicals is important due to the implications of aneuploidy for human health. Aneuploidy can result from chromosome loss or nondisjunction due to chromosome mis-segregation at anaphase. Frequently, aneugens are detected using the in vitro micronucleus assay (IVM), with either centromere or kinetochore labeling. However, this method does not consider nondisjunction, the suggested predominant mechanism of spindle poison induced aneugenicity in primary human lymphocytes. Therefore, the IVM may be relatively insensitive in detecting aneuploidy. To investigate whether chromosome distribution analysis, specifically of nondisjunction, using chromosome-specific centromeric probes provides a more sensitive assay for aneugen detection, six reference aneugens with differing modes of action were tested on human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. The results show that chromosome loss is a substantial part of the process leading to aneuploidy in TK6 cells. This differs from previous studies on human lymphocytes where nondisjunction has been described as the major mechanism of aneugenicity. However, in the current study more cells and types of aneugenic damage were analyzed. Although compound specific effects on nondisjunction were identified, chromosome distribution analysis did not provide increased sensitivity for the detection of aneugens: For the six reference aneugens examined, chromosome loss was shown at the same concentrations or lower than nondisjunction, even when nondisjunction levels were comparatively high. Therefore, in TK6 cells methods that detect chromosome loss, eg, the IVM, provide a more sensitive technique for the detection of aneugens than the measurement of nondisjunction.\nDocument [5]: Title: Maternal age and risk for trisomy 21 assessed by the origin of chromosome nondisjunction: a report from the Atlanta and National Down Syndrome Projects. Abstract: We examined the association between maternal age and chromosome 21 nondisjunction by origin of the meiotic error. We analyzed data from two population-based, case-control studies: Atlanta Down Syndrome Project (1989-1999) and National Down Syndrome Project (2001-2004). Cases were live born infants with trisomy 21 and controls were infants without trisomy 21 delivered in the same geographical regions. We enrolled 1,215 of 1,881 eligible case families and 1,375 of 2,293 controls. We report four primary findings. First, the significant association between advanced maternal age and chromosome 21 nondisjunction was restricted to meiotic errors in the egg; the association was not observed in sperm or in post-zygotic mitotic errors. Second, advanced maternal age was significantly associated with both meiosis I (MI) and meiosis II (MII). For example, compared to mothers of controls, mothers of infants with trisomy 21 due to MI nondisjunction were 8.5 times more likely to be >or=40 years old than 20-24 years old at the birth of the index case (95% CI=5.6-12.9). Where nondisjunction occurred in MII, mothers were 15.1 times more likely to be >or=40 years (95% CI = 8.4-27.3). Third, the ratio of MI to MII errors differed by maternal age. The ratio was lower among women <19 years of age and those >or=40 years (2.1, 2.3, respectively) and higher in the middle age group (3.6). Lastly, we found no effect of grand-maternal age on the risk for maternal nondisjunction. This study emphasizes the complex association between advanced maternal age and nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during oogenesis.\nDocument [6]: Title: [Chromosome nondisjunction in Drosophila strains mutant for tumor suppressor Merlin]. Abstract: The effect of mutation for gene Merlin on chromosome disjunction in Drosophila during meiosis was genetically studied. Chromosome nondisjunction was not registered in females heterozygous for this mutation and containing structurally normal X chromosomes. In cases when these females additionally contained inversion in one of chromosomes X, a tendency toward the appearance of nondisjunction events was observed in individuals containing mutation in the heterozygote. The genetic construct was obtained allowing the overexpression of protein corresponding to a sterile allele Mer3 in the germ cell line. This construct relieves the lethal effect of Mer4 mutation. The ectopic expression of this mutant protein leads to chromosome nondisjunction in male meiosis.\nDocument [7]: Title: Genetic aetiology of Down syndrome birth: novel variants of maternal DNMT3B and RFC1 genes increase risk of meiosis II nondisjunction in the oocyte. Abstract: The aim of the present work was to explore the intriguing association of maternal folate regulator gene polymorphisms and mutations with the incidence of chromosome 21 nondisjunction and Down syndrome birth. We tested polymorphisms/mutations of DNMT3B and RFC1 genes for their association with meiotic errors in oocyte among the 1215 Down syndrome child-bearing women and 900 controls. We observed that 23 out of 31 variants of DNMT3B and RFC1 exhibited an association with meiosis II nondisjunction in maternal age-independent manner. Additionally, we have reported 17 novel mutations and 1 novel polymorphic variant that are unique to the Indian Bengali speaking cohort and increased odds in favour of meiosis II nondisjunction. We hypothesize that the risk variants and mutations of DNMT3B and RFC1 genes may cause reduction in two or more recombination events and also cause peri-centromeric single exchange that increases the risk of nondisjunction at any age of women. In silico analyses predicted the probable damages of the transcripts or proteins from the respective genes owing to the said polymorphisms. These findings from the largest population sample tested ever revealed that mutations/polymorphisms of the genes DNMT3B and RFC1 impair recombination that leads to chromosome 21 nondisjunction in the oocyte at meiosis II stage and bring us a significant step closer towards understanding the aetiology of chromosome 21 nondisjunction and birth of a child with Down syndrome to women at any age.\nDocument [8]: Title: New insights into human nondisjunction of chromosome 21 in oocytes. Abstract: Nondisjunction of chromosome 21 is the leading cause of Down syndrome. Two risk factors for maternal nondisjunction of chromosome 21 are increased maternal age and altered recombination. In order to provide further insight on mechanisms underlying nondisjunction, we examined the association between these two well established risk factors for chromosome 21 nondisjunction. In our approach, short tandem repeat markers along chromosome 21 were genotyped in DNA collected from individuals with free trisomy 21 and their parents. This information was used to determine the origin of the nondisjunction error and the maternal recombination profile. We analyzed 615 maternal meiosis I and 253 maternal meiosis II cases stratified by maternal age. The examination of meiosis II errors, the first of its type, suggests that the presence of a single exchange within the pericentromeric region of 21q interacts with maternal age-related risk factors. This observation could be explained in two general ways: 1) a pericentromeric exchange initiates or exacerbates the susceptibility to maternal age risk factors or 2) a pericentromeric exchange protects the bivalent against age-related risk factors allowing proper segregation of homologues at meiosis I, but not segregation of sisters at meiosis II. In contrast, analysis of maternal meiosis I errors indicates that a single telomeric exchange imposes the same risk for nondisjunction, irrespective of the age of the oocyte. Our results emphasize the fact that human nondisjunction is a multifactorial trait that must be dissected into its component parts to identify specific associated risk factors.\nDocument [9]: Title: Isolation and cytogenetic characterization of male meiotic mutants of Drosophila melanogaster. Abstract: Proper segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I is ensured by pairing of homologs and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion. In male Drosophila melanogaster, meiosis is achiasmatic and homologs pair at limited chromosome regions called pairing sites. We screened for male meiotic mutants to identify genes required for normal pairing and disjunction of homologs. Nondisjunction of the sex and the fourth chromosomes in male meiosis was scored as a mutant phenotype. We screened 2306 mutagenized and 226 natural population-derived second and third chromosomes and obtained seven mutants representing different loci on the second chromosome and one on the third. Five mutants showed relatively mild effects (<10% nondisjunction). mei(2)yh149 and mei(2)yoh7134 affected both the sex and the fourth chromosomes, mei(2)yh217 produced possible sex chromosome-specific nondisjunction, and mei(2)yh15 and mei(2)yh137 produced fourth chromosome-specific nondisjunction. mei(2)yh137 was allelic to the teflon gene required for autosomal pairing. Three mutants exhibited severe defects, producing >10% nondisjunction of the sex and/or the fourth chromosomes. mei(2)ys91 (a new allele of the orientation disruptor gene) and mei(3)M20 induced precocious separation of sister chromatids as early as prometa-phase I. mei(2)yh92 predominantly induced nondisjunction at meiosis I that appeared to be the consequence of failure of the separation of paired homologous chromosomes.\nDocument [10]: Title: Transcription of ribosomal genes can cause nondisjunction. Abstract: Mitotic disjunction of the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) involves specialized segregation mechanisms dependent on the conserved phosphatase Cdc14. The reason behind this requirement is unknown. We show that rDNA segregation requires Cdc14 partly because of its physical length but most importantly because a fraction of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are transcribed at very high rates. We show that cells cannot segregate rDNA without Cdc14 unless they undergo genetic rearrangements that reduce rDNA copy number. We then demonstrate that cells with normal length rDNA arrays can segregate rDNA in the absence of Cdc14 as long as rRNA genes are not transcribed. In addition, our study uncovers an unexpected role for the replication barrier protein Fob1 in rDNA segregation that is independent of Cdc14. These findings demonstrate that highly transcribed loci can cause chromosome nondisjunction.\nDocument [11]: Title: Analysis of B chromosome nondisjunction induced by the r-X1 deficiency in maize. Abstract: The maize B chromosome typically undergoes nondisjunction during the second microspore division. For normal A chromosomes, the r-X1 deficiency in maize can induce nondisjunction during the second megaspore and first microspore divisions. However, it is not known whether the r-X1 deficiency also induces nondisjunction of the maize B chromosome during these cell divisions. To answer this question, chromosome numbers were determined in the progeny of r-X1/R-r female parents carrying two B chromosomes. Some of the r-X1-lacking progeny (21.2%) contained zero or two B chromosomes. However, a much higher percentage of the r-X1-containing progeny (43.4%) exhibited zero or two B chromosomes, but none displayed more than two B chromosomes. Thus, the results indicated that the r-X1 deficiency could also induce nondisjunction of the B chromosome during the second megaspore division; moreover, the B chromosome in itself could undergo nondisjunction during the same division. In addition, pollen grains from plants with two B chromosomes lacking or exhibiting the r-X1 deficiency were compared via pollen fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a B chromosome-specific probe. The results revealed that the r-X1 deficiency could induce the occurrence of B chromosome nondisjunction during the first microspore division and that the B chromosome in itself could undergo nondisjunction during the same division at a lower frequency. Our data shed more light on the behavior of the maize B chromosome during cell division.\nDocument [12]: Title: Spore-autonomous fluorescent protein expression identifies meiotic chromosome mis-segregation as the principal cause of hybrid sterility in yeast. Abstract: Genome-wide sequence divergence between populations can cause hybrid sterility through the action of the anti-recombination system, which rejects crossover repair of double strand breaks between nonidentical sequences. Because crossovers are necessary to ensure proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, the reduced recombination rate in hybrids can result in high levels of nondisjunction and therefore low gamete viability. Hybrid sterility in interspecific crosses of Saccharomyces yeasts is known to be associated with such segregation errors, but estimates of the importance of nondisjunction to postzygotic reproductive isolation have been hampered by difficulties in accurately measuring nondisjunction frequencies. Here, we use spore-autonomous fluorescent protein expression to quantify nondisjunction in both interspecific and intraspecific yeast hybrids. We show that segregation is near random in interspecific hybrids. The observed rates of nondisjunction can explain most of the sterility observed in interspecific hybrids through the failure of gametes to inherit at least one copy of each chromosome. Partially impairing the anti-recombination system by preventing expression of the RecQ helicase SGS1 during meiosis cuts nondisjunction frequencies in half. We further show that chromosome loss through nondisjunction can explain nearly all of the sterility observed in hybrids formed between two populations of a single species. The rate of meiotic nondisjunction of each homologous pair was negatively correlated with chromosome size in these intraspecific hybrids. Our results demonstrate that sequence divergence is not only associated with the sterility of hybrids formed between distantly related species but may also be a direct cause of reproductive isolation in incipient species.\nDocument [13]: Title: Centromere function and nondisjunction are independent components of the maize B chromosome accumulation mechanism. Abstract: Supernumerary or B chromosomes are selfish entities that maintain themselves in populations by accumulation mechanisms. The accumulation mechanism of the B chromosome of maize (Zea mays) involves nondisjunction at the second pollen mitosis, placing two copies of the B chromosome into one of the two sperm. The B chromosome long arm must be present in the same nucleus for the centromere to undergo nondisjunction. A centromere, containing all of the normal DNA elements, translocated from the B chromosome to the short arm of chromosome 9 was recently found to be epigenetically silenced for centromeric function. When intact B chromosomes were added to this genotype, thus supplying the long arm, the inactive centromere regained the property of nondisjunction causing the translocation chromosome 9 to be differentially distributed to the two sperm or resulted in chromosome breaks in 9S, occasionally producing new translocations. Translocation of the inactive B centromere to chromosome 7 transferred the nondisjunction property to this chromosome. The results provide insight into the molecular and evolutionary basis of this B chromosome accumulation mechanism by demonstrating that nondisjunction is caused by a process that does not depend on normal centromere function but that the region of the chromosome required for nondisjunction resides in the centromeric region.\nDocument [14]: Title: Chromosome nondisjunction yields tetraploid rather than aneuploid cells in human cell lines. Abstract: Although mutations in cell cycle regulators or spindle proteins can perturb chromosome segregation, the causes and consequences of spontaneous mitotic chromosome nondisjunction in human cells are not well understood. It has been assumed that nondisjunction of a chromosome during mitosis will yield two aneuploid daughter cells. Here we show that chromosome nondisjunction is tightly coupled to regulation of cytokinesis in human cell lines, such that nondisjunction results in the formation of tetraploid rather than aneuploid cells. We observed that spontaneously arising binucleated cells exhibited chromosome mis-segregation rates up to 166-fold higher than the overall mitotic population. Long-term imaging experiments indicated that most binucleated cells arose through a bipolar mitosis followed by regression of the cleavage furrow hours later. Nondisjunction occurred with high frequency in cells that became binucleated by furrow regression, but not in cells that completed cytokinesis to form two mononucleated cells. Our findings indicate that nondisjunction does not directly yield aneuploid cells, but rather tetraploid cells that may subsequently become aneuploid through further division. The coupling of spontaneous segregation errors to furrow regression provides a potential explanation for the prevalence of hyperdiploid chromosome number and centrosome amplification observed in many cancers.\nDocument [15]: Title: Risk factors for nondisjunction of trisomy 21. Abstract: The leading cause of Down syndrome (DS) is nondisjunction of chromosome 21 occurring during the formation of gametes. In this review, we discuss the progress made to identify risk factors associated with this type of chromosome error occurring in oogenesis and spermatogenesis. For errors occurring in oocytes, the primary risk factors are maternal age and altered recombination. We review the current progress made with respect to these factors and briefly outline the potential environmental and genetic influences that may play a role. Although the studies of paternal nondisjunction are limited due to the relatively small proportion of errors of this type, we review the potential influence of paternal age, recombination and other environmental and genetic factors on susceptibility. Although progress has been made to understand the mechanisms and risk factors that underlie nondisjunction, considerably more research needs to be conducted to dissect this multifactorial trait, one that has a considerable impact on our species.\nDocument [16]: Title: A candidate gene analysis and GWAS for genes associated with maternal nondisjunction of chromosome 21. Abstract: Human nondisjunction errors in oocytes are the leading cause of pregnancy loss, and for pregnancies that continue to term, the leading cause of intellectual disabilities and birth defects. For the first time, we have conducted a candidate gene and genome-wide association study to identify genes associated with maternal nondisjunction of chromosome 21 as a first step to understand predisposing factors. A total of 2,186 study participants were genotyped on the HumanOmniExpressExome-8v1-2 array. These participants included 749 live birth offspring with standard trisomy 21 and 1,437 parents. Genotypes from the parents and child were then used to identify mothers with nondisjunction errors derived in the oocyte and to establish the type of error (meiosis I or meiosis II). We performed a unique set of subgroup comparisons designed to leverage our previous work suggesting that the etiologies of meiosis I and meiosis II nondisjunction differ for trisomy 21. For the candidate gene analysis, we selected genes associated with chromosome dynamics early in meiosis and genes associated with human global recombination counts. Several candidate genes showed strong associations with maternal nondisjunction of chromosome 21, demonstrating that genetic variants associated with normal variation in meiotic processes can be risk factors for nondisjunction. The genome-wide analysis also suggested several new potentially associated loci, although follow-up studies using independent samples are required.\nDocument [17]: Title: [Longer oral contraception history as a possible preventive factor against fetal trisomy 21 in advanced maternal age pregnancies]. Abstract: Down syndrome is the most common autosomal chromosomal abnormality. According to the classical interpretation, it is the result of meiotic nondisjunction. Its occurrence is more common in advanced maternal age. Despite intensive research, pathophysiology of this genetic disorder is not fully understood. According to recent studies, a different kind of mechanism may be found in the background of trisomy 21 than was previously considered. Based on the ovarian mosaicism model, the cause of trisomy 21 (or any common trisomy) is a segregation error of a chromosome in premeiotic mitosis. The cell entering meiosis will be an oocyte with preexisting trisomy, where its (so-called \"secondary\") nondisjunction is essential. Maturation of the trisomic oocytes appears to fall behind the disomic oocytes, resulting in their relative accumulation in the ovaries as time progresses. The ratio of trisomic/disomic cells becomes less favorable in maternal maturity. If ovulation is inhibited - although the number of oocytes will continue to decline due to apoptosis - it can be assumed that the trisomic/disomic oocyte ratio remains more favorable with the progression of age. In our summary report, presenting and updating our previous data, we would like to propose that - according to ovarian mosaicism model - long-term oral contraception in the anamnesis may be beneficial in pregnancies with advanced maternal age.

Abstract: Chromosome 21 nondisjunction in oocytes is the most common cause of trisomy 21, the primary chromosomal abnormality responsible for Down syndrome (DS). This specific type of error is estimated to account for over 90 % of live births with DS, with maternal age being the best known risk factor for chromosome 21 nondisjunction. The loss of telomere length and the concomitant shortening of chromosomes are considered a biological marker for aging. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that mothers who had a maternal nondisjunction error leading to a live birth with DS (n = 404) have shorter telomeres than mothers with live births without DS (n = 42). In effect, our hypothesis suggests that mothers of children with DS will appear \"biologically older\" as compared to the mothers of euploid children. We applied a quantitative PCR assay to measure the genome-wide relative telomere length to test this hypothesis. The results of our study support the hypothesis that young mothers of DS babies are \"biologically older\" than mothers of euploid babies in the same age group and supports telomere length as a biomarker of age and hence risk for chromosome nondisjunction.\nDocument [19]: Title: Statistical analysis of nondisjunction assays in Drosophila. Abstract: Many advances in the understanding of meiosis have been made by measuring how often errors in chromosome segregation occur. This process of nondisjunction can be studied by counting experimental progeny, but direct measurement of nondisjunction rates is complicated by not all classes of nondisjunctional progeny being viable. For X chromosome nondisjunction in Drosophila female meiosis, all of the normal progeny survive, while nondisjunctional eggs produce viable progeny only if fertilized by sperm that carry the appropriate sex chromosome. The rate of nondisjunction has traditionally been estimated by assuming a binomial process and doubling the number of observed nondisjunctional progeny, to account for the inviable classes. However, the correct way to derive statistics (such as confidence intervals or hypothesis testing) by this approach is far from clear. Instead, we use the multinomial-Poisson hierarchy model and demonstrate that the old estimator is in fact the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE). Under more general assumptions, we derive asymptotic normality of this estimator and construct confidence interval and hypothesis testing formulae. Confidence intervals under this framework are always larger than under the binomial framework, and application to published data shows that use of the multinomial approach can avoid an apparent type 1 error made by use of the binomial assumption. The current study provides guidance for researchers designing genetic experiments on nondisjunction and improves several methods for the analysis of genetic data.\nDocument [20]: Title: Angelman syndrome with mosaic paternal uniparental disomy suggestive of mitotic nondisjunction. Abstract: Angelman syndrome (AS) is caused by the functional absence of the maternal ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. Approximately 5% of AS is caused by paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (UPD(15)pat), most of which is considered to result from monosomy rescue. However, little attention has focused on how UPD(15)pat occurs. We suggest the mitotic nondisjunction mechanism as a cause of UPD(15)pat in a six-year-old patient presenting with distinctive characteristics in line with AS. DNA methylation screening of 15q11-q13 showed a paternal band and a faint maternal band, suggestive of mosaic status. By trio-based microsatellite analysis, we confirmed a large proportion of UPD(15)pat cells and a small proportion of cells of biparental origin. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray revealed isodisomy of the entire chromosome 15. These results suggest that the UPD(15)pat of the patient resulted from mitotic nondisjunction, which may also be the cause of other cases of AS with UPD(15)pat.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: The diagnosis of advanced heart failure (HF) is established in patients for whom symptoms are refractory to guideline-directed therapies. Palliative care (PC) is based on symptom management and support of the patient and family, making its integration into the care of those with advanced HF essential. Comorbidities including frailty, cognitive dysfunction, and depression are often under-recognized in patients with advanced HF and may correlate with outcomes. Decisions should be based on the patient's values, goals agreed upon by the clinician with the patient, and what is medically reasonable. Palliative Care should be integrated to help with both palliation of symptoms and support for families and patients.\nDocument [2]: Title: Heart Failure: A Palliative Medicine Review of Disease, Therapies, and Medications With a Focus on Symptoms, Function, and Quality of Life. Abstract: Despite significant advances in heart failure (HF) treatment, HF remains a progressive, extremely symptomatic, and terminal disease with a median survival of 2.1 years after diagnosis. HF often leads to a constellation of symptoms, including dyspnea, fatigue, depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, and worsened cognitive function. Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their caregivers facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness and therefore is well suited to support these patients. However, historically, palliative care has often focused on supporting patients with malignant disease, rather than a progressive chronic disease such as HF. Predicting mortality in patients with HF is challenging. The lack of obvious transition points in disease progression also raises challenges to primary care providers and specialists to know at what point to integrate palliative care during a patient's disease trajectory. Although therapies for HF often result in functional and symptomatic improvements including health-related quality of life (HRQL), some patients with HF do not demonstrate these benefits, including those patients with a preserved ejection fraction. Provision of palliative care for patients with HF requires an understanding of HF pathogenesis and common medications used for these patients, as well as an approach to balancing life-prolonging and HRQL care strategies. This review describes HF and current targeted therapies and their effects on symptoms, hospital admission rates, exercise performance, HRQL, and survival. Pharmacological interactions with and precautions related to commonly used palliative care medications are reviewed. The goal of this review is to equip palliative care clinicians with information to make evidence-based decisions while managing the balance between optimal disease management and patient quality of life.\nDocument [3]: Title: Palliative Care in the Management of Patients with Advanced Heart Failure. Abstract: Globally, there are 18-million individuals living with heart failure, a disease that is responsible for 12-15 million office visits and 6.5 million inpatient hospitalizations each year. As HF becomes advanced or end-stage, patients often live in a cycle of frequent transitions between care settings, and with unmet needs, including distress from inadequately managed symptoms. Prognostication in patients with heart failure can be challenging due to the unpredictable exacerbating-remitting illness trajectory that is associated with this progressive disease. Recurrent hospitalizations, worsening functional status and refractory symptoms, despite optimal therapies, are among the most salient predictors indicating that patients with advanced heart failure are nearing the end of life. Palliative care is a specialized form of medical care that has been shown to help improve severity of symptoms, facilitate discussions regarding medical decision making/advance care planning, and provide support for patients and their families. Palliative care can be used alongside curative treatments and has been shown to improve patient satisfaction and quality of life. Anorexia-cachexia syndrome, dyspnea, fatigue, pain and depression are among the most common symptoms experienced by patients suffering from advanced heart failure. Palliative care can help alleviate these symptoms and also facilitate conversations about decision making surrounding resuscitation status and use or deactivation of medical devices, such as an implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association report that aggressive life-sustaining treatments and therapies should not be utilized in patients with advanced heart failure who have refractory symptoms that are not responding to medical therapy. The focus of care should switch to controlling symptoms, reducing hospital admissions and improving health-related quality of life, which can be supported by the incorporation of palliative care into the treatment plan.\nDocument [4]: Title: Ten Questions and Some Reflections about Palliative Care in Advanced Heart Failure Patients. Abstract: Heart failure is a clinical syndrome with increasing prevalence, high morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by high symptom burden, poor quality of life and high economic costs. This implies that the heart failure (HF) patients who receive palliative care (PC) have needs similar to cancer patients, but which are often unmet. This paper analyzes the main unresolved issues regarding the relationship between HF patients and the referral to an early PC program. These issues are presented as ten questions related to which patients should be admitted to PC and at what stage of their disease. Furthermore, the barriers opposing to referral to PC, the role of cardiologists and PC physicians within the care team, the gap between the scientific societies' suggestions and the real world, the right time to promote patients' awareness and shared decision making, regarding prognosis, end of life wishes and choices, with reference also to cardiac implantable devices' deactivation, are discussed. These unresolved questions support the need to reevaluate programs and specific models in achieving equal access to palliative care interventions for HF patients, which is still mainly offered to patients with cancer.\nDocument [5]: Title: End-of-Life Decisions and Palliative Care in Advanced Heart Failure. Abstract: Advanced heart failure (HF) therapies are focused on extending life and improving function. In contrast, palliative care is a holistic approach that focuses on symptom alleviation and patients' physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs. HF clinicians can integrate palliative care strategies by incorporating several important components of planning and decision-making for HF patients. Future care planning (FCP) for HF patients should incorporate the basic tenets of shared decision-making (SDM). These include understanding the patient's perspective and care preferences, articulating what is medically feasible, and integrating these considerations into the overall care plan. Use of defined triggers for FCP can stimulate important patient-caregiver conversations. Guidelines advocate an annual review of HF status and future care preferences. Advance directives are important for any individual with a chronic, life-limiting illness and should be integrated into FCP. Nevertheless, use of advance directives by HF patients is extremely low. Consideration of illness trajectories and risk-scoring tools might facilitate prognostication and delivery of appropriate HF care. Decisions about heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device implantation should include planning for potential complications associated with these therapies. Such decisions also should include a discussion of palliative management, as an alternative to intervention and also as an option for managing symptoms or adverse events after intervention. Palliative care, including FCP and SDM, should be integrated into the course of all patients with advanced HF. Clinicians who provide HF care should acquire the skills necessary for conducting FCP and SDM discussions.\nDocument [6]: Title: Rationale and design of the EPCHF trial: the early palliative care in heart failure trial (EPCHF). Abstract: The progressive nature of heart failure (HF) coupled with high mortality and poor quality-of-life (QoL) mandates greater attention to palliative care (PC) as a routine component of HF management. Limited evidence exists from randomized controlled trials supporting the use of interdisciplinary palliative care in the progressive course of HF. The early palliative care in heart failure trial (EPCHF) is a prospective, controlled, nonblinded, multicenter study of an interdisciplinary palliative care intervention in 200 patients with symptomatic HF characterized by NYHA \u2265 2. The 12-month EPCHF intervention includes monthly consultations by a palliative care team focusing on physical and psychosocial symptom relief, attention to spiritual concerns and advance care planning. The primary endpoint is evaluated by health-related QoL questionnaires after 12 months of treatment. First the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy palliative care (FACIT-Pal) score evaluating QoL living with a chronic disease and second the Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire (KCCQ) measuring QoL living with heart failure will be determined. Secondary endpoints are changes in anxiety/depression (HADS), symptom burden score (MIDOS), spiritual well-being functional assessment of chronic illness therapy spiritual well-being scale (FACIT-Sp), medical resource and cost assessment. EPCHF will help evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of palliative care in symptomatic HF using a patient-centered outcome as well as clinical and economic endpoints. EPCHF is funded by the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung (BMBF, 01GY17).\nDocument [7]: Title: Palliative care in patients with heart failure. Abstract: Despite advances in cardiac therapy, heart failure (HF) remains a progressive, highly symptomatic, and deadly disease that places great demands on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to care that focuses on communication, shared decision making, and advance care planning; provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms; integrates psychological and spiritual aspects of care; and offers a support system to help families cope during illness and bereavement. Palliative care has applications across the stages of heart failure, including early in the course of illness, often in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life. However, the incorporation of palliative care into the management of heart failure has been suboptimal for several reasons: uncertainty in the disease trajectory, failure to reward communication between healthcare providers and patients, siloed care, lack of knowledge, overlay of comorbidity and frailty, life saving devices with complex trade-offs, and a limited evidence base. This review will summarize the current literature on the emerging role of palliative care in patients with heart failure and the challenges and opportunities for its integration into routine care. It will discuss current initiatives and future directions of the collaborative relationship between the palliative care and heart failure disciplines.\nDocument [8]: Title: The 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society heart failure management guidelines update: focus on sleep apnea, renal dysfunction, mechanical circulatory support, and palliative care. Abstract: The 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Heart Failure (HF) Guidelines Focused Update reviews the recently published clinical trials that will potentially impact on management. Also reviewed is the less studied but clinically important area of sleep apnea. Finally, patients with advanced HF represent a group of patients who pose major difficulties to clinicians. Advanced HF therefore is examined from the perspectives of HF complicated by renal failure, the role of palliative care, and the role of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). All of these topics are reviewed from a perspective of practical applications. Important new studies have demonstrated in less symptomatic HF patients that cardiac resynchronization therapy will be of benefit. As well, aldosterone receptor antagonists can be used with benefit in less symptomatic HF patients. The important role of palliative care and the need to address end-of-life issues in advanced HF are emphasized. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of sleep apnea complicating the course of HF and the role of a sleep study for the proper assessment and management of the conditon. Patients with either acute severe or chronic advanced HF with otherwise good life expectancy should be referred to a cardiac centre capable of providing MCS. Furthermore, patients awaiting heart transplantation who deteriorate or are otherwise not likely to survive until a donor organ is found should be referred for MCS.\nDocument [9]: Title: Pediatric Palliative Care in the Heart Failure, Ventricular Assist Device and Transplant Populations: Supporting Patients, Families and Their Clinical Teams. Abstract: Heart failure is a life-changing diagnosis for a child and their family. Pediatric patients with heart failure experience significant morbidity and frequent hospitalizations, and many require advanced therapies such as mechanical circulatory support and/or heart transplantation. Pediatric palliative care is an integral resource for the care of patients with heart failure along its continuum. This includes support during the grief of a new diagnosis in a child critically ill with decompensated heart failure, discussion of goals of care and the complexities of mechanical circulatory support, the pensive wait for heart transplantation, and symptom management and psychosocial support throughout the journey. In this article, we discuss the scope of pediatric palliative care in the realm of pediatric heart failure, ventricular assist device (VAD) support, and heart transplantation. We review the limited, albeit growing, literature in this field, with an added focus on difficult conversation and decision support surrounding re-transplantation, HF in young adults with congenital heart disease, the possibility of destination therapy VAD, and the grimmest decision of VAD de-activation.\nDocument [10]: Title: Palliative care for end-stage heart failure. Abstract: Heart failure is growing in prevalence. Despite an array of treatments targeting a complicated pathophysiology, heart failure ultimately leads to death, and thus there is a clear need to provide palliative care to persons with end-stage heart failure. Palliative care, or education and support of the patient and family and management of distressing symptoms, should be provided throughout the course of the illness. Clinicians need additional information about how to palliate symptoms in advanced heart failure. This article summarizes recent reports about prognostication and identification of patients who are likely to die soon, and the management of fatigue, dyspnea, pain, and depression in heart failure. Palliative care or supportive care of the patient and family should be incorporated into comprehensive care throughout the course of heart failure. Data about hospice care for persons with heart failure are summarized.\nDocument [11]: Title: Palliative care in heart failure guidelines: A comparison of the 2021 ESC and the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guidelines on heart failure. Abstract: The role of palliative care for patients with heart failure (HF) is discussed in both most recent HF guidelines, the 2021 ESC guideline and the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline. This review compares the definitions, concepts and specific recommendations regarding palliative care for patients with HF in these two guidelines. Both HF guidelines define palliative care as a multidisciplinary approach aimed at alleviating physical, psychological and spiritual distress of patients and caregivers. Both agree emphatically on the importance of palliative care across all stages of HF with integration early in the illness trajectory. Also, the guidelines concur that palliative care should include symptom management, communication about prognosis and life-sustaining therapies, as well as advance care planning. Despite this consensus, only the AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline gives official recommendations on the provision of palliative care. Moreover, the AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline advocates for a needs-based approach to palliative care allocation while the ESC guideline ties palliative care closely to advanced HF and end-of-life care. The ESC guideline highlights the need for regular symptom assessment and provides detailed guidance on symptom management. The AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline elaborates further on shared decision-making, caregiver and bereavement support, as well as hospice care, and distinguishes between primary palliative care (provided by all clinicians) and secondary (specialty-level) palliative care. Although there is strong agreement on the importance and components of palliative care for patients with HF, there are nuanced differences between the two HF guidelines. Most notably, only the AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline issues recommendations for the provision of palliative care.\nDocument [12]: Title: Uncertainties of the heart: palliative care and adult heart failure. Abstract: Chronic heart failure (HF) is a growing public health concern in Western nations. Incidence of HF increases with age, and demographics in the United States support a growing HF population. Annually, more than 100,000 people are admitted to hospitals because of HF. Patients with chronic HF experience a highly morbid and life-limiting illness while suffering from substantial physical and psychosocial burdens. What is the state of the science regarding the use of palliative care for community-dwelling adult patients with HF? A review of the scientific literature was conducted using the key words \"palliative care\" and \"heart failure\" in several electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline, Proquest) from October 15 to November 15, 2011. Eleven of the 16 articles found indicated that palliative care is underused by HF patients. There is a large unmet care need for adults with chronic HF and their family caregivers. Home healthcare professionals develop and maintain relationships with community-dwelling patients with chronic HF over the course of their HF illness trajectory. Home healthcare professionals are in a unique position to identify HF patients who may benefit from palliative care programs delivered across care settings in the community. By developing ongoing relationships with patients and their family caregivers, we are able to focus on the complete care needs of this patient population and assist them with advanced care planning, psychological and social issues, and symptom management. We can also improve communication among care providers and patients/families to identify goals of care along the trajectory of HF illness.\nDocument [13]: Title: [Palliative care in the cardiac setting: a consensus document of the Italian Society of Cardiology/Italian Society of Palliative Care (SIC/SICP)]. Abstract: Palliative care is recognized as an approach that improves quality of life of patients and families facing life-threatening illnesses. This is achieved through prevention, early identification, assessment and treatment of symptoms and other psycho-social, spiritual and economic issues. Palliative care is not dependent on prognosis and can be delivered as \"simultaneous care\", together with disease-modifying treatments and adequate symptom relief. Palliative care relies on coordination across settings of care and offers open communication to patients and caregivers. Recently, there is increasing interest in the potential role of palliative care in refractory, advanced heart failure treated with optimal, maximized therapy.Heart failure is a chronic progressive syndrome characterized by periods of stability interrupted by acute exacerbations, usually leading to reduced functional status. It accounts for approximately one-third of deaths in industrialized countries and is a common cause of hospitalization. Fifty percent of patients with advanced heart failure die within 1 year of diagnosis and 50% of the remainder within 5 years. The trajectory of heart failure is often unpredictable and approximately 30% to 50% of patients die suddenly. Patients with heart failure suffer from numerous symptoms, often resistant to conventional treatments, frequently under-recognized and under-treated. Symptom assessment and control improve quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure; this can be managed at best by collaboration between specialistic teams.Although heart failure is a life-shortening condition, therapeutic and technological advances (such as left ventricular assist devices, coronary revascularization, percutaneous valve implantation, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators) can help healthcare professionals in the management of patients with advanced heart failure, improving global condition and reducing the risk of sudden death. On the other hand, it has to be acknowledged that management of cardiovascular implanted electronic devices towards end of life requires awareness of legal, ethical, religious principles regarding potential withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies.Adequate communication with patients regarding adverse events, end of life, benefits vs burdens of therapies and interventions, treatment preferences, and decision-making should be an issue in early stages of disease. The process of advanced care planning should be clearly documented and regularly reviewed.Barriers to the provision of palliative care in heart failure include clinical issues (disease trajectory), prognostic uncertainty, failure in identification of patients who need palliative care and timing of referral to specialist services, but also misconceptions of patients, families and sanitary staff regarding the role of palliative care, organization problems, and finally educational and time issues.This document focuses on the need of further, coordinated research and work-out on: (i) identification of heart failure patients eligible for palliative care, in terms of clinical and social-psychological issues, (ii) identification of trigger events and timing of referral; (iii) identification of adequate performance indicators/scales for measurement, assessment and follow-up of symptoms and quality of life in end-stage heart failure, including patient-reported outcome measures; (iv) treatment, care and organization strategies and models for advanced/end-stage heart failure (\"care management\"); and (v) implementation of knowledge and education of healthcare professionals in the fields of communication, ethics, and\nDocument [14]: Title: Failing the failing heart: a review of palliative care in heart failure. Abstract: Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospital admission for patients older than 65 years. With an aging population and improving survival in heart failure patients, the number of people living with HF continues to grow. As this population increases, the importance of treating symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, pain, and depression that diminish the quality of life in HF patients becomes increasingly important. Palliative care has been shown to help alleviate these symptoms and improve patients' satisfaction with the care they receive. Despite this growing body of evidence, palliative care consultation remains underutilized and is not standard practice in the management of HF. With an emphasis on communication, symptom management, and coordinated care, palliative care provides an integrated approach to support patients and families with chronic illnesses. Early communication with patients and families regarding the unpredictable nature of HF and the increased risk of sudden cardiac death enables discussions around advanced care directives, health care proxies, and deactivation of permanent pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Cardiologists and primary care physicians who are comfortable initiating these discussions are encouraged to do so; however, many fear destroying hope and are uncertain how to discuss end-of-life issues. Thus, in order to facilitate these discussions and establish an appropriate relationship, we recommend that patients and families be introduced to a palliative care team at the earliest appropriate time after diagnosis.\nDocument [15]: Title: Palliative care and hospice in advanced heart failure. Abstract: Advanced heart failure (HF) is a disease process that carries a high burden of symptoms, suffering, and death. Palliative care can complement traditional care to improve symptom amelioration, patient-caregiver communication, emotional support, and medical decision making. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the integration of palliative care into the overall care of patients with HF and some recent evidence of increased use, palliative therapies remain underused in the treatment of advanced HF. Review of the literature reveals that although barriers to integrating palliative care are not fully understood, difficult prognostication combined with caregiver inexperience with end-of-life issues specific to advanced HF is likely to contribute. In this review, we have outlined the general need for palliative care in advanced HF, detailed how palliative measures can be integrated into the care of those having this disease, and explored end-of-life issues specific to these patients.\nDocument [16]: Title: Application of Transformational Leadership Principles in the Development and Integration of Palliative Care Within an Advanced Heart Failure Program. Abstract: Heart failure (HF) is a major health problem in United States, and it has reached epidemic proportions. Heart failure is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Although the prognosis of HF is worse than many forms of cancer, many patients, families, and clinicians are unaware of the dire prognosis. As the disease progress to advanced HF, patients are faced with many challenges, such as poor quality of life due to worsening symptoms and frequent hospitalizations. Heart failure management adds significant financial burden to the health care system. Palliative care can be integrated into HF care to improve quality of life and symptom management and to address physical, spiritual, and psychosocial needs of patients and families. Palliative care can be used concurrently with or independent of curative or life-prolonging HF therapies. Transformational leadership principles were used to guide the development of a plan to enhance integration of palliative care within traditional advanced HF care.\nDocument [17]: Title: Continuous Cardiac Inotropes in Patients With End-Stage Heart Failure: An Evolving Experience. Abstract: Heart failure (HF) experts recommend initiation of continuous inotrope therapy, such as milrinone or dobutamine, for clinically decompensating patients with stage D HF. Although originally intended to serve solely as a bridge to more definitive surgical therapies, more and more patients are receiving inotrope therapy for purely palliative purposes. In these cases, questions arise regarding care at the end of life. What criteria determine ongoing clinical benefit? Should the inotrope be continued until death? Should inotrope dosing be increased within recommended guidelines to improve symptoms? What is the role of inotropes in hospice care? Here, we describe such a case as a springboard to contemplate the evolving role of inotrope therapies and how hospice and palliative providers may interface with this rapidly developing face of advanced HF care.\nDocument [18]: Title: End-Of-Life Care for Patients With End-Stage Heart Failure, Comparisons of International Guidelines. Abstract: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic, debilitating condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic burden. Patients with end-stage HF (ESHF) who are not a candidate for advanced therapies will continue to progress despite standard medical therapy. Thus, the focus of care shifts from prolonging life to controlling symptoms and improving quality of life through palliative care (<i>PC</i>). Because the condition and prognosis of HF patients evolve and can rapidly deteriorate, it is imperative to begin the discussion on end-of-life (EOL) issues early during HF management. These include the completion of an advance directive, do-not-resuscitate orders, and policies on device therapy and discontinuation as part of advance care planning (ACP). ESHF patients who do not have indications for advanced therapies or those who wish not to have a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplant (HT) often experience high symptom burden despite adequate medical management. The proper identification and assessment of symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, nausea, depression, and anxiety are essential to the management of ESHF and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Psychological support and spiritual care are also crucial to improving the quality of life during EOL. Caregivers of ESHF patients must also be provided supportive care to prevent compassion fatigue and improve resilience in patient care. In this narrative review, we compare the international guidelines and provide an overview of end-of-life and palliative care for patients with ESHF.\nDocument [19]: Title: [Selection criteria to palliative care implementation in advanced heart failure]. Abstract: Early palliative care (PC) integration in advanced and end-stage heart failure has shown to improve quality of life and spiritual well-being and to reduce physical symptoms. Barriers to implementation exist: perception that PC is opposite to \"life-prolonging\" therapies or is involved only in cancer disease and in end of life, prognostic difficulties in advanced heart failure, comorbidities, discrepancy between patient-reported symptom burden and objective measures of disease severity. This is why it is necessary to focus on patient and caregivers \"needs\" instead of exclusively numerical-objective measures, in order to emphasize clinical but also psychological, assistential and spiritual elements contributing to quality of life. The most appropriate instruments are \"patient-reported outcome measures\" (PROMs) or, better, \"patient-centered outcome measures\" (PCOMs), such as the Needs Assessment Tool: Progressive Disease-Heart Failure (NAT: PD-HF), Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS), NECPAL and Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT). Finally, it is important to recognize triggers to initiate a PC approach (important changes in disease trajectory, difficult or refractory symptoms, frequent defibrillator shocks or transplant/mechanical support prevision, functional capacity decline, severe comorbidities, communication needs also for advanced care planning).\nDocument [20]: Title: On-going palliative care enhances perceived control and patient activation and reduces symptom distress in patients with symptomatic heart failure: a pilot study. Abstract: There is a paucity of research about the impact of palliative care (PC) on perceived control (i.e. one's perceived influence over outcomes or events in the environment) and activation (i.e. ability to self-manage) in patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF). Likewise, little is known about the association between perceived control, activation, and symptom distress in this patient population. We hypothesized that patients with advanced HF who received ongoing PC services (i.e. \u22652 PC consultations) vs no access or a single PC consultation would have greater improvements in perceived control and activation and greater reductions in symptom distress three months post-discharge for HF exacerbation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Pheochromocytomas are rare adrenal neoplasms characterized by excess secretion of catecholamines. We describe the case of a 65-year-old man, known for hypertension, with no family history of hereditary pheochromocytoma syndromes. He reported a two-year history of flushing, systolic blood pressure surges to 200 mmHg, headaches, tremors, and syncope. His initial workup revealed elevated 24h urine catecholamines and metanephrines. An adrenal MRI in March 2017 showed a large 7.6 cm heterogeneous right adrenal lesion. Given orthostatic hypotension, his final preoperative dose was limited to a low dose of terazosin and metoprolol. In the operating room, shortly after intubation and Foley insertion, his blood pressure rose to 350 mmHg. Surgery was cancelled and he was admitted to the intensive care unit, where intravenous phentolamine, nitroprusside, and nicardipine were started. His systolic blood pressure would oscillate between 60 mmHg and 350 mmHg at 2-3 minutes' intervals. After 3 days, he was weaned off intravenous medications. His oral medications were uptitrated to high doses of phenoxybenzamine, metoprolol, and nifedipine. Three weeks later, he underwent successful open right adrenalectomy. This case outlines the importance of preoperative preparation of pheochromocytomas and raises the question if phenoxybenzamine is the alpha-blocker of choice for larger tumours with significant hormonal secretion.\nDocument [2]: Title: Resistant hypertension during antituberculosis treatment: how is rifampicin implicated? Abstract: A 67-year-old mental institute resident was treated for smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. His background history included chronic essential hypertension which was well-controlled with amlodipine 10mg daily. However, his blood pressure became suboptimal one week into antitubercular treatment, necessitating escalation of antihypertensive therapy up to six medications. Following completion of antitubercular treatment, his blood pressure improved markedly. The number of antihypertensives was able to be reduced to only two after a month. We postulate that rifampicin has attenuated the therapeutic effect of amlodipine via potent induction of hepatic CYP3A4 but the failure to control the blood pressure even with medications unrelated to cytochrome P450 pathways raises the spectre of an additional interaction.\nDocument [3]: Title: Hypertension in the kidney transplant recipient. Abstract: Elevated arterial blood pressure is common after kidney transplantation and contributes to shortened patient and allograft survivals and increased fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Unfortunately, current evidence indicates that arterial blood pressure remains poorly controlled in kidney transplant recipients. One concern is how best to evaluate treated levels of arterial pressure in transplant recipients as office and clinic measurements often differ from blood pressure readings obtained using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Some antihypertensive drugs interact with immunosuppressive medications and adversely affect electrolyte balance and kidney function, which complicates the management of kidney transplant patients. Target blood pressure readings have been suggested by different guidelines, but patient-specific management plan is still lacking. Understanding the basic mechanisms responsible for the persistent hypertension after kidney transplantation is helpful in drafting patient-directed management plan that includes both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to achieve target blood pressure control. In this review, we propose a multilayered treatment plan that addresses hypertension in both the early and late posttransplant periods, bearing in mind complications of antihypertensive medications, interactions with immunosuppressive drugs, patient comorbidities, and patient-specific cardiovascular risk factors in the posttransplant period.\nDocument [4]: Title: David Ayman, MD: an early investigator of clinical hypertension. Abstract: Dr. David Ayman (1901-1986) was an astute clinician and observer who challenged medical dogma by performing placebo-controlled studies and by meticulous measurement of blood pressure under standardized conditions. He demonstrated that almost all drugs reported to have an antihypertensive effect in the early 20th century had achieved nothing more than placebo response. He noted the marked variability of blood pressure and devised methods to reduce that variability. These observations led to his publications concerning what is now known as \"white coat\" or office hypertension. He determined blood pressure personally in 1524 members of 277 families over three generations and made observations on the hereditary nature of hypertension that countered the single-gene thinking of the day. His work is proof that clinical inquisitiveness, hard work, and the courage to challenge conventional wisdom can result in significant contributions to medicine and science.\nDocument [5]: Title: Novel stratified medicines approach to manage uncontrolled hypertension due to multiple drug intolerances. Abstract: A 61-year-old man with a 30-year history of uncontrolled hypertension was unable to tolerate conventional antihypertensive medications from all classes. At the time of referral to our centre he had discontinued all antihypertensive drugs and felt well. However, his average home blood pressure (HBP) reading was 179/125 mm Hg and echocardiography demonstrated moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. A novel stratified medicines algorithm was used to guide treatment entailing transdermal clonidine patch therapy instead of tablet formulations. Sixteen months later, his average HBP was 147/106 mm Hg with no side effects and the left ventricular hypertrophy had completely regressed. Our experience has taught us that multiple drug intolerance is a common, often overlooked, cause of non-adherence to antihypertensive medication. This case demonstrates the benefit of a novel approach to optimise blood pressure control and emphasises the important role of hypertension specialists in managing complex, high-risk patients unable to tolerate guideline-based therapy.\nDocument [6]: Title: Hypertensive emergency occurred due to forgetting to take antihypertensive medication: A case study. Abstract: A life-threatening condition known as a \"hypertensive emergency\" is marked by a severe increase in blood pressure together with acute or significant target-organ damage. On 1 June 2022, a 67-year-old black male farmer was admitted to the emergency department with a major chief complaint of breathing difficulty. The patient was traveling to the village for work and forgetting his medication at home, and he was losing consciousness and motor activity at his workplace. He presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, confusion, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and faintness. An abnormal cardiac region was visible on chest X-rays, and there were no changes to the pulmonary parenchyma or fluid overload. Upon admission, hydralazine (5 mg) intravenously was administered immediately, and he was reassessed after 20 min and kept at the emergency department. The next day, sustained-release nifedipine (20 mg) was initiated orally twice a day for the patient, and he was transferred to the medical ward. In the medical ward, the patient was assessed for 4 days, and in those 4 days, he showed marked improvement. Hypertensive emergency treatment intends to reverse target-organ damage, readily lowering blood pressure, decreasing adverse clinical complications, and enhancing the quality of life.\nDocument [7]: Title: May Measurement Month 2019: The Global Blood Pressure Screening Campaign of the International Society of Hypertension. Abstract: Elevated blood pressure remains the single biggest risk factor contributing to the global burden of disease and mortality. May Measurement Month is an annual global screening campaign aiming to improve awareness of blood pressure at the individual and population level. Adults (\u226518 years) recruited through opportunistic sampling were screened at sites in 92 countries during May 2019. Ideally, 3 blood pressure readings were measured for each participant, and data on lifestyle factors and comorbidities were collected. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg, or a diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg (mean of the second and third readings) or taking antihypertensive medication. When necessary, multiple imputation was used to estimate participants' mean blood pressure. Mixed-effects models were used to evaluate associations between blood pressure and participant characteristics. Of 1 508 130 screenees 482 273 (32.0%) had never had a blood pressure measurement before and 513 337 (34.0%) had hypertension, of whom 58.7% were aware, and 54.7% were on antihypertensive medication. Of those on medication, 57.8% were controlled to <140/90 mm Hg, and 28.9% to <130/80 mm Hg. Of all those with hypertension, 31.7% were controlled to <140/90 mm Hg, and 350 825 (23.3%) participants had untreated or inadequately treated hypertension. Of those taking antihypertensive medication, half were taking only a single drug, and 25% reported using aspirin inappropriately. This survey is the largest ever synchronized and standardized contemporary compilation of global blood pressure data. This campaign is needed as a temporary substitute for systematic blood pressure screening in many countries worldwide.\nDocument [8]: Title: What Should Be the Target Blood Pressure for This Older Patient With Hypertension?: Grand Rounds Discussion From Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Abstract: Hypertension is prevalent and the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Controversy exists regarding the optimum threshold above which to begin antihypertensive therapy and the optimum target blood pressure once medication is begun. This controversy is particularly true for older patients, who may be more likely to benefit from treatment because of their higher risk for cardiovascular events, but may also be more at risk for adverse effects of treatment. Two guidelines published in 2017 address this issue. The American College of Physicians/American Academy of Family Physicians guideline recommends initiating antihypertensive therapy for older patients (aged 60 years or older) if systolic blood pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher and to treat to the same target. They recommend a lower threshold for starting treatment and a lower target systolic blood pressure (140 mm Hg) for patients with cerebrovascular disease and potentially those at high risk for cardiovascular events. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline, which is based primarily on SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), advises a target systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg for community-dwelling ambulatory patients aged 65 years or older. This article presents the case of a 79-year-old man who is contemplating antihypertensive therapy. Two experts discuss the optimal approach for the patient and suggest how to apply the 2 guidelines to his care.\nDocument [9]: Title: A First Report of HCTZ and Dicyclomine Induced Uncharacteristic Contraction Alkalosis. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Contraction alkalosis is characterized by low serum sodium and chloride and high serum carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels. <b>Case Report:</b> A 28-year-old Caucasian active-duty male with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (D-IBS) presented to his primary care provider (PCP) with elevated blood pressure (136/96&#160;mmHg), was diagnosed with stage-2 hypertension, and started oral HCTZ (25&#160;mg/day). His medications included dicyclomine (10&#160;mg oral three times daily). Subsequently, (Visit 1), his blood pressure was 130/91&#160;mmHg and he was started on telmisartan (20&#160;mg/day). At Visit 2, 4 weeks later, his blood pressure improved (121/73&#160;mmHg); however, blood chemistry revealed elevated serum CO2 (32&#160;mEq/L) and chloride (94&#160;mmol/L). Four days later, the patient presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnea and swallowing difficulty. The patient returned to his PCP 3&#160;days later complaining of cough, congestion, vomiting, and mild dyspnea, blood pressure of 124/84&#160;mmHg. Two months later, sudden onset of projectile vomiting and abdominal pain while running was reported, resolved by rehydration and a single oral dose of prochlorperazine 25&#160;mg. Three months later, (Visit 3), he complained of lightheadedness and cloudy judgment, suggesting contraction alkalosis. HCTZ was discontinued and telmisartan was increased to 20&#160;mg twice daily. A follow-up blood chemistry panel 2&#160;weeks later revealed serum chloride and CO2 levels within normal limits and blood pressure under 130/80&#160;mmHg. <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first known report of contraction alkalosis driven by drug-drug interaction between dicyclomine and HCTZ.\nDocument [10]: Title: Acute Cerebellitis and Atypical Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Associated with Methadone Intoxication. Abstract: We report a case of a 9-year-old boy who presented with altered mental status and ataxia following 3 days of vomiting. Shortly after arrival to our emergency department, he declined and required intubation. The following day, he recovered and was successfully extubated. He was found to be positive for methadone on his urine drug screen. Brain imaging demonstrated a pattern of acute cerebellitis. Following extubation, the patient returned to his normal mental status; however, he began to have consistently elevated blood pressure and bradycardia and subsequent brain imaging showed supratentorial changes that were related to atypical posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Through medical management including high-dose steroids and antihypertensive medications, the patient's blood pressure normalized, and he was eventually discharged home without further complications.\nDocument [11]: Title: Blood pressure and risk of renal cell carcinoma in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition. Abstract: Elevated blood pressure has been implicated as a risk factor for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but prospective studies were confined to men and did not consider the effect of antihypertensive medication. The authors examined the relation among blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, and RCC in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Blood pressure was measured in 296,638 women and men, recruited in eight European countries during 1992-1998, 254,935 of whom provided information on antihypertensive medication. During a mean follow-up of 6.2 years, 250 cases of RCC were identified. Blood pressure was independently associated with risk of RCC. The relative risks for the highest versus the lowest category of systolic (>/=160 mmHg vs. <120 mmHg) and diastolic (>/=100 mmHg vs. <80 mmHg) blood pressures were 2.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.53, 4.02) and 2.34 (95% confidence interval: 1.54, 3.55). Risk estimates did not significantly differ according to sex or use of antihypertensive medication. Individuals taking antihypertensive drugs were not at a significantly increased risk unless blood pressure was poorly controlled. These results support the hypothesis that hypertension, rather than its medications, increases the risk of RCC in both sexes, while effective blood pressure control may lower the risk.\nDocument [12]: Title: En bloc resection of a pheochromocytoma metastatic to the spine for local tumor control and for treatment of chronic catecholamine release and related hypertension. Abstract: Resection of metastatic pheochromocytomas may be complicated by transient postoperative neurological deficits due to hypotension. The authors report the first case of en bloc excision of a spinal pheochromocytoma with associated long-term hypertensive management off all medication. Interestingly, this is the first case of transient hypotension following en bloc resection of pheochromocytoma associated with temporary hypotension-associated neurological decline that resolved completely after correction of hypotension postoperatively. A 23-year-old man with a prior adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma presented with focal thoracic pain. He had a known T-10 vertebral body lesion for which he received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Imaging demonstrated increased destruction of the T-10 vertebral body, which was concerning for tumor growth. The patient underwent angiographic embolization followed by single-stage posterior en bloc vertebrectomy with placement of a cage and posterior instrumentation and fusion without event. However, approximately 24 hours after surgery, the patient's systolic blood pressure was consistently no higher than 70 mm Hg. During this time, he began suffering from severe bilateral lower-extremity weakness. His systolic blood pressure increased with dopamine, and his strength immediately improved. The patient's oral regimen of adrenergic blockade was stopped, and he recovered without event. Since that time, the patient has been symptom free and requires no antihypertensive medication. The role of en bloc resection for metastatic lesions of the spine is controversial but may be warranted in cases of metastatic pheochromocytoma. En bloc resection avoids intralesional tumor resection and thus may help prevent complications of hypertensive crisis associated with hormonal secretion and extensive blood loss, which are not uncommon with pheochromocytoma resection surgeries. Additionally, the role of en bloc spondylectomy in this setting may allow for metabolic treatment as patients with actively secreting tumors may no longer require antiadrenergic medications.\nDocument [13]: Title: [Self monitoring of blood pressure in Guadeloupe in 2005 results of the PRETRAHGUAD enquiry]. Abstract: The object of this enquiry was to estimate the number of self monitoring devices for blood pressure measurement in Guadeloupe in 2005 and to determine how they were used. The enquiry included 509 patients aged over 35 years and living in Guadeloupe meeting the inclusion criteria of PRETRAHGUAD: PREvalence et TRAitement de Hypertension en GUADeloupe. The enquiry was made by Qualistat, a survey institute. Designed as a survey, it was based on the two degree quota method. It was carried out by telephone by CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Inquiry) networked computer programming by ten operators trained by experts of the HTA-GWAD organisation. In addition to questions on socio-demographic background and biometric parameters, the operators also asked about observance of antihypertensive treatment, the ownership of a self monitoring blood pressure device and its usage. A subject who said he took a treatment validated as antihypertensive was considered to be a \"treated hypertensive\". The results indicate that in 2005, in Guadeloupe, 32% of the population over 35 years of age were treated hypertensives, making a total of 51,230 individuals. Forty three percent of treated hypertensives and 19% of other subjects admitted to having used a self monitoring blood pressure device. Twenty six percent of the study population owned a device. Of the estimated total of 43,220 devices in circulation, nearly half of them were wrist devices. Regular usage (at least once per month) was declared by 73% of hypertensive and 46% of other subjects. Out of the total population, the medical practitioner had spoken of self monitoring of blood pressure to his patients and had incited only 18% to carry it out. The authors conclude that, in 2005, one third of adults over 35 years of age were treated for hypertension and 43% of treated hypertensives owned a self monitoring blood pressure device. The incitation by medical practitioners to use this method of self monitoring remained modest. This technique would seem to be little used by medical practitioners although the patients have started to equip themselves with the device.\nDocument [14]: Title: Complete remission of hypertension in a hemodialysis patient after adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism and renal transplantation. Abstract: A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for the hormonal evaluation of a right adrenal adenoma. He had been diagnosed with severe proteinuria and hypertension, and antihypertensive treatment was started at the age of 60. His renal function gradually declined, and hemodialysis was begun at the age of 64. Since his blood pressure was uncontrollable and resistant to antihypertensive treatment, an endocrinological examination was performed for an incidental right adrenal mass detected by computed tomography. The results of screening, including captopril challenge and an adrenocorticotropin stimulation test for primary aldosteronism, and adrenal venous sampling suggested excessive aldosterone secretion from the right adrenal gland. Adrenalectomy was performed; his blood pressure decreased and became well-controlled with a reduced antihypertensive regimen. Furthermore, he received renal transplantation which resulted in normalization of his serum potassium level, improvement of renal function and hormonal levels such as plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, and satisfactory blood pressure without any antihypertensive medications. This case is extremely important to demonstrate the effects of adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism in a hemodialysis patient. It is possible that adrenalectomy may be a useful treatment for primary aldosteronism even in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Careful long-term follow-up of our case and investigations of the efficacy of adrenalectomy in similar cases are needed to address this issue.\nDocument [15]: Title: Taste disturbances related to medication use. Abstract: The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented to a weekly pharmacy-run blood pressure (BP) screening at the retirement community where he resides. His past medical history consists of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and altitude sickness. The patient's BP was 122/48 mmHg, which was lower than his average (148/64 mmHg). The patient was asked a series of questions to determine the cause of the BP decline. He commented that he does not drink much water, stating, \"It tastes bad.\" The patient started acetazolamide six years ago for treatment of altitude sickness and it was suspected that this was contributing to the patient's taste disturbance. The pharmacist apprised the physician that the patient was experiencing a probable adverse effect from a medication and then developed a program to taper the medication based on the pharmacokinetics of the drug. After the drug was completely tapered off, the patient reported that not only had his sense of taste returned to normal, but his cognition had improved as well. He previously could not perform some of his instrumental activities of daily living without help, but now believes he can continue to live independently. He reported no dizzy spells since discontinuing the medication and his BP has remained stable.\nDocument [16]: Title: [Uncontrolled factors of blood pressure in essential hypertension: from \"patient's high blood pressure\" to \"hypertensive patient\"]. Abstract: Hypertension is a significant medical and public health issue which puts an enormous burden on health care resources and the community. It is a chronic medical condition in which the systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) is elevated. Serious complications including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases would be preventable if the rise in BP with age could be prevented or diminished. The majority of hypertensive patients require long-term treatment. Oral antihypertensive drugs, lifestyle modification including exercise and dietary modification are milestones for hypertension therapy. However, the control rate of hypertension hasn't reached the expected requirements currently. \"Three lows\" status quo, just low awareness, low treatment, and low control, are still the major problems confronting modern medicine. Recently, uncontrolled factors of blood pressure are widely concerned, which include insomnia, constipation, mood disorders, exogenous, etc. What's more, the control strategies of hypertension should not only pay close attention to \"patient's high blood pressure\", but also to \"hypertensive patient\". Therefore, the treatment of uncontrolled factors of blood pressure plays an important role in hypertensive therapy, which could be further research priorities.\nDocument [17]: Title: Management of hypertension in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. Abstract: The optimal management of blood pressure in the first 24 hours of ischemic stroke remains a controversial topic. Most patients are hypertensive at presentation and subsequently experience a spontaneous decline in blood pressure. Decreasing penumbral blood flow and exacerbating vasogenic edema are significant concerns in whether to treat blood pressure elevations. Although an initially elevated blood pressure has been associated with poor outcome, attempts to acutely lower blood pressure are also associated with worsened outcomes. Thus, the current approach in acute ischemic stroke is permissive hypertension, in which antihypertensive treatment is warranted in patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 220 mm Hg, receiving thrombolytic therapy, or with concomitant medical issues. The use of predictable and titratable medications that judiciously reduce (approximately 10% to 15%) the initial presenting mean arterial pressure is recommended in these situations. Future study must define optimal blood pressure goals, likely on an individual basis.\nDocument [18]: Title: Non-enteral therapy for hypertension in the inpatient setting. Abstract: Chronic hypertension requiring treatment with regularly administered oral medications is the most common cardiovascular disease among adults. When patients with hypertension suffer an illness which requires hospitalization and precludes normal oral drug intake, blood pressure may rise sufficiently to require alternative treatments. Consequences of the acute illnesses themselves and their treatments may also elevate blood pressure and further complicate antihypertensive management. The optimal medical regimen to control blood pressure under these circumstances depends upon a number of variables, including co-morbid conditions, concurrently administered drugs, and the overall clinical stability of the patient. This paper reviews issues related to hypertension in the hospitalized patient unable to take oral medications and summarizes antihypertensive treatment options based on clinical and pharmacological considerations.\nDocument [19]: Title: Assessment of drug compliance in patients with high blood pressure resistant to antihypertensive therapy. Abstract: The persistence of high blood pressure under antihypertensive treatment (resistant hypertension) entails an increased cardiovascular risk. It occurs in three of ten treated hypertensive patients, and has several possible contributing factors, notably insufficient therapeutic adherence. There are a number of ways to evaluate whether patients take their medication as prescribed. These include interviewing the patient, pill counting, prescription follow-up, assay of drugs in blood or urine, and use of electronic pill dispensers. None is perfect. However, the essential is to discuss with the patient the importance of complying with the treatment as soon as it is prescribed for the first time, and not waiting for the appearance of resistant hypertension. The measurement of blood pressure outside the medical office and the monitoring of adherence may help to identify patients in whom hypertension is truly resistant and so to tailor the measures required to improve the control of blood pressure in the most appropriate manner.\nDocument [20]: Title: A case with primary hyperaldosteronism associated with chronic kidney disease. Abstract: Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension. PA may be associated with a decline in renal function. About 20% of cases with resistant HTN eventually cause PA, so all these patients should be evaluated for PA. Herein, we present a case with drug-resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD), the cause of which was PA. Despite his low-salt diet modifications and treatment with several classes of antihypertensive medication, he had poorly controlled blood pressure (BP). Measurements of aldosterone and renin raised the concern of PA. Imaging confirmed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Due to the persistently high BP, despite the modification of the antihypertensive treatment, the patient underwent unilateral adrenalectomy, as the only feasible possibility of lowering aldosterone levels. After surgery, the patient had an improvement in both BP values and renal function. PA is difficult to diagnose in patients with CKD and Arterial Hypertension because hypertension is often associated with CKD, but PA accounts for a significant percentage of drug-resistant hypertension, so these patients should be screened for secondary arterial hypertension.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Although lupus induced by penicillamine, the first-line medication for Wilson's disease, is well-documented, primary systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) co-occurring with Wilson's disease has only rarely been reported. Symptom overlap can add to difficulties in making the correct and complete diagnosis of these two systemic diseases. An 18-year-old female was diagnosed with simultaneous Wilson's disease and SLE and was successfully treated with hydroxychloroquine and oral zinc. We also reviewed the literature for cases of Wilson's disease co-occurring with SLE not induced by penicillamine and found six other cases. Clinical presentations, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed and summarized to expand our understanding of this rare condition. The most frequent diagnostic clues to Wilson's disease in patients with SLE included unexplained liver damage despite well-controlled SLE, extrapyramidal symptoms and signs, hyper-intense signals of the basal ganglia bilaterally on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI images, and Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings on physical examination. Penicillamine should be avoided or used cautiously in Wilson's disease patients complicated by SLE. The overall prognosis is good if treated in a timely manner. Key Points \u2022 SLE complicated by Wilson's disease or the co-occurrence of the two conditions in the absence of penicillamine may exist in rare conditions. \u2022 The diagnostic clues for identifying Wilson's disease in SLE patients may include unexplained liver damage despite well-controlled SLE, extrapyramidal symptoms and signs, and K-F rings found by physical examination. \u2022 Penicillamine should be avoided or used cautiously in Wilson's patients with SLE.\nDocument [2]: Title: [Wilson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Co-occurrence]. Abstract: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper transport leading to hepatic but also to highly variable neurological symptoms with basal ganglia and cerebellar manifestation. Symptoms, signs and results of investigations can overlap with those of other central nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis and sometimes delay diagnosis.We report on a 38-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with a hepatic form of Wilson's disease at age 12 and with multiple sclerosis at age 38. Intravenous radio copper test confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Multiple sclerosis was diagnosed after occurrence of transient sensory disturbances in both legs, based on typical changes on MRI over the course of 2 years, in the cerebrospinal fluid and in multimodal evoked potentials.Although Wilson's disease and multiple sclerosis are known as distinct diseases with a completely different pathophysiology, symptoms and results of evoked potentials overlap, and they share a common historic background. Similarities and differences of both disorders are discussed.\nDocument [3]: Title: Wilson's Disease Manifestation in Late Adulthood: A Case Report and Literature Review. Abstract: Wilson's disease is a rare inherited condition that results in an excessive copper buildup in various organs, especially the liver, brain, and other vital organs, leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, neurological problems like involuntary movements, clumsy gait, speech difficulties, and psychological issues, in addition to other symptoms. It is an ATP7B gene mutation-driven autosomal recessive condition. Although the condition is present from birth, symptoms often start to show up between the ages of five and 35, when the body has accumulated enough copper. Wilson's disease may become fatal if an excessive amount of copper is accumulated in the body. It is treatable and has a good prognosis if diagnosed early. Early identification, however, is not always straightforward since symptoms might resemble those of other diseases and develop later in life when copper is absorbed by food and drink and gradually accumulates in the body's many organs. In addition to medicine, physicians advise people with Wilson's disease to avoid foods and beverages containing copper. Our patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease at the age of 16 and was on Cuprimine which helped her to survive. Her younger sister was diagnosed at an early age and was started on a treatment regimen, which is why her sister's manifestation of Wilson's disease was less severe than hers.\nDocument [4]: Title: Late onset of Wilson's disease in a family with genetic haemochromatosis. Abstract: We report the coexistence of Wilson's disease and genetic haemochromatosis in one family. The diagnosis of genetic haemochromatosis was established in a 52-year-old man. Among his siblings, one 57-year-old sister and one 55-year-old brother had decreased copper and ceruloplasmin levels in serum and increased urinary copper excretion. The sister shared the same human leucocyte antigen haplotypes and was homozygous for the HFE mutation C282Y, like the propositus. However, she had normal liver iron content and increased liver copper content. Her dietary copper intake was probably excessive. The association of Wilson's disease and genetic haemochromatosis is rare and has only been described twice. The onset of Wilson's disease after 50 years of age is rare; Wilson's disease should be considered in any patient with unexplained chronic liver disease; an excess in liver copper content might be induced by excessive dietary input in a susceptible individual.\nDocument [5]: Title: A New Onset of Mania in a 49-Year-Old Man: An Interesting Case of Wilson Disease. Abstract: Wilson disease is a rare copper metabolism disorder that generally occurs in individuals between 5 and 35 years of age. Common clinical manifestations are hepatic, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms. Roughly, 4% of all cases occur in patients over 40 years of age and, among these patients, the presenting symptoms are generally neuropsychiatric, which often leads to misdiagnosis as a primary psychiatric disorder and a delay in correct diagnosis. This report presents the case of a 49-year-old man with no formal psychiatric history who presented with a new onset of mania. We outline the distinctive characteristics that appeared inconsistent with a primary psychiatric disorder and pointed toward secondary mania. Despite low serum ceruloplasmin, the absence of brain abnormalities more typical of Wilson disease on magnetic resonance imaging led a neurology consultant to advise that the diagnosis was likely primarily psychiatric. Due to atypical components of the patient's presentation, such as his late age of onset for bipolar disorder and acute cognitive decline, the psychiatric team advocated for further diagnostic workup. The subsequent evaluation confirmed Wilson disease based on specific ophthalmological and hepatic abnormalities and further copper studies. In addition, once diagnosed, the management of Wilson disease involves distinct clinical considerations given patients' presumed vulnerability to neurological side effects. This case illustrates the role psychiatric providers play in advocating for diagnostic workup in patients with atypical presentations of primary psychiatric disorders and the distinct diagnostic and treatment considerations associated with Wilson disease.\nDocument [6]: Title: Commentary on \"A New Onset of Mania in a 49-Year-Old Man: An Interesting Case of Wilson Disease\".

Abstract: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which copper pathologically accumulates primarily within the liver, brain and other tissues. It can presents clinically as liver disease, as a progressive neurological disorder or as psychiatric illness. The wide array of clinical manifestations of WD can lead to misdiagnosis with subsequent greater risk of irreversible damage to liver and brain. Many tests can be used to investigate patients of Wilson disease, including serum free copper, 24 hours urine copper estimation, hepatic copper estimation and genetic mutation testing. But there is no single ideal diagnostic test that can exclude or confirm the disease with certainty. The aim of the study was to find out the efficacy of different diagnostic test for the diagnosis of Wilson disease. This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2016 through January 2018. A total of 56 cases of Wilson disease and 39 patients with a liver disease other than WD were studied. Wilson disease was diagnosed by Leipzig score. Along with other physical findings and laboratory investigations slit lamp eye examination for KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24 hour urinary copper excretion were done. The mean age of WD patients was 9.69\u00b12.37 years, male female ratio was 1:1. Serum ceruloplasmin level was significantly lower in WD patient (p<0.001). Median of 24 hour urinary copper in WD was 702.75\u03bcg/ 24 hr (range119-11210\u03bcg/24 hour) and in non WD group it was 77.41\u03bcg/24 hour (range 20.0-478\u03bcg/24 hour) and the difference between them is statistically significant (p=0.001). The sensitivity of KF ring was 82.1% and specificity was 100%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin were 98.2%, 92.3%, 94.8%, 97.2% and 95.7% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 24 hour urinary copper were 100%, 63%, 80% and 85.1% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and basal 24 hour urinary copper excretion when combined together came out to be 70.4%, 100%, 100%, 59.3% and 79.3% respectively. This study result showed that serum ceruloplasmin and 24 hour urinary copper can be used as a screening test for the diagnosis of Wilson disease.\nDocument [8]: Title: The acute haemolytic syndrome in Wilson's disease--a review of 22 patients. Abstract: An analysis of 321 case notes of patients with Wilson's disease seen between 1955 and 2000 and one case seen in 1949 has revealed that 22 patients presented with a haemolytic crisis. This study was not a specific research project but a retrospective analysis of 321 patients with Wilson's disease seen between 1949 and 2000. All investigations were carried out in the best interests of diagnosis and management of patients referred to my clinic. The delay in diagnosis in 18 cases resulted in progression to severe hepatic disease in 14 cases and to neurological disease in 4 cases. One patient had no symptoms at the time her sister's illness was diagnosed as Wilson's disease. In a second patient, with liver disease, the diagnosis was also made when a sister was found to have Wilson's disease. There was a female to male ratio of 15:7. The average age of onset was 12.6 years and the incidence 6.9%. Delay in diagnosis resulted in nine deaths. Three patients, late in the series, were admitted in the acute phase, two female and one male; of these two responded to chelation therapy, the third required liver transplantation. Haemolysis appeared to be extravascular, and possible mechanisms of the haemolysis are discussed.\nDocument [9]: Title: Wilson's disease - a tricky diagnosis on the acute take. Abstract: Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism in the body, leading to excess copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and brain. It often presents to both primary and secondary care, with a combination of liver disease and neurological or psychiatric symptoms, but the presentation can be highly variable. Early recognition and treatment of Wilson's disease is important to prevent critical hepatic and neurological complications. In this case report, we describe the presentation of an 18-year-old male university student with a combination of dysphagia, tremors, and slurred speech, which progressed over several months. Through a series of investigations, the patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease and received appropriate treatment. This report highlights the importance of considering Wilson's disease in patients with a wide range of symptoms and the need for a pragmatic approach to diagnosis, including routine and additional testing as necessary.\nDocument [10]: Title: [Wilson-Konovalov disease in 3 sisters: a radical change in prognosis if timely diagnosed]. Abstract: Wilson-Konovalov disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain and other target organs. The paper describes a family case of the abdominal form of the disease in three sisters, the eldest of them died from fulminant liver failure at the age of 18 years. The second sister aged 16 years was diagnosed as having the disease at the stage of decompensated liver cirrhosis; her treatment with D-penicillamine resulted in complete disease remission. The youngest sister was diagnosed with the disease at the preclinical stage, which could expect its good prognosis. However, the patient's refusal of treatment led to death from liver failure. This case demonstrates the importance of timely diagnosis and the possibility of dramatic improvement in prognosis even at the stage of decompensated liver cirrhosis.\nDocument [11]: Title: [The onset of psychiatric disorders and Wilson's disease]. Abstract: Wilson's disease is an infrequent, autosomic recessive pathology, resulting from a loss of function of an adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B or WDNP), secondarily to a change (more than 60 are described currently), insertion or deletion of the ATP7B gene located on the chromosome 13q14.3-q21.1, which involves a reduction or an absence of the transport of copper in the bile and its accumulation in the body, notably the brain. Wilson's disease is transmitted by an autosomic recessive gene located on the long arm of chromosome 13. The prevalence of the heterozygote is evaluated at 1/90 and the homozygote at 1/30,000. Consanguinity, frequent in the socially geographically isolated populations, increases the prevalence of the disease. The toxic quantities of copper, which accumulate in the liver since early childhood and perhaps before, remain concentrated in the body for years. Hence, cytological and histological modifications can be detected in the biopsies, before the appearance of clinical or biological symptoms of hepatic damage. The accumulation of copper in the liver is due to a defect in the biliary excretion of metal and is accompanied invariably by a deficit in ceruloplasmin; protein synthesized from a transferred ATP7B gene, which causes retention of the copper ions in the liver. The detectable cellular anomalies are of two types: hepatic lesions resulting in acute hepatic insufficiency, acute hepatitis and finally advanced cirrhosis and lesions of the central nervous system responsible for the neurological and psychiatric disorders. In approximately 40-50% of the patients, the first manifestation of Wilson's disease affects the central nervous system. Although copper diffuses in the liver towards the blood and then towards other tissues, it has disastrous consequences only in the brain. It can therefore cause either a progressive neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders. Wilson's disease begins in the form of a hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disease in at least 90% of the patients. In some rare cases, the first manifestations of the disease can be psychiatric which, according to the literature, accounts for only 10% of the cases. The disease can be revealed by isolated behavioral problems, an irrational syndrome, a schizophrenic syndrome, or a manic-depressive syndrome. Damage to the central nervous system can be more severe, thus, several differential diagnoses have been discussed: a psychotic disorder of late appearance; a depressive state; a mental confusion disorder. The clinical syndrome is complex. Indeed, it is the polymorphism, which dominates in the description of the psychiatric demonstrations of the disease. This can lead to prejudicial diagnostic wandering, particularly since heavy sedative treatment may be required to suppress behavioral problems. Clinically, Wilson's disease generally appears between the age of 10 and 20. It rarely remains masked until after the age of 40. The first manifestations are hepatic (40% of the cases), neurological (35%) or psychiatric (10%). The inaugural disorder can finally take on a haematological, renal, or mixed form in approximately 15% of the cases. We have detailed the principal clinical elements. In approximately 40-50% of the patients, the first manifestation of the disease affects the central nervous system, where\nDocument [12]: Title: Neurological Wilson's Disease Signs-Hepatic Encephalopathy or Copper Toxicosis? Abstract: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive (AR) disorder resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for the encryption of transmembrane copper transporting ATPase. The symptomatic presentation of the disease is estimated to be about 1 in 30,000. The impairment of ATP7B function results in a copper overload in hepatocytes, which further leads to liver pathology. This copper overload also occurs in other organs, most particularly in the brain. This could then cause the occurrence of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Symptoms differ substantially and most often occur between the ages of 5 and 35 years. Early symptoms are commonly hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric. While disease presentation is most often asymptomatic, it could also range as far as to include fulminant hepatic failure, ataxia, and cognitive disorders. Various treatments are available for Wilson's disease, including chelation therapy and zinc salts, which can reverse copper overload through different mechanisms. In select cases, liver transplantation is recommended. New medications, such as tetrathiomolybdate salts, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, prognosis is favorable; however, diagnosing patients before the onset of severe symptoms is a significant concern. Early screening for WD could help in diagnosing patients earlier and improving treatment outcomes.\nDocument [13]: Title: [Diagnosis of Kayser Fleischer Ring: Can Early Diagnosis Improve the Outcome of Wilson's Disease?] Abstract: Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disease of copper metabolism that leads to increased accumulation of copper in the body. Deposits are found mainly in the liver, brain and eye. If left untreated, the disease can lead to movement disorders, personality changes, liver failure and even death. There are many possible differential diagnoses. Diagnosis can only be made through specific test procedures. The ophthalmologist therefore has a special role in the early detection of a Wilson's disease. In our clinic, a 19-year old female patient presented with a faint Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring with otherwise normal ophthalmological findings. The patient had progressive liver failure and received a liver transplant two months after first presentation in the eye clinic. An early ophthalmological co-evaluation with a thorough examination is of great importance for rapid diagnosis. The copper deposits are found in the Descemet membrane and begin in the Schwalbe's line. The so-called Kayser-Fleischer ring can be seen on the Descemet membrane up to 5 mm away from the limbus. Other possible ophthalmological manifestations are chalcosis of the entire Descemet, icterus of the sclera or a sunflower cataract. In the absence of copper deposits in the slit lamp examination, gonioscopy should always be performed if Wilson's disease is suspected. Early diagnosis can protect patients from unnecessary complications and operations. Wilson's disease has a good prognosis if treated.\nDocument [14]: Title: Two unusual cases with Wilson's disease: hepatoma and fulminant hepatitis treated with plasma exchange. Abstract: We report two atypical cases of Wilson's disease. The first case is a 22-year-old male patient with a history of disease for 15 years and diagnosed as Wilson's disease upon investigations. Alpha-fetoprotein level was found elevated and computed tomography showed a 3.5-cm liver mass. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed. Radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation were performed successfully. The second case is a 24-year-old female patient who presented with fulminant hepatitis. Urinary copper excretion and ceruloplasmin levels were suggestive of Wilson's disease. Despite chelation therapy, no improvement was observed. Plasma exchange therapy was performed for seven days. Her clinical status improved, and transplantation was no longer needed. To conclude, although hepatoma is rarely seen in Wilson's disease, patients should be examined regularly to diagnose it in a treatable stage. Removal of copper and toxic metabolites with plasma exchange therapy may be a way of treatment for fulminant hepatitis associated with Wilson's disease.\nDocument [15]: Title: D-Penicillamine improved laparoscopic and histological findings of the liver in a patient with Wilson's disease: 3-year follow-up after diagnosis of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia of Wilson's disease. Abstract: We report a 13-year-old girl who presented with hepatic failure and hemolytic anemia. Laboratory findings showed a normal serum copper level (104 microg/dl), high urinary copper level (2370 microg/dl), and low serum ceruloplasmin level (14.3 microg/dl). Slit-lamp examination revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings on her cornea, and she was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration relieved the serious condition, after that laparoscopic examination was performed. Administration of D-penicillamine and restriction of dietary copper (<1 mg/day) were started, leading to a normalized serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) level. After 3 years, she again underwent laparoscopic examination, and the laparoscopic and histological findings of her liver were obviously improved. Management of the copper level can reverse severe liver fibrosis in Wilson's disease.\nDocument [16]: Title: Late-onset Wilson Disease in a Patient Followed-up for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. Abstract: A 73-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for persistent liver dysfunction. When the patient was 45 years old, her youngest sister had been diagnosed with Wilson disease (WD). The patient therefore underwent several family screening tests, all of which were unremarkable. She had an annual medical checkup and was diagnosed with liver dysfunction and fatty liver at 68 years old. A liver biopsy and genetic testing were performed, and she was diagnosed with WD; chelation therapy was then initiated. In patients with hepatic disorders and a family history of WD, multiple medical examinations should be conducted, as the development of WD is possible regardless of age.\nDocument [17]: Title: Difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of Wilson disease-a case series of five patients. Abstract: Wilson disease (WD) may present symptomatically at any age. There is great variability in the neurological symptoms present, in the clinical state of WD patients, and in the response to decoppering therapy. Early diagnosis and compliance with anti-copper therapy are essential. Here we present five different WD cases to illustrate different problems encountered during diagnosis and treatment. The first case demonstrates that decoppering therapy may be very effective even with severe neurological symptoms. In addition, we see the importance of family screening, especially among the proband's siblings. Case 2 shows that we must be very careful during diagnosis. In the reported family, WD was diagnosed in the father of the proband although her brother had liver pathology but not caused by WD. Other cases teach us that decoppering therapy with d-penicillamine must be introduced slowly because of the high risk of neurological deterioration, especially in patients with typical WD brain changes even without neurological signs. We also have to consider concomitant therapies in WD patients. Neuroleptics may cause exacerbation and should be used at a low dose and for the shortest period possible. A full consideration for the issues surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of WD can lead to optimised care with reduced risk of progression and disability.\nDocument [18]: Title: Wilson's disease: a patient undiagnosed for 18 years. Abstract: Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, is the most common inherited hepatic disease in Hong Kong. Diagnosis is based on the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurological symptoms, and/or a low serum ceruloplasmin concentration (<0.20 g/L). Early detection and treatment protect patients and their presymptomatic siblings from devastating organ damage. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease may nonetheless be overlooked if only established clinical and laboratory tests are used as diagnostic criteria. We report diagnosis of the disorder using genetic analysis of ATP7B in a presymptomatic sibling who escaped diagnosis during family screening 18 years previously. The patient was 11 months old when family screening was performed following diagnosis of Wilson's disease in an elder sister. The boy was considered to be unaffected on the basis of laboratory results in the expected range: serum copper level, 4.6 micromol/L; serum ceruloplasmin level, 0.16 g/L; and 24-hour urinary copper excretion, 0.14 micromol/day. Molecular analysis of ATP7B was performed; it revealed that the two siblings shared the same compound heterozygous mutations (G943D and 2299delC). We recommend that molecular diagnosis is the only definitive means of diagnosing Wilson's disease in children younger than 1 year.\nDocument [19]: Title: Late onset Wilson's disease: therapeutic implications. Abstract: The clinical symptoms of Wilson's disease (WD) usually develop between 3 and 40 years of age and include signs of liver and/or neurologic and psychiatric disease. We report on an 84-year-old woman with WD. Despite the absence of treatment, the only symptom she presented with, until the age of 74 years, was Kayser-Fleisher rings. At the age of 74, she developed slightly abnormal liver function. This case raises the following issues: (a) Should WD be considered in all patients of all ages who manifest signs related to the disease? (b) Are ATP7B mutations fully penetrant? (c) Should all patients diagnosed presymptomatically receive anticopper therapy?\nDocument [20]: Title: Wilson's Disease: Diagnosis of Wilson's Disease in Ethiopian Young Sisters. Abstract: Label=\"BACKGROUND\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">Wilson's disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Clinical signs, biochemical parameters, histologic findings, and/or ATP7B genetic testing are required to diagnose Wilson's disease. <i>Case Presentation</i>. 25-year-old and 22-year-old young women (siblings) presented to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, with difficulty of keeping balance of 3-year duration and progressive extremity weakness of 5-year duration, respectively.

Abstract: Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea (TECSA) is observed in some patients when they are treated with positive airway pressure (PAP) after significant resolution of the preexisting obstructive events in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature for studies describing the natural history of TECSA.\nDocument [2]: Title: A Sleep Apnea Therapy Device Uses No Added Pressure. Abstract: Sleep Apnea is a common sleeping disorder that affects over 25 million Americans. Due to the complex nature of sleep apnea, and the human body, neither an effective nor comfortable treatment option for sleep apnea has been developed. Accordingly, we describe a novel alternative to current sleep apnea therapies, including CPAP therapy. A comfortable device for treating sleep apnea incorporates a mask, a flexible hose and a chamber for collecting expired air containing CO<sub>2</sub>. A sensor detects apnea and a control system automatically adjusts the amount of rebreathed CO<sub>2</sub> minimize apnea and also minimize arousal.\nDocument [3]: Title: Practice parameters for the use of autotitrating continuous positive airway pressure devices for titrating pressures and treating adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: an update for 2007. An American Academy of Sleep Medicine report. Abstract: These practice parameters are an update of the previously published recommendations regarding the use of autotitrating positive airway pressure (APAP) devices for titrating pressures and treating adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at an effective setting verified by attended polysomnography is a standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). APAP devices change the treatment pressure based on feedback from various patient measures such as airflow, pressure fluctuations, or measures of airway resistance. These devices may aid in the pressure titration process, address possible changes in pressure requirements throughout a given night and from night to night, aid in treatment of OSA when attended CPAP titration has not or cannot be accomplished, or improve patient comfort. A task force of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine has reviewed the literature published since the 2002 practice parameter on the use of APAP. Current recommendations follow: (1) APAP devices are not recommended to diagnose OSA; (2) patients with congestive heart failure, patients with significant lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; patients expected to have nocturnal arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation due to conditions other than OSA (e.g., obesity hypoventilation syndrome); patients who do not snore (either naturally or as a result of palate surgery); and patients who have central sleep apnea syndromes are not currently candidates for APAP titration or treatment; (3) APAP devices are not currently recommended for split-night titration; (4) certain APAP devices may be used during attended titration with polysomnography to identify a single pressure for use with standard CPAP for treatment of moderate to severe OSA; (5) certain APAP devices may be initiated and used in the self-adjusting mode for unattended treatment of patients with moderate to severe OSA without significant comorbidities (CHF, COPD, central sleep apnea syndromes, or hypoventilation syndromes); (6) certain APAP devices may be used in an unattended way to determine a fixed CPAP treatment pressure for patients with moderate to severe OSA without significant comorbidities (CHF, COPD, central sleep apnea syndromes, or hypoventilation syndromes); (7) patients being treated with fixed CPAP on the basis of APAP titration or being treated with APAP must have close clinical follow-up to determine treatment effectiveness and safety; and (8) a reevaluation and, if necessary, a standard attended CPAP titration should be performed if symptoms do not resolve or the APAP treatment otherwise appears to lack efficacy.\nDocument [4]: Title: Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease. Abstract: Over the past few decades, sleep apnea has emerged as an important potential etiologic factor in a broad range of cardiac and vascular diseases. These disease conditions include hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. Recognition of the role of sleep apnea in clinical cardiology is also increasing in Japan. Although sleep apnea has been strongly linked to obesity in Western populations, in Japanese and other Asian populations there is evidence to indicate that sleep apnea may be prevalent even at lower levels of obesity. In this review we address the epidemiology of sleep apnea. Since sleep apnea includes the combined stresses of hypoxemia, apnea, and disrupted sleep, we also review briefly the potential disease mechanisms that may be activated as a consequence of sleep apnea. We further examine the role of sleep apnea in the pathophysiology and management of specific cardiovascular conditions. Overall, while the evidence of sleep apnea as a causal mechanism in cardiovascular disease is strong and increasing, definitive evidence of the etiologic role of sleep apnea has yet to be obtained. The evidence is most clear in patients with hypertension. Also remaining to be established is whether the treatment of sleep apnea prevents cardiac and vascular events. With regard to this question, although the available data strongly suggest that continuous positive airway pressure treatment is beneficial, randomized control trials are needed in order to confirm this.\nDocument [5]: Title: Perioperative treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder. Despite reports of its role as a risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality, only a few investigators have examined the optimal treatment of patients during this vulnerable period. Recognition of obstructive sleep apnea during conscious sedation or in the perioperative period is important to prevent the occurrence of adverse outcomes. This review discusses the influence of sedative, anesthetic, and analgesic agents and other factors during the perioperative period on patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The aim of this article is to emphasize the importance of recognizing and appropriately treating surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnea.\nDocument [6]: Title: When to Suspect Sleep Apnea and What to Do About It. Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep with resultant hypoxia-reoxygenation and sleep fragmentation, is prevalent among patients with cardiovascular disease. Refractory hypertension, nocturnal angina or arrhythmias, and stroke in particular should prompt consideration of OSA. The symptoms of OSA include snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness; risk factors include obesity and reduced upper airway dimensions. Up to 50% of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) may manifest OSA, central sleep apnea-Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA-CSR), or both. Patients with CSA-CSR may present with fatigue, disrupted sleep, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Objective sleep recording is required to document the nature and severity of sleep apnea. The gold standard is in-laboratory overnight polysomnography (PSG), including monitoring of electroencephalography and other signals to determine sleep-wake state, and recording of body position, airflow, respiratory effort, and pulse oximetry. Portable cardiorespiratory recorders are now approved for diagnosis in patients without comorbidities. Full PSG is recommended for diagnosis in all other cases, although OSA and CSA-CSR can be identified from portable recorders in some patients with CHF and other conditions. The objectives of treatment are to improve symptoms, quality of life, and cardiovascular outcomes. The mainstay of treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA is positive airway pressure (PAP). Automated PAP devices may be used in uncomplicated OSA, whereas continuous fixed PAP is the treatment of choice for other patients with OSA, and may also treat a proportion of patients with CSA-CSR. A form of bi-level PAP known as adaptive servoventilation is effective in treating a majority of patients with CSA-CSR.\nDocument [7]: Title: [Sleep Apnea]. Abstract: In 2017 the German Sleep Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schlafforschung und Schlafmedizin, DGSM) published the new S3 guideline \"Nonrestorative Sleep/Sleep Disorders, chapter \"Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders in Adults\".Sleep apnea contributes to an increased morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular diseases, e. g. coronary heart disease, heart failure and diabetes mellitus and is associated with an increased perioperative risk. It is also an important comorbidity in respiratory, neurologic and oncologic diseases. Treatment of sleep apnea can improve daytime sleepiness, quality of life und reduce blood pressure. In patients with atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea treatment should be optimized to improve treatment results. In addition to CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy and mandibular advancement devices, there are new therapies (e. g. hypoglossal nerve stimulation). Telemonitoring can help to improved therapy adherence. Nevertheless, in a current study CPAP could not prevent cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and established cardiovascular disease. Patients with predominantly central sleep apnea and systolic hear failure (left ventricular ejection fraction \u2264 45 %) had an increased cardiovascular mortality when treated with adaptive servoventilation. Therefore, ASV is contraindicated in this small group of patients. Further studies are ongoing.\nDocument [8]: Title: Simultaneous recording of ultrasound and polysomnography during natural sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: a pilot study. Abstract: Tongue base deformation may play a critical role in the phenomenon of obstructive sleep apnea, but polysomnography provides limited information regarding the effect of tongue motion during natural sleep. We reported on preliminary results of combining a novel ultrasound system and polysomnography for simultaneous recordings during natural sleep in volunteers and patients with obstructive sleep apnea. All participants underwent time-synchronized polysomnography and submental transcutaneous ultrasound examinations. The wearable ultrasound device detected the air-mucosal interface of the tongue surface and automatically determined the maximum tongue base thickness in real time. All participants reported no sensation of heat, no sign of skin allergy, and an average of mild disturbance after the ultrasound recordings. In the individual patient with obstructive sleep apnea, we demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the ultrasonic tongue base thickness measured during eupnea and that measured during snoring, hypopnea and apnea. The ultrasonic tongue base thickness increased and remained before the occurrence of obstructive apnea. On average, increased tongue base thicknesses of 2.5 (4.1%), 6.0 (9.8%) and 7.7 mm (12.5%) are associated with snoring, hypopnea and apnea, respectively. Our present data demonstrate that simultaneous examination of ultrasonic tongue base thickness and polysomnography is feasible for prolonged recording during natural sleep. The proposed method also enables the detection of significant differences in ultrasonic tongue base thickness between eupnea and obstructive respiratory events evaluated using polysomnography. This novel technique can be used to generate hypotheses for subsequent investigations of the underlying mechanisms and individualized combined therapy for obstructive sleep apnea.\nDocument [9]: Title: A review of pediatric nonrespiratory sleep disorders. Abstract: Sleep problems are extremely common during childhood, from infancy to adolescence. Despite the prevalence of sleep problems, childhood sleep disorders are often underrecognized and undiagnosed, despite being either preventable or treatable. Sleep impacts almost all aspects of a child's functioning, and thus the increased recognition and treatment of sleep disorders will positively affect a child's well-being. Children experience the same broad range of sleep disturbances encountered in adults, including sleep apnea, insomnia, parasomnia, delayed sleep phase, narcolepsy, and restless legs, but their clinical presentation, evaluation, and management may differ. Although snoring and sleep apnea may be the most common indication for an overnight sleep study in a child, one quarter of children presenting to a sleep clinic for evaluation will have a second sleep diagnosis, which is often nonrespiratory in nature. Especially in children, ruling out sleep apnea is rarely the end point of the sleep evaluation. Clinicians involved in sleep medicine must be prepared to recognize, evaluate, and manage plans for sleep disorders across the lifespan of the patient. This article will provide an updated review of nonrespiratory pediatric sleep disorders within a developmental framework.\nDocument [10]: Title: Prevalence and patterns of tongue deformation in obstructive sleep apnea: A whole-night simultaneous ultrasonographic and polysomnographic study. Abstract: Tongue deformation during whole-night natural sleep in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea has not been well evaluated. Through simultaneous ultrasonography and polysomnography during whole-night sleep, we examined the prevalence and patterns of tongue depth changes and their relationship with the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. Sixty consecutive eligible adults presenting with symptoms suggesting obstructive sleep apnea were enrolled. We observed that 88.4% (38/43) of patients with obstructive sleep apnea exhibited a significant increase in the maximum ultrasonographic tongue depth when hypopnea or apnea occurred during sleep. A mixed-model analysis of variance demonstrated that compared with patients with primary snoring or mild obstructive sleep apnea, those with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea have significantly greater maximum ultrasonographic tongue depth during respiratory events (p = .0047). We identified three different ultrasonographic patterns of tongue deformation, namely en bloc, tongue body and tongue base. Approximately 82% (27/33) of patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea demonstrated an en bloc tongue deformation. By contrast, 70% (19/27) of primary snorers or patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea showed a tongue body obstruction. Recognizing the prevalence and patterns of tongue deformation during sleep may provide insights into pathogenesis and treatment decisions in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Future studies are warranted to verify the treatment results of various tongue procedures by using this approach.\nDocument [11]: Title: Therapeutic Targeting of the Carotid Body for Treating Sleep Apnea in a Pre-clinical Mouse Model. Abstract: Sleep apnea with periodic cessation of breathing during sleep is a highly prevalent respiratory disorder affecting an estimated 10% of adults. Patients with sleep apnea exhibit several co-morbidities including hypertension, stroke, disrupted sleep, and neurocognitive and metabolic complications. Emerging evidence suggests that a hyperactive carotid body (CB) chemo reflex is an important driver of apneas in sleep apnea patients. Gasotransmitters carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) play important roles in oxygen sensing by the CB. We tested the hypothesis that an augmented CB chemo reflex stemming from disrupted CO-H<sub>2</sub>S signaling may lead to sleep apnea. This possibility was tested in mice deficient in hemeoxygenase-2 (HO-2), an enzyme involved in CO synthesis, which were shown to exhibit hyperactive CB activity due to high H<sub>2</sub>S levels. We found that HO-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit a high incidence of apneas during sleep compared to wild type mice. Blocking the CB hyperactivity with L-propargylglycine, an inhibitor of cystathionine-&#947;-lyase (CSE), which catalyzes H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis, prevented apneas in HO-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These findings suggest that targeting CB with inhibitors of CSE might be a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing sleep apnea.\nDocument [12]: Title: Obstructive sleep apnea: a new preventive and therapeutic target for stroke: a new kid on the block. Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and a major cause of mental and physical impairment. Numerous studies have identified risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and smoking. However, even after considering these well-recognized risk factors, there is substantial variation in stroke rates and stroke-related outcomes. There is emerging evidence that obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of stroke independently of traditional risk factors. Obstructive sleep apnea is present in the majority of patients with stroke and contributes to persistent neurologic impairment. Early recognition and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during the post-stroke period lead to better neurologic outcome. Healthcare providers should be aware of the strong association of obstructive sleep apnea as a risk factor for stroke and its effect on neurologic recovery. The presence of hypertension and diabetes-the 2 most common comorbid conditions in obstructive sleep apnea-should prompt diagnostic workup for and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea as a way of primary and secondary prevention of stroke.\nDocument [13]: Title: [COPD and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome]. Abstract: Overlap syndrome refers to the coexistence of COPD and obstructive sleep apneas-hypopneas in the same patient. This syndrome affects 1% of the adult population. There is no particular clinical presentation but patients with overlap syndrome show COPD with disproportionate hypercapnia, hypoxemia and dyspnea. These patients usually report loud snoring, poor quality of sleep and daytime drowsiness. There is also a tendency to rapidly develop pulmonary hypertension. The natural history of the syndrome is largely unknown but some preliminary results from the Zaragoza Sleep Cohort Study indicate a high probability of long-term cardiovascular mortality in patients with overlap syndrome not treated with non-invasive ventilation. Treatment of the syndrome is nonspecific. The treatment of overlap syndrome is specific to each of the two components and consequently the management of COPD should be individually tailored and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome and response to non-invasive ventilation should be evaluated.\nDocument [14]: Title: [Polysomnographic comparation between dexmedetomidine-induced sleep and natural sleep]. Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To compare the parameters of polysomnography (PSG) in sleep structure and respiratory events between dexmedetomidine-induced sleep and natural sleep. <b>Methods:</b> From April 2016 to September 2018, a total of 44 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 3 patients with simple snoring completed PSG monitor both in natural sleep and dexmedetomidine-induced sleep in Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital. The PSG parameters were statistically analysed with SPSS 22.0 software. <b>Results:</b> The average dose of dexmedetomidine was (104.60&#177;27.93) &#956;g, and there was no significant difference between the induced-sleep efficiency and the natural sleep efficiency (82.14%&#177;16.66% <i>vs.</i> 86.50%&#177;9.18%, <i>t</i>=-1.559, <i>P&gt;</i>0.05). There was no rapid eye movement(REM) stages in all 47 subjects and only 1 case of them had non-rapid eye movement(NREM) stage 3 in induced sleep. The percentage of NREM1 in total sleep time was statistically different between the two groups (42.10%&#177;26.71% <i>vs.</i> 17.47%&#177;11.68%, <i>t</i>=5.997, <i>P&lt;</i>0.001),but there was no significant difference in the percentage of NREM2 in total sleep time between the two groups (56.96%&#177;26.0% <i>vs.</i> 62.95%&#177;9.03%, <i>t</i>=-1.521, <i>P=</i>0.135). About respiratory events, there were significant differences in apnea hypopnea index ((46.29&#177;20.23)/h <i>vs.</i> (39.67&#177;25.41)/h), obstructive apnea index (25.20[10.50,45.40]/h <i>vs</i>. 16.20[3.30,35.20]/h) between induced-sleep and natural sleep (<i>t</i>=2.297, <i>Z</i>=-3.008, all <i>P&lt;</i>0.05), these difference were more significant in mild-to-moderate OSA. There were no statistically significant differences in central apnea index (0.00[0.00,2.80]/h <i>vs</i>. 0.40[0.10,1.20]/h), mixed apnea index (0.00[0.00,6.20]/h <i>vs</i>. 0.00[0.00,3.40]/h, hypopnea index (4.20[0.00,3.30]/h <i>vs</i>. 12.00[5.20,17.40]/h), <i>Z</i>=-0.110,-0.508,-1.544, all <i>P&gt;</i>0.05). There were statistical differences in the lowest oxygen saturation (84.77%&#177;7. 59% <i>vs.</i> 80.21%&#177;11.62%, <i>t</i>=2.558, <i>P=</i>0.014). <b>Conclusions:</b> There is no significant difference in sleep efficiency and NREM2 between dexmedetomidine induced sleep and natural sleep.NREM3 sleep is rare induced, but REM sleep is none of all. And dexmedetomidine induced sleep may aggravate obstructive sleep apnea, but not central apnea.\nDocument [15]: Title: Targeting volume overload and overnight rostral fluid shift: A new perspective to treat sleep apnea. Abstract: Sleep apnea is a common condition associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Continuous positive airway pressure and oral appliances are efficient for treating sleep apnea; however, they are often poorly tolerated. Therefore, alternative therapies are needed. Overnight rostral fluid shift has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea, particularly in conditions associated with fluid overload. Fluid shift predisposes to both obstructive and central sleep apnea, with the type of sleep apnea being related to whether the fluid shifts from the legs into the neck or chest, respectively. The amount of fluid that shifts from the legs to the upper part of the body at night is correlated with the severity of sleep apnea. As a result of this observation, it has been suggested that the prevention of overnight fluid shift may reduce sleep apnea severity. It has recently been shown that interventions targeting fluid overload and daytime fluid accumulation in the legs consistently attenuate nocturnal fluid shift and sleep apnea, as greater reductions in fluid shift are correlated with greater reductions in sleep apnea severity. This review will focus on interventions that counteract fluid shift, such as diuretics, ultrafiltration/dialysis, physical activity, compression stockings and salt/fluid restriction, which have been shown to have efficacy in reducing sleep apnea severity.\nDocument [16]: Title: Very low frequency component of heart rate variability as a marker for therapeutic efficacy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: Preliminary study. Abstract: Although positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is effective for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), some patients with severe OSA are intolerable to this treatment, which may lead to an increase in the mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep parameters during natural sleep and treatment of patients with OSA.\nDocument [17]: Title: Transoral robotic sleep surgery: the obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. Abstract: Nocturnal upper airway collapse is often multi-level in nature but typically will involve some degree of obstruction at the level of the tongue-base. Several surgical procedures have been developed in recent years to address this area in patients resistant to continuous positive airway pressure. This article outlines a novel way to treat obstructive sleep apnea lingual obstruction using the da Vinci robotic surgical system. This technique offers significant potential advantages over other established approaches and it should be included in the surgical armamentarium of sleep surgeons.\nDocument [18]: Title: The prevalence and awareness of sleep apnea in patients suffering chronic pain: an assessment using the STOP-Bang sleep apnea questionnaire. Abstract: Some patient subsets are at higher risk of sleep apnea, including patients with chronic pain. However, it is unclear whether patients and their caregivers are aware of the possibly increased risk of sleep apnea in this population. Chronic pain is often treated with opioids which may decrease both the central respiratory drive and the patency of the upper airway, potentially contributing to this sleep disorder. Using a self-reporting questionnaire approach in the chronic pain population, this study surveyed patient and caregiver awareness surrounding the risk of sleep apnea. In addition, we looked at the influence of opioid therapy on the prevalence of sleep apnea.\nDocument [19]: Title: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: natural history, diagnosis, and emerging treatment options. Abstract: Sleep apnea is an entity characterized by repetitive upper airway obstruction resulting in nocturnal hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. It is estimated that 2%-4% of the middle-aged population has sleep apnea with a predilection in men relative to women. Risk factors of sleep apnea include obesity, gender, age, menopause, familial factors, craniofacial abnormalities, and alcohol. Sleep apnea has been increasingly recognized as a major health burden associated with hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Increased airway collapsibility and derangement in ventilatory control responses are the major pathological features of this disorder. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold-standard method for diagnosis of sleep apnea and assessment of sleep apnea severity; however, portable sleep monitoring has a diagnostic role in the setting of high pretest probability sleep apnea in the absence of significant comorbidity. Positive pressure therapy is the mainstay therapy of sleep apnea. Other treatment modalities, such as upper airway surgery or oral appliances, may be used for the treatment of sleep apnea in select cases. In this review, we focus on describing the sleep apnea definition, risk factor profile, underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, associated adverse consequences, diagnostic modalities, and treatment strategies.\nDocument [20]: Title: Sleep-disordered breathing in patients with stroke-induced dysphagia. Abstract: This study examined the nature and characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea, in patients with post-stroke dysphagia, to determine the demographic, anthropometric and clinical variables that were associated with sleep-disordered breathing. Thirty-nine patients diagnosed with acute stroke (28 males and 11 females with a mean age of 72.3 \u00b1 10.0 years) underwent overnight polysomnography (within 3.9 \u00b1 1.6 days after admission). Sleep-disordered breathing was described by the apnea-hypopnea index and its obstructive and central components by the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index and central apnea-hypopnea index, respectively. Severity of dysphagia was assessed using the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability score. Severity of stroke and functional dependence were assessed by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and the modified Barthel index, respectively. Most of the cohort (87%) had moderate-to-severe dysphagia (Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability of 143.2 \u00b1 19.9). Sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index \u2265 5 events/hr) was present in 38 participants (97%) with a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 37.5 \u00b1 24.4 events/hr. Sleep-disordered breathing was predominantly obstructive in nature, with a mean obstructive apnea-hypopnea index and central apnea-hypopnea index of 19.6 \u00b1 15.7 and 11.4 \u00b1 17.6 events/hr, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that the apnea-hypopnea index was associated with sex (p = .0001), body mass index (p = .029) and the modified Barthel index (p = .006); the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was associated with the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (p = .006), sex (p = .004) and body mass index (p = .015) and had a nonlinear relationship with the modified Barthel index (p = .019); and the central apnea-hypopnea index was associated with sex (p = .027) and the modified Barthel index (p = .019). The present study showed that dysphagia severity was associated with obstructive sleep apnea severity and this association was independent of sex, modified Barthel index and body mass index. However, stroke-induced dysphagia was not associated with central sleep apnea or overall sleep-disordered breathing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a composite heterogeneous condition with multifactorial etiology like genetic, environmental factors and oxidative stress.

Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a heterogeneous syndrome of reproductive and metabolic alterations, is associated with increased long-term risk of cardiovascular complications. This phenomenon has been linked to an increase in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are pro-inflammatory molecules that trigger a state of intracellular oxidative stress and inflammation after binding to their cell membrane receptors RAGE. The activation of the AGE-RAGE axis has been well known to play a role in atherosclerosis in both men and women. Women with PCOS have systemic chronic inflammatory condition even at the ovarian level as represented by elevated levels of serum/ovarian AGEs and increased expression of the pro-inflammatory RAGE in ovarian tissue. Data also showed the presence of sRAGE in the follicular fluid and its potential protective role against the harmful effect of AGEs on ovarian function. Thus, whether AGE-RAGE axis constitutes a link between metabolic and endothelial dysfunction in women with PCOS is addressed in this review. Additionally, we discuss the role of hormonal changes observed in PCOS and how they are linked with the AGE-RAGE axis in order to better understand the nature of this complex syndrome whose consequences extend well beyond reproduction.\nDocument [3]: Title: Map4k4 is up-regulated and modulates granulosa cell injury and oxidative stress in polycystic ovary syndrome via activating JNK/c-JUN pathway: An experimental study. Abstract: The regulatory mechanism on granulosa cells (GCs) oxidative injury is becoming increasingly important in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) studies. Serine/threonine kinase mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 (Map4k4) is linked with oxidative injury and possibly associated with premature ovarian failure and ovarian dysgenesis. Herein, we investigated the function and mechanism of Map4k4 in a PCOS rat model. A microarray from GEO database identified Map4k4 was up-regulated in the ovarian of PCOS rats, and functional enrichments suggested that oxidative stress-associated changes are involved. We verified the raised Map4k4 expression in an established PCOS rat model and also in the isolated PCOS-GCs, which were consistent with the microarray data. Map4k4 knockdown in vivo contributed to regular estrous cycle, restrained steroid concentrations and ovarian injury in PCOS rats. Both Map4k4 silencing in vivo and in vitro attenuated the PCOS-related GC oxidative stress and apoptosis. Mechanically, Map4k4 activated the JNK/c-JUN signaling pathway. Importantly, a JNK agonist restored the suppressive effects of Map4k4 silencing on PCOS-induced granulosa cell injury and oxidative stress. Besides, Map4k4 may be a target gene of miR-185-5p. In conclusion, Map4k4, a potential target of miR-185-5p, is up-regulated and induces ovarian GC oxidative injury by activating JNK/c-JUN pathway in PCOS. The Map4k4/JNK/c-JUN mechanism may provide a new idea on the treatment of PCOS.\nDocument [4]: Title: Insulin resistance in non-obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: relation to byproducts of oxidative stress. Abstract: To get more insight into molecular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress and its link with insulin resistance, oxidative stress parameters, as well as, antioxidant enzyme activities were studied in young, non-obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Study was performed in 34 PCOS women and 23 age and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls. Plasma nitrotyrosine and malondialdehyde (MDA), representative byproducts of protein and lipid oxidative damage, were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Antioxidant enzyme activities, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were studied spectrophotometrically. Insulin resistance was calculated using homeostasis assessment model (HOMA-IR). Plasma nitrotyrosine and MDA were increased, but only nitrotyrosine was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in PCOS women compared to controls. Uric acid (surrogate marker of \u00d7 antine oxidase) was also significantly elevated in PCOS (p < 0.05). Both plasma SOD and GPX activity showed no statistically significant difference between PCOS and controls. Indices of insulin resistance (insulin and HOMAIR) were significantly higher in PCOS group and positively correlated with level of MDA (r = 0.397 and r = 0.523, respectively; p < 0.05) as well as GPX activity (r = 0.531 and r = 0.358, respectively; p < 0.05). Our results indicate that insulin resistance could be responsible for the existence of subtle form of oxidative stress in young, nonobese PCOS women. Hence, presence of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and oxidative damage are likely to accelerate slow development of cardiovascular disease in PCOS.\nDocument [5]: Title: Evaluation of pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) and its association with inflammatory cytokines in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Abstract: Chronic low-grade inflammation has been suggested as a key contributor of the pathogenesis and development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). To investigate the association between oxidative stress status and inflammatory cytokines in follicular fluid of 21 PCOS women compared to 21 women with normal ovarian function who underwent intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection. Concentration of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 was measured using sandwich ELISA. Oxidative stress was examined by measuring total oxidant status (TOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and thiol groups. PCOS women had an elevated concentration of MDA and TOS compared to controls. Levels of TAC and thiol groups were lower in PCOS compared to controls. PCOS patients had a higher concentration of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 compared to controls. Concentration of IL-10 was lower in PCOS compared to controls. Significant correlations were found between MDA and TOS concentration with TNF-\u03b1 and between IL-6 and MDA, IL-8 and TAC, IL-10 and TOS levels and also between IL-10 and TAC levels. TAC and thiol groups were negatively correlated with TNF-\u03b1. Increased oxidative stress in PCOS is associated with inflammation which is closely linked. Inflammation can induce production of inflammatory cytokines in this syndrome and directly stimulates excess ovarian androgen production.\nDocument [6]: Title: The effect of clomiphene citrate on oxidative stress parameters in polycystic ovarian syndrome. Abstract: This study aimed to examine the possible association between the oxidative stress parameters and clomiphene citrate resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome. The demographic data, hormone profiles and oxidant and antioxidant values of 50 clomiphene citrate-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome patients (Group 1), 32 clomiphene citrate-sensitive polycystic ovary syndrome patients (Group 2) and 87 non-polycystic ovary syndrome patients (Group 3) were compared. The average age, follicle-stimulating hormone, oestradiol, thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin values of the three groups were found to be homogeneous. Ferroxidase, catalase and myeloperoxidase levels were determined to be lower in the clomiphene citrate-resistant group compared to clomiphene citrate-sensitive and non-polycystic ovary syndrome groups (<i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.001). As a result, Polycystic ovary syndrome patients with clomiphene resistance had lower antioxidant (catalase and ferroxidase) levels compared to those who were sensitive to clomiphene and who did not have polycystic ovary syndrome. The myeloperoxidase levels also demonstrated the same trend, which might be due to a compensation mechanism.Impact Statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> In the literature, there are many studies evaluating the association between PCOS and oxidative stress. No research related to antioxidants in clomiphene citrate-sensitive and clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS patients was found in the relevant literature.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> In this study, the antioxidants catalase and ferroxidase were found to be lower in PCOS women compared to non-PCOS; however, they were the lowest in clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS women. Interestingly, myeloperoxidase, which is a part of oxidative stress, was also found to be higher in the non-PCOS group.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> This study contributes to the literature because it is the first to compare the relation between CC and oxidant and antioxidant markers. These markers will be a guide for PCOS management in patients with CC-R.\nDocument [7]: Title: Potential role of d-<i>chiro</i>-inositol in reducing oxidative stress in the blood of nonobese women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Abstract: d-<i>chiro</i>-Inositol (DCI), an isomer of inositol, possesses antioxidative and endothelial protective properties. Possibly due to a deficiency of insulin mediators, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is often associated with insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinemia, likely responsible for an elevated production of reactive oxygen species. We investigated oxidative-related alterations of inositol in the blood of women with PCOS before and after treatment with DCI. A total of 38 normal-weight PCOS women were investigated before and after DCI administration (500&#8201;mg/day for 12 weeks; <i>n</i>&#160;=&#160;38) by evaluating serum testosterone, serum androstenedione, fasting serum insulin, fasting serum glucose, and parameters of IR. From the blood, we determined biomarkers of oxidative stress: superoxide anion radicals, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, and the index of lipid peroxidation. The activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase and the reduced glutathione (GSH) content in the hemolysate were also assessed. Data showed that PCOS patients' plasma underwent oxidative stress, as indicated by the higher level of prooxidants and reduced cytosolic GSH content. DCI treatment significantly improved the metabolic parameters. Also, serum values of testosterone were reduced. In conclusion, PCOS patients suffer from a systemic oxidative stress that induces endothelial dysfunction. Treatment with DCI is effective in reducing hormonal, metabolic, and oxidative abnormalities in PCOS patients by improving IR.\nDocument [8]: Title: Oxidative stress and antioxidant imbalance in ovulation disorder in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine disease that is characterized by oligo-ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries observed using ultrasound with high clinical heterogeneity. At present, the etiology of PCOS is not clear but is thought to be related to genetic, metabolic, endocrine and environmental factors. Hyperandrogenism interacts with insulin resistance and overweight/obesity, forming a vicious cycle of mutual promotion and participating in the occurrence and progression of PCOS. Oxidative stress (OS) refers to the imbalance between the oxidation system and antioxidation system in the human body, which is associated with the occurrence and development of various diseases. Recent studies have shown that OS may be closely related to ovulation disorders in PCOS, and antioxidants can improve the oxidative stress state of PCOS. However, previous studies did not examine the effect of the interaction between OS and hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance or overweight/obesity on ovulation disorders in PCOS. This article reviews the interaction between OS and hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance and overweight/obesity; the effects of OS, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance and overweight/obesity on ovulation disorders in PCOS; and the application of antioxidants in PCOS.\nDocument [9]: Title: Metabolism alteration in follicular niche: The nexus among intermediary metabolism, mitochondrial function, and classic polycystic ovary syndrome. Abstract: Classic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a high-risk phenotype accompanied by increased risks of reproductive and metabolic abnormalities; however, the local metabolism characteristics of the ovaries and their effects on germ cell development are unclear. The present study used targeted metabolomics to detect alterations in the intermediate metabolites of follicular fluid from classic PCOS patients, and the results indicated that hyperandrogenism but not obesity induced the changed intermediate metabolites in classic PCOS patients. Regarding the direct contact, we identified mitochondrial function, redox potential, and oxidative stress in cumulus cells which were necessary to support oocyte growth before fertilization, and suggested dysfunction of mitochondria, imbalanced redox potential, and increased oxidative stress in cumulus cells of classic PCOS patients. Follicular fluid intermediary metabolic profiles provide signatures of classic PCOS ovary local metabolism and establish a close link with mitochondria dysfunction of cumulus cells, highlighting the role of metabolic signal and mitochondrial cross talk involved in the pathogenesis of classic PCOS.\nDocument [10]: Title: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Oxidative Stress-From Bench to Bedside. Abstract: Oxidative stress (OS) is a condition that occurs as a result of an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify and neutralize them. It can play a role in a variety of reproductive system conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, preeclampsia, and infertility. In this review, we briefly discuss the links between oxidative stress and PCOS. Mitochondrial mutations may lead to impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and an increased production of ROS. These functional consequences may contribute to the metabolic and hormonal dysregulation observed in PCOS. Studies have shown that OS negatively affects ovarian follicles and disrupts normal follicular development and maturation. Excessive ROS may damage oocytes and granulosa cells within the follicles, impairing their quality and compromising fertility. Impaired OXPHOS and mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to insulin resistance (IR) by disrupting insulin signaling pathways and impairing glucose metabolism. Due to dysfunctional OXPHOS, reduced ATP production, may hinder insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, leading to IR. Hyperandrogenism promotes inflammation and IR, both of which can increase the production of ROS and lead to OS. A detrimental feedback loop ensues as IR escalates, causing elevated insulin levels that exacerbate OS. Exploring the relations between OS and PCOS is crucial to fully understand the role of OS in the pathophysiology of PCOS and to develop effective treatment strategies to improve the quality of life of women affected by this condition. The role of antioxidants as potential therapies is also discussed.\nDocument [11]: Title: Oxidative Stress and Low-Grade Inflammation in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Controversies and New Insights. Abstract: The pathophysiology of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is quite complex and different mechanisms could contribute to hyperandrogenism and anovulation, which are the main features of the syndrome. Obesity and insulin-resistance are claimed as the principal factors contributing to the clinical presentation; in normal weight PCOS either, increased visceral adipose tissue has been described. However, their role is still debated, as debated are the biochemical markers linked to obesity per se. Oxidative stress (OS) and low-grade inflammation (LGI) have recently been a matter of researcher attention; they can influence each other in a reciprocal vicious cycle. In this review, we summarize the main mechanism of radical generation and the link with LGI. Furthermore, we discuss papers in favor or against the role of obesity as the first pathogenetic factor, and show how OS itself, on the contrary, can induce obesity and insulin resistance; in particular, the role of GH-IGF-1 axis is highlighted. Finally, the possible consequences on vitamin D synthesis and activation on the immune system are briefly discussed. This review intends to underline the key role of oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation in the physiopathology of PCOS, they can cause or worsen obesity, insulin-resistance, vitamin D deficiency, and immune dyscrasia, suggesting an inverse interaction to what is usually considered.\nDocument [12]: Title: Antioxidant status in relation to heavy metals induced oxidative stress in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a global health concern for women of reproductive age, as 6.5% of women worldwide are affected by this syndrome. PCOS is marked by hyperandrogenism, anovulation, menstrual abnormalities, and polycystic ovaries. Metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury are considered to be systemic toxicants/human carcinogens and seem to have devastating effects on humans, even at minimal exposures. One of the probable aetiological factors for PCOS has been identified as oxidative stress. In view of the probable associations among oxidative stress, metal toxicity and PCOS, the present study examined the role of heavy metals in the generation of oxidative stress among females. This prospective study included 106 women (56 women diagnosed with PCOS and 50 women who were not diagnosed with PCOS as control women). There were no significant differences in the sociodemographic characteristics between the two groups except for the irregularity of menses and the presence of acne. The serum As, Cd, Pb, and Hg levels increased and the serum glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels diminished significantly in the PCOS group compared to the control group at P < 0.001. The SOD levels were negatively correlated with the As and Pb levels at P < 0.05. Additionally, the PCOS group exhibited a strong negative correlation between the GSH and As levels (P < 0.01), GSH and Pb levels (P < 0.05) and GSH and Hg levels (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the As levels were positively correlated with increased levels of Cd, Pb and Hg among PCOS women. Significant positive correlations were observed between Pb and Cd and between Cd and Hg at P < 0.001. The outcome of the study provides clear insight into the role of metal-induced oxidative stress, which plays a vital role in the pathophysiology underlying PCOS and suggests the use of these markers as prognostic tools to reduce the consequences of high-risk exposure to these metals among females.\nDocument [13]: Title: [Study on the oxidative stress in the ovaries of a rat model of polycystic ovary]. Abstract: To establish a pathological animal model of polycystic ovary (PCO) by letrozole in rats. Investigate whether PCO were mediated by the effect of oxidative stress by measuring oxidative stress levels in this cohort of rats with PCO, and proceed a new way of treatment for polycystic ovary syndrom (PCOS).\nDocument [14]: Title: Paraoxonase-1 is not affected in polycystic ovary syndrome without metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, but oxidative stress is altered. Abstract: Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity is decreased in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) having metabolic syndrome (MetS) or insulin resistance (IR). We aimed to assess PON1 activity and oxidative stress in PCOS without MetS or IR. Metabolic and hormonal parameters, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), oxidative stress parameters (total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidative stress (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), total free sulfhydryl (--SH) groups), PON and arylesterase were analyzed in 30 normal weighed patients with PCOS without MetS or IR and 20 normal controls. Hs-CRP, PON, arylesterase, and TAS levels of PCOS and control groups were similar. LOOH, TOS, and OSI of PCOS group were higher than in the controls (p < 0.05; p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). - SH group levels showed a positive correlation with free testosterone (fT). TOS positively correlated with free androgen index (FAI), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), LOOH, and OSI. This study showed that oxidative stress is increased in PCOS even in the absence of MetS or IR. PON1 activity appears not to be affected in PCOS without MetS and IR. Several metabolic and antropometric risk factors may aggravate this altered oxidative state in PCOS.\nDocument [15]: Title: Polycystic ovarian syndrome is linked to increased oxidative stress in Omani women. Abstract: Literature emerging from Western countries has reported increased levels of serum oxidative stress markers among polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women. In the Arab region, there is limited research about the association between oxidative stress and PCOS. This study aimed to compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, sex hormones, and oxidative stress indices between PCOS women and non-PCOS women and to investigate the correlation between oxidative stress biomarkers and sex hormones.\nDocument [16]: Title: The presence of antibodies to oxidative modified proteins in serum from polycystic ovary syndrome patients. Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women of reproductive age. Free radicals, as a product of oxidative stress, impair cells and tissue properties related to human fertility. These free radicals, together with the oxidized molecules, may have a cytotoxic or deleterious effects on sperm and oocytes, on early embryo development or on the endometrium. Aldehyde-modified proteins are highly immunogenic and circulating autoantibodies to new epitopes, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), may affect the reproductive system. Autoantibodies or elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in serum are often associated with inflammatory response. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether PCOS women show increased levels of oxidized proteins (protein-MDA) and anti-endometrial antibodies (AEA) in their sera, compared with control patients, and to determine whether AEA specificity is related to oxidized protein derivatives. Sera from 31 women [10 patients with PCOS (PCOS group) and 21 women with male factor of infertility (control group)] were chosen from patients attending for infertility. Anti-endometrial antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with an endometrial cell line (RL-95). Antibodies against MDA modified human serum albumin (HSA-MDA) were also determined by ELISA. Oxidized proteins (protein-MDA) in serum were determined by a colorimetric assay. Patients with PCOS have significantly higher levels of AEA and anti-HSA-MDA, as well as oxidized proteins (protein-MDA) in serum than control patients. For the first time, we describe an autoimmune response in PCOS patients, in terms of AEA. The evidence of protein-MDA in the serum of these patients, together with the increased antibody reactivity to MDA-modified proteins (HSA-MDA) in vitro, supports the conclusion that oxidative stress may be one of the important causes for abnormal endometrial environment with poor embryo receptivity in PCOS patients.\nDocument [17]: Title: Effect of Nutritional Supplementation on Oxidative Stress and Hormonal and Lipid Profiles in PCOS-Affected Females. Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects several reproductive and endocrine features in females and has a poorly understood etiology. Treatment strategies for PCOS are limited and are based primarily on diet and nutrient supplementation. Recent studies have recommended some nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and vitamin-like nutrients for the therapy for PCOS. Therefore, it is claimed that the cause of PCOS could be vitamin or mineral deficiency. This review provides a narrative on the effect of nutritional supplementation on oxidative stress induced in PCOS. Oxidative stress plays a formative role in PCOS pathophysiology. This article reviews oxidative stress, its markers, nutritional supplementation and clinical studies. We also aim to show the effect of nutritional supplementation on genes affecting hormonal and glucose-mediated pathways.\nDocument [18]: Title: Caffeic acid's role in mitigating polycystic ovary syndrome by countering apoptosis and ER stress triggered by oxidative stress. Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age, characterized by androgen-induced oxidative stress leading to several metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effect of caffeic acid on PCOS and its underlying molecular mechanism. We used a human ovarian granulosa cell line (KGN cells) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to examine how caffeic acid influences the protein expression of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis-related markers. Our results indicate that caffeic acid significantly inhibits intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and safeguards KGN cells against oxidative stress. For the in vivo aspect of our study, female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were utilized to induce the PCOS model using dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Caffeic acid was then administered to the rats for a duration of 6 weeks. The outcomes revealed that caffeic acid effectively improved irregular estrous cycles, fasting blood glucose levels, liver function, and lipid profiles in DHEA-induced PCOS rats. Additionally, it mitigated hyperandrogenism, enhanced steroidogenesis enzyme expression, and modulated apoptosis-related protein expression. Our findings strongly suggest that caffeic acid holds promising potential in reducing oxidative stress-induced damage and ameliorating PCOS-related complications by modulating ER stress.\nDocument [19]: Title: Vitamin D improves levels of hormonal, oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters in polycystic ovary syndrome: a meta-analysis study. Abstract: Hyperandrogenism (HA), inflammation, and oxidative damage play key roles in the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Whether vitamin D adjuvant therapy improves hormonal, inflammation, and oxidative damage in PCOS patients has aroused widespread interest, but the results are controversial. To evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on hormonal, oxidative stress, and inflammatory parameters in patients with PCOS.\nDocument [20]: Title: Tempol ameliorates polycystic ovary syndrome through attenuating intestinal oxidative stress and modulating of gut microbiota composition-serum metabolites interaction. Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine and metabolic disorder, which is often accompanied by oxidative stress. Tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, protects against several diseases caused by oxidative stress. However, the effect of tempol on PCOS has not been investigated. The present study demonstrated the alleviation of ovarian dysfunction and glucose tolerance in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS rats treated with tempol. Tempol significantly reduced the intestinal oxidative stress in PCOS rats without affecting the ovarian redox rate. The 16S rDNA sequencing of the intestinal microbiome and non-targeted metabolomics analysis indicated significant differences in gut microbiota composition and serum metabolite profiles between the control and PCOS rats, and most of these differences were reduced after tempol intervention. Tempol alters the gut microbiome by increasing the abundance of genus Ruminococcus_1 and by decreasing the abundance of Ruminococcus_2, Staphylococcus, Ideonella, and Corynebnacterium genera. Tempol also attenuates the reduction of serum bile acid and stachyose levels in PCOS rats, and the serum stachyose level was significantly correlated with the abundance of 15 genera, particularly Ruminococcus_1 and Ruminococcus_2. Moreover, stachyose administration improved ovarian dysfunction in PCOS rats. Thus, our data indicate that tempol ameliorates PCOS phenotype by reducing intestinal oxidative stress, restoring gut dysbiosis, and modulating the interaction between gut microbiota and host metabolite. Therefore, tempol intervention is a potential therapeutic approach for PCOS.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is caused by haploinsufficiency in RUNX2 function. We have previously identified a series of RUNX2 mutations in Korean CCD patients, including a novel R131G missense mutation in the Runt-homology domain. Here, we examine the functional consequences of the RUNX2(R131G) mutation, which could potentially affect DNA binding, nuclear localization signal, and/or heterodimerization with core-binding factor-beta (CBF-beta). Immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis with subcellular fractions show that RUNX2(R131G) is localized in the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that heterodimerization with CBF-beta is retained. However, precipitation assays with biotinylated oligonucleotides and reporter gene assays with RUNX2 responsive promoters together reveal that DNA-binding activity and consequently the transactivation of potential of RUNX2(R131G) is abrogated. We conclude that loss of DNA binding, but not nuclear localization or CBF-beta heterodimerization, causes RUNX2 haploinsufficiency in patients with the RUNX2(R131G) mutation. Retention of specific functions including nuclear localization and binding to CBF-beta of the RUNX2(R131G) mutation may render the mutant protein an effective competitor that interferes with wild-type function.\nDocument [2]: Title: Mutational analysis of RUNX2 gene in Chinese patients with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor-encoding gene, RUNX2. To correlate different RUNX2 mutations with CCD clinical spectrum, we studied six independent Chinese CCD patients. In five patients, mutations were detected in the coding region of the RUNX2 gene, including two frameshift mutations and three missense mutations. Of these mutations, four were novel and one had previously been reported. All the detected mutations were exclusively clustered within the Runt domain that affected conserved residues in the Runt domain. In vitro green fluorescent protein fusion studies showed that the three mutations--R225L, 214fs and 172fs--interfered with nuclear accumulation of RUNX2 protein, while T200I mutation had no effect on the subcellular distribution of RUNX2. There was no marked phenotypic difference between patients in craniofacial and clavicles features, while the expressivity of supernumerary teeth in our patient cohort had a striking variation, even among family members. The occurrence of intrafamilial clinical variability raises the view that hypomorphic effects and genetic modifiers may alter the clinical expressivity of these mutations. Our results provide new genetic evidence that mutations involved in RUNX2 contribute to CCD.\nDocument [3]: Title: An Exploration of Mutagenesis in a Family with Cleidocranial Dysplasia without <i>RUNX2</i> Mutation. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant inheritable skeletal disorder characterized by cranial dysplasia, clavicle hypoplasia, and dental abnormalities. Mutations involving Runt-related transcription factor 2 (<i>RUNX2</i>) are currently the only known molecular etiology for CCD but are not identified in all CCD patients. No <i>RUNX2</i> abnormality can be detected in about 20-30% of patients, and the molecular cause remains unknown. The present study includes a family case with typical features of CCD. <i>RUNX2</i> mutation was first screened by sequencing analysis, and no mutation was detected. Copy number alterations of the <i>RUNX2</i> gene were then measured by quantitative PCR and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). No copy number variation in <i>RUNX2</i> could be detected. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the underlying genetic mutations. Unexpectedly, no abnormalities could be detected in genes related to the RUNX2 signaling pathway. Therefore, it was supposed that other new unknown gene variations might contribute to the CCD phenotype. We focused on Immunoglobulin superfamily member 10 (<i>IGSF10</i>), a gene related to bone development. An <i>IGSF10</i> frameshift mutation (c.6001_6002delCT, p.Leu2001Valfs*24) was detected by WES. Sanger sequencing verified that this mutation was only detected in the patient and her affected mother but not in her unaffected father. Bioinformatics studies demonstrated that this mutation could change the 3D structure of the IGSF10 protein and severely damage its function. In addition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the ability to form mineralized nodules were inhibited by IGSF10 knockdown compared with normal controls. The expression of bone sialoprotein (BSP) was significantly reduced by IGSF10 knockdown, but not that of other osteogenic markers. Our results provide new genetic evidence that <i>IGSF10</i> mutation might contribute to CCD.\nDocument [4]: Title: A novel gene mutation of Runx2 in cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Haploinsufficiency of the runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) gene is widely known to be responsible for cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). To date, more than 190 mutations in Runx2 gene have been reported to be related to CCD. In this study, a novel mutation of Runx2 gene was observed in a female with CCD. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral venous blood of the proband and eleven members of her family. Genetic testing on these twelve people identified a novel missense mutation (c.895 T>C, Y299H) in exon 5 of the RUNX2 gene in the proband. This mutation results in an amino acid change at codon 895 (P.Tyr 299 His.) from a tryptophan codon (TAT) to a histidine codon (CAT). Our finding may further extend the known mutation spectrum of the RUNX2 gene, and facilitate prenatal genetic diagnosis of CCD in the future.\nDocument [5]: Title: Functional analysis of novel RUNX2 mutations identified in patients with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) is a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, cartilage and bone development. Pathogenic variants in RUNX2 have been linked to the Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), which is characterized by hypoplasia or aplasia of clavicles, delayed fontanelle closure, and dental anomalies. Here, we report 11 unrelated Polish patients with CCD caused by pathogenic alterations located in the Runt domain of RUNX2. In total, we identified eight different intragenic variants, including seven missense and one splicing mutation. Three of them are novel: c.407T>A p.(Leu136Gln), c.480C>G p.(Asn160Lys), c.659C>G p.(Thr220Arg), additional three were not functionally tested: c.391C>T p.(Arg131Cys), c.580+1G>T p.(Lys195_Arg229del), c.652A>G p.(Lys218Glu), and the remaining two: c.568C>T p.(Arg190Trp), c.673C>T p.(Arg225Trp) were previously reported and characterized. The performed transactivation and localization studies provide evidence of decreased transcriptional activity of RUNX2 due to mutations targeting the Runt domain and prove that impairment of nuclear localization signal (NLS) affects the subcellular localization of the protein. Presented data show that pathogenic variants discovered in our patients have a detrimental effect on RUNX2, triggering the CCD phenotype.\nDocument [6]: Title: Novel RUNX2 frameshift mutations in Chinese patients with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a skeletal disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene. We evaluated the phenotypes of eight Chinese patients with CCD from three unrelated families followed by analysis of the RUNX2 genes. Three different RUNX2 frameshift mutations were identified. Two of the mutations are novel (c.887insC and c.592delA) and one (c.90insC) has been described previously. Surprisingly, the patient with the most severely truncated RUNX2 protein (c.90insC) had the mildest phenotype. The RUNX2 mutations identified were assessed for their effect on the subcellular localization of the mutant RUNX2 proteins because of previously reported inconsistent findings. All three mutant proteins showed at least partially impaired nuclear localization compared with wild-type RUNX2, which was localized exclusively in the nucleus. Our findings support the notion that haploinsufficiency of RUNX2 may be mainly responsible for CCD. However, because the correlation between the severity of the phenotype and the degree of mutational impairment of RUNX2 is not consistent, other factors, such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and negative dominant effects, may also play a role. In addition, we show that despite the presence of the best characterized nuclear localization signal, nuclear translocation of truncated RUNX2 can be inhibited, possibly as a result of precipitation in the cytoplasm.\nDocument [7]: Title: Mutations in the RUNX2 gene in Chinese patients with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant inheritable skeletal disease caused by heterozygous mutations in an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, RUNX2. Mutational analyses of RUNX2 were done on 4 unrelated Chinese patients with CCD. One nonsense and 3 missense mutations were detected, including one novel mutation, a heterozygous G to C transition mutation at nucleotide 475 in exon 2, which converts glycine to arginine at codon 159 (G159R). Two mutations, R225W and R391X, were reported in Chinese patients with CCD for the first time. Our findings show that R225 mutations interfere with nuclear accumulation of RUNX2 protein, and that a lack of nuclear RUNX2 protein accumulation is at least one of the causes of haploinsufficiency in these cases. Body stature was significantly reduced in the 3 male and 1 female cases. The cases all had malformations of the tarsometatarsal joints. In 1 case, the humeroulnar joints and humeroradial joints were abnormal, and the elbow looked like a triangle. The data suggest that an impaired runt domain contributes to the short stature of CCD patients. We postulate that RUNX2 influences joint formation by affecting the differentiation pathways of chondrocytes and osteoblasts.\nDocument [8]: Title: Functional analysis of novel RUNX2 mutations in cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal disorder caused by mutation of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene. The purpose of this study was to explore novel RUNX2 mutations in seven individuals with CCD and investigate the function of the mutant RUNX2 proteins. DNA samples were prepared from the peripheral blood of the CCD individuals, and then subjected to DNA sequencing. Conservation and secondary structure analysis were performed based on RUNX2 sequencing results. pEGFP-C1 plasmids containing GFP-tagged wild-type RUNX2 and three novel RUNX2 mutations expression cassettes were constructed, and then transfected into HEK293T cells. Cell fluorescence, luciferase assay and western blotting were used to analyse the subcellular distribution and function of the mutant RUNX2 proteins. Three novel mutations (R193G, 258fs, Y400X) were found in the seven CCD patients. Conservation and structure analysis show one novel mutation (R193G) in Runt domain and two novel mutations (258fs and Y400X) in PST domain of RUNX2. Western blotting confirmed that the 258fs and Y400X mutations produced truncated proteins. Fluorescence detection showed that the three novel mutants localised exclusively in the nucleus. However, luciferase assay indicated all mutants severely impaired the transactivation activities of RUNX2 on osteocalcin promoter. Our results broaden the spectrum of RUNX2 mutations in CCD individuals and demonstrated that loss of function in RUNX2 is responsible for CCD.\nDocument [9]: Title: A novel small deletion mutation in RUNX2 gene in one Chinese family with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a skeletal dysplasia with autosomal-dominant inheritance. The runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene is the only gene in which mutations are known to cause CCD. We report identification of a novel small deletions mutation in the RUNX2 gene in a Chinese family with CCD. A 29-year-old female was diagnosed as proband of CCD based on the clinical findings, which show delayed closure of the fontanels, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles and dental anomalies. Similar dental and skeletal symptoms were also observed in the other three affected individuals. We prepared genomic DNA from all four affected individuals, unaffected individual from her family members, as well as 100 unrelated healthy controls. PCR was conducted using the above genomic DNA as template and the RUNX2 gene-specific primers. The PCR product was subjected to direct sequencing and the sequence was compared to that of RUNX2 gene within the NCBI database. We detected a small deletion CCTA from nucleotide 635 to nucleotide 638 in exon 3 of RUNX2 gene of the proband. This will lead to the introduction of a translational stop codon at codon 220, resulting in a truncated RUNX2 protein, and therefore within the runt domain of the RUNX2 protein. We detected the same mutation in the the other three affected individuals, and did not detect any mutation in the unaffected family members or the 100 unrelated healthy controls, demonstrating that this is a novel missense mutation in RUNX2 gene and therefore, contributes to the molecular diagnosis of CCD.\nDocument [10]: Title: A limb-girdle myopathy phenotype of RUNX2 mutation in a patient with cleidocranial dysplasia: a case study and literature review. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare hereditary disorder that arises from heterozygous loss of function mutations in the runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene. As RUNX2 is mainly expressed in osteoblasts, CCD typically affects the skeletal and dental systems. Few studies have investigated RUNX2 mutation effects on non-skeletal systems. Here, we describe limb-girdle myopathy, an uncommon phenotype of CCD, in a patient with a heterozygous missense mutation (p.R225Q) in the RUNX2 gene.\nDocument [11]: Title: A novel mutation in the C-terminal region of RUNX2/CBFA1 distal to the DNA-binding runt domain in a Japanese patient with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant inherited skeletal disease with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Although many mutations in RUNX2/CBFA1, an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, have been identified as causes of CCD, it is unclear whether these mutation genotypes relate to various symptoms. Heterogeneous mutations of RUNX2/CBFA1 result in disease characterized by abnormal skeletal genesis and dental disorders. There are few reports describing the relation between detailed orofacial pathology and the RUNX2/CBFA1 genotype. The case of a Japanese patient with severe orofacial dysplasia who was clinically thought to have CCD is described here. The authors performed mutation analysis on the RUNX2/CBFA1 gene and identified a novel frameshift mutation (722delT), which produces a mutant RUNX2/CBFA1 with a truncating C-terminus distal to the runt domain.\nDocument [12]: Title: Novel Mutation of the <i>RUNX2</i> Gene in Patients with Cleidocranial Dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant disorder linked to mutations in the Runt-related transcription factor 2, encoded by the <i>RUNX2</i> gene, which is essential for osteoblast differentiation and skeletal development. Here, we describe a novel nonsense mutation (c.532C&gt;T; p.Q178X) in <i>RUNX2</i> identified in 3 affected members of a Polish family with CCD. The localization and transcriptional transactivation studies show that the mutated form of the protein has altered the subcellular localization and significantly decreased transactivation properties, respectively. Consequently, our data show that the c.532C&gt;T mutation generates a defective RUNX2 protein and is genetically linked to the CCD phenotype.\nDocument [13]: Title: RUNX2 analysis of Danish cleidocranial dysplasia families. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by mutations in the Runt gene RUNX2. Screening of 19 Danish CCD families revealed 16 pathogenic mutations (84%) representing 8 missense mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 4 frame-shift mutations and 2 large deletions in the RUNX2 locus. Eight mutations were novel, two were found twice, and polymorphisms were found in the promoter region and in the conserved polyglutamine/polyalanine repeat. A large duplication downstream of RUNX2 found in one patient suggests a possible regulatory RUNX2 element. The CCD phenotypes and genotypes adhere to the large phenotypic variability reported in previous CCD studies. Identification of large chromosome aberrations in or near the RUNX2 locus in 3 of the 19 cases suggests copy number analyses to be included in future RUNX2 mutation analyses.\nDocument [14]: Title: Disease mutations in RUNX1 and RUNX2 create nonfunctional, dominant-negative, or hypomorphic alleles. Abstract: Monoallelic RUNX1 mutations cause familial platelet disorder with predisposition for acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). Sporadic mono- and biallelic mutations are found at high frequencies in AML M0, in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and AML, and in isolated cases of AML M2, M5a, M3 relapse, and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase. Mutations in RUNX2 cause the inherited skeletal disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). Most hematopoietic missense mutations in Runx1 involve DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain, whereas the majority of CCD mutations in Runx2 are predicted to impair CBFbeta binding or the Runt domain structure. We introduced different classes of missense mutations into Runx1 and characterized their effects on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain, and on Runx1 function in vivo. Mutations involving DNA-contacting residues severely inactivate Runx1 function, whereas mutations that affect CBFbeta binding but not DNA binding result in hypomorphic alleles. We conclude that hypomorphic RUNX2 alleles can cause CCD, whereas hematopoietic disease requires more severely inactivating RUNX1 mutations.\nDocument [15]: Title: A Glutamine Repeat Variant of the RUNX2 Gene Causes Cleidocranial Dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by hypoplastic clavicles and delayed closure of the cranial sutures, is caused by mutations of the runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene. The RUNX2 gene consists of a glutamine and alanine repeat domain (Q/A domain, 23Q/17A), a DNA-binding Runt domain and a proline/serine/threonine-rich domain. We report on a familial case of CCD with a novel mutation within the Q/A domain of the RUNX2 gene, which is an insertion in exon 1 (p.Q71_E72insQQQQ) representing the Q-repeat variant (27Q/17A). Functional analysis of the 27Q variant revealed abolished transactivation capacity of the mutated RUNX2 protein. This is the first case report that demonstrated a glutamine repeat variant of the RUNX2 gene causes CCD.\nDocument [16]: Title: Mutations and promoter SNPs in RUNX2, a transcriptional regulator of bone formation. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a dominantly inherited skeletal malformation syndrome with high penetrance and variable expressivity. It is caused by loss of function mutations in the RUNX2 gene that encodes for a transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation. To identify new pathogenic mutations associated with CCD we screened 38 CCD patients for mutations in the RUNX2 coding sequence. We also report the mutation screening of the \"bone-related\" RUNX2 promoter in CCD patients without mutation in the RUNX2 coding region. We identify eight new and three previously described mutations in the RUNX2 gene. Additionally, a total of five sequence variants in the RUNX2 promoter were detected. Three of them occur within putative zinc finger transcription factor binding sites. DHPLC analysis of chromosomes from the control population and CCD patients showed that two promoter sequence variants were unique for CCD families. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with protein extracts from ROS17/2.8 and C3H10T1/2 cell lines demonstrated that the promoter sequence variants altered DNA-protein binding specificity. Moreover, one of the variants significantly decreased the expression of a RUNX2 reporter gene in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells, but not in multipotent, mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells. Interestingly, one of these sites bound the TRPS1 transcription factor and we demonstrated that TRPS1 is able to repress the RUNX2 promoter. The in vitro functional studies in conjunction with analysis of clinical phenotype of CCD patients suggest that these promoter sequence variants may affect transcriptional activity of the RUNX2 gene. Analysis of the promoter variants and RUNX2-interacting proteins may help to identify important cis-elements and trans-factors that regulate the RUNX2 transcriptional network and identify new susceptibility markers for more common bone disorders.\nDocument [17]: Title: Novel RUNX2 mutations in Chinese individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an inherited autosomal-dominant skeletal disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor, RUNX2. We performed mutation analysis of RUNX2 on four unrelated Chinese individuals with CCD. Three novel distinct mutations were detected in the coding region of RUNX2: two missense and one frameshift. These mutations were exclusively clustered within the Runt domain. One missense mutation converts threonine to isoleucine at codon 200 (T200I). The other one substitutes leucine for arginine at codon 225 (R225L), which affects many family members. The frame-shift mutation (214fs) in exon3 leads to the introduction of a translational stop codon at codon 221, resulting in a truncated RUNX2 protein. The reporter gene assays revealed that all the mutants exhibited significantly reduced transactivation activities on the osteocalcin promoter. Our results provide new genetic evidence that mutations involved in RUNX2 contribute to CCD.\nDocument [18]: Title: A novel single-base deletion of the RUNX Family Transcription Factor 2 gene associated with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare, autosomal dominant hereditary disorder characterized by skeletal malformations and dental abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional role of a novel mutation in the pathogenesis of CCD. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from family members of a Chinese patient with CCD. An analysis of their RUNX Family Transcription Factor 2 (RUNX2) gene sequences was performed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. The function of the mutant RUNX2 was studied by bioinformatics, real-time PCR, western blotting, and subcellular localization analysis. Sanger sequencing identified a novel single-base deletion (NM_001024630.4:c.132delG;NP_001019801.3: Val45Trpfs<sup>*</sup> 99) in the RUNX2 gene present in the Chinese patient with CCD. In vitro, functional studies showed altered protein localization and increased expression of mutant RUNX2 mRNA and mutant Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the novel RUNX2 mutations significantly increased the transactivation activity of RUNX2 on the osteocalcin gene promoter. In conclusion, we identified a patient with sporadic CCD carrying a novel deletion/frameshift mutation of the RUNX2 gene and performed screening and functional analyses to determine the cause of the CCD phenotype. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of CCD.3.\nDocument [19]: Title: The effect of the cleidocranial dysplasia-related novel 1116_1119insC mutation in the RUNX2 gene on the biological function of mesenchymal cells. Abstract: Bone extracellular matrix deposition or bone formation by differentiated osteoblasts begins at late stage during bone formation and lasts throughout life. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow or dental pulp can respectively differentiate into osteoblasts and odontoblasts in vitro. However, the relationship between MSCs and bone/tooth development in cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) patient is still unclear. In this study, we investigated a patient with CCD, which is an autosomal-dominant, heritable skeletal disease caused by runt-related transcription factor 2 gene (RUNX2) mutation and is characterized by bone and dental anomalies. We found that the mutation is localized at c. 1116_1119insC, p. Q374fsX384 and the proliferative ability and osteogenic potential of the MSCs isolated from the bone marrow and dental pulp of the patient (RUNX2(+/m)) were decreased compared to normal individuals (RUNX2(+/+)). Furthermore, we were unable to recover the differentiation potential of RUNX2(+/m) MSCs isolated from the bone marrow (BMMSCs) upon manipulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which plays a critical role in stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and adult human MSCs differentiation. In conclusion, we identified a novel insertion/frameshift mutation in the RUNX2 gene that caused a typical CCD phenotype and altered the biological function of RUNX2(+/m) MSCs. The reduced ability of MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts might provide an explanation for the defects of bone and teeth in the CCD patient. Finally, we demonstrated that manipulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway could not overcome this absence.\nDocument [20]: Title: Analysis of novel RUNX2 mutations in Chinese patients with cleidocranial dysplasia. Abstract: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant inheritable skeletal disorder characterized by cranial dysplasia, clavicle hypoplasia and dental abnormalities. This disease is mainly caused by heterozygous mutations in RUNX2, a gene that encodes an osteoblast-specific transcription factor. In the present study, mutational analyses of RUNX2 gene were performed on four unrelated Chinese patients with CCD. Four different RUNX2 mutations were detected in these patients, including one nonsense mutation (c.199C>T p.Q67X) and three missense mutations (c.338T>G p.L113R, c.557G>C p.R186T and c.673C>T p.R225W). Among them, two mutations (c.199C>T p.Q67X and c.557G>C p.R186T) were novel and the other two had been reported in previous literatures. Except for Q67X mutation located in the Q/A domain, other three mutations were clustered within the highly conserved Runt domain. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and RUNX2 fusion protein analyses in vitro showed that nuclear accumulation of RUNX2 protein was disturbed by Q67X mutation, while the other two mutations (c.338T>G p.L113R and c.557G>C p.R186T) had no effects on the subcellular distribution of RUNX2. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that all the three novel RUNX2 mutations significantly reduced the transactivation activity of RUNX2 on osteocalcin promoter. Our findings enrich the evidence of molecular genetics that the mutations of RUNX2 gene are responsible for CCD.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: The hand consists of five sesamoids. Two of them are present at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb. Fracture of the sesamoid bones of the thumb is a rare injury and the literature on the radial side is seldom reported. We reported a case of a patient with a fracture of the radial sesamoid at the MCP joint of the thumb in order to increase attention regarding this type of injuries. A 44-year-old male, high level gymnastic trainer, was helping one of his athletes during an exercise while he reported a hyperextension trauma to the MCP joint of the right thumb. One week after trauma, he presented to the hand surgeon complaining of a painful thumb at the MCP joint level on its palmar aspect. Standard A-P and lateral X-rays revealed a fracture of the radial sesamoid and the fracture was treated with a splint for 3 weeks. He was able to resumed his entire work 6 weeks after the injury. The sesamoid fractures is an indicator of the magnitude of the hyperextension injury and sometimes associated with tears of the volar plate ligament of the MCP joint. And a failure to recognize the ligament injury may lead to a long-term hyperextension instability on pinching.\nDocument [2]: Title: Traumatic hand injuries: the emergency clinician's evidence-based approach. Abstract: At the start of your Saturday afternoon shift, you are not surprised to see that several patients are waiting to be seen for physical injuries. The first patient is a 34-year-old woman who sustained injury to her hand while skiing, 2 hours prior to her arrival. She reports falling with her hand still tethered to the pole's grip, landing on her outstretched right hand. She felt a painful snap in her right thumb, which still hurts, but otherwise she did not sustain any other trauma. Her only complaint currently is pain at the base of the right thumb. The patient is otherwise completely healthy, has no past medical or surgical history, and takes no medications. Upon examination, the affected hand appears to be surprisingly normal except for mild tenderness and swelling over the ulnar aspect of her first metacarpophalangeal joint and mildly decreased strength in her pincher grasp. X-ray reveals no fracture. You wonder if there is additional testing that should be done to evaluate this injury. You move on to a second patient, a 24-year-old man who cut his ring finger knuckle when he punched a wall 2 days ago. Physical examination reveals a small puncture wound over the IV metacarpophalangeal joint with mild swelling, erythema, warmth, and decreased range of motion secondary to pain. X-ray reveals no fracture, but there's something suspicious about this case. A third patient is a 37-year-old industrial worker whose finger contacted the stream of a high-powered grease injector. Physical examination reveals a small puncture wound over the volar proximal interphalangeal joint of his left long finger, mild tenderness to palpation over the area, and slight decreased range of motion secondary to pain. You wonder if the injury is as benign as it looks.\nDocument [3]: Title: Man with hand pain. Abstract: CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A right-hand dominant man was transferred to our institution for evaluation by the hand surgery service. He reported that the day prior he had been sliding a sheet of plywood across the ground when he lost his grip, causing the board to slide across his left hand. He presented to an outside hospital where local exploration of the wound did not reveal any foreign body. On arrival, he complained only of mild pain in his hand. Physical examination revealed erythema and swelling over the thenar eminence and a small open area without any drainage. Radiographs (figure 1) and ultrasonography (figures 2 and 3, online supplementary video 1 and 2) were performed.DC1SP110.1136/emermed-2018-207679.supp1Supplementary dataemermed;35/12/731/F1F1F1Figure 1Radiograph of the hand.emermed;35/12/731/F2F2F2Figure 2Long-axis ultrasonography of the hand.emermed;35/12/731/F3F3F3Figure 3Short-axis ultrasonography of the hand.

Abstract: There are several injuries potentially related to high-G exposure, including neck and back pain, spinal fractures, and pneumomediastinum. We present a young military pilot diagnosed with isolated fractures of the right 9th and 10th ribs via X-ray after high-G exposure (maximum G level: 9G). This patient presented with progressive and localized pain in the right anterior chest and flank region. After conservative treatment with rest and pain management, he recovered from the rib fractures and completed all profile challenges in the advanced high-G training program. A review of the annual health examination of the pilot did not show any rib lesions or other related illnesses. He was qualified for flying class II and considered fit for flight training. His medication history was unremarkable, and he did not have a family history of malignancy, osteoporosis, or osteopenia. He also denied having previously experienced trauma of the rib cage or participated in any strenuous military training program or exercise before centrifuge training. The potential explanations for the multiple rib fractures are repetitive stress from the anti-G straining maneuver and anti-G suit compression of the abdominal bladder. To our knowledge, consecutive rib fractures related to high-G exposure have never been documented. This report may increase the awareness of flight surgeons and training units regarding the risk of chest wall injuries during high-G exposure and encourage them to use multiple diagnostic tools to determine the correct diagnosis.\nDocument [5]: Title: Pelvic Ring and Peritrochanteric Fractures in a Patient with Osteogenesis Imperfecta Treated Surgically: Case Report with a 5-Year Follow-Up. Abstract: BACKGROUND Osteogensis imperfecta (OI) is a rare disorder associated with brittle bones, skeletal deformities, short stature, and conductive hearing loss. It is caused by mutations in genes encoding collagen type I production and is associated with multiple fractures occurring during a patient's lifetime. Atypical fractures can occur without a history of previous injury or diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 52-year old man sustained a fall from his own height. He experienced pelvic pain but could bear weight. He was referred to the hospital by his primary care physician and was admitted to the Orthopedic Department with a pelvic ring fracture. We performed open reduction and internal fixation with a reconstruction plate via an intrapelvic approach. At 12 weeks after discharge, he sustained a peritrochanteric fracture. It was surgically treated with a dynamic hip screw. The patient commenced weight-bearing 20 weeks after the initial procedure. Bone union was achieved clinically and radiographically. He did not have any revision procedures. At the time of this report, 5 years after the described period, he felt no discomfort around the hips, sacroiliac joints, and pubic symphysis. CONCLUSIONS OI poses a difficult treatment challenge, but, achieving a good clinical and functional result is possible with a precise surgical technique and meticulous preoperative planning. Clinicians should always consider the possibility of a simultaneous fracture occurrence in different parts of the body. Some patients present without a previous diagnosis, and we should always have some suspicion of OI in cases of young patients presenting with low-energy fractures.\nDocument [6]: Title: [What wrist fracture did Pouteau actually describe?]. Abstract: The so-called \" Pouteau-Colles\" fracture was never specifically described by Pouteau. This surgeon from Lyons wrote a paper published in his posthumous works in 1783. The author was allowed access to an original edition of the paper at the \"Ancienne Ecole de M\u00e9decine Navale de Rochefort\". When reading this paper, it seems that Pouteau described a great variety of different kinds of forearm fractures. His original contribution was to define the mechanism of injury as occurring during a fall on the outstretched hand as opposed to direct injury. Pouteau presents a hypothetical muscular theory of fracture pattern etiology, but one that is useful in the understanding of the displacemnt of the bone fragments. He questions the principal role attributed to sprains and luxations at this time in the differential diagnosis of forearm injury. He described four clinical signs to diagnose, at a glance, which bone was injured, the site of the fracture, its displacements and mechanism of inury. Pouteau also presented a precise method of reduction and an original system of immobilisation, able to accomodate secondary displacements and avoid complications that were not fully recognised at that time, namely compartment syndrome and nosocomial infection. Pouteau simply concludes with a question concerning the future methods needed to reduce bony collapse and to fill the bone defects. In order to render special homage to this visionary surgeon, the author propose to attribute to the nosologic entity \"fore-arm bone fractures\" the qualificative of \"Pouteau's fractures\", or to associate to every fracture of the fore-arm described by any other author the name of the Lyons surgeon!\nDocument [7]: Title: Horizontal (Transverse) Intraarticular Metacarpal Head Fracture in a Young Adult. Abstract: Metacarpal head fractures are rare injuries that usually occur during trauma. These fractures are classified into 10 groups, with horizontal (transverse) being the rarest type of fractures. To our knowledge, very few cases have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present the case of a 21-year-old male who sustained multiple ipsilateral hand injuries accompanied by a horizontal (transverse) fracture of the fourth metacarpal. He underwent open reduction and fixation with Kirschner wires followed by intensive rehabilitation. He finally regained complete active range of motion and grip strength three months after the operation. However, at nine months postoperatively, he developed avascular necrosis, which was asymptomatic and did not need any intervention. Therefore, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for possible complications and follow patients regularly, probably even for as long as 12 months after the initial injury.\nDocument [8]: Title: Unusual Clinical Course of Odontoid Fracture: Transient Prehospital Cardiopulmonary Arrest. Abstract: Odontoid fracture is the most common type of cervical spine fracture in the elderly. Neurological injury due to odontoid fracture is uncommon, but if the injury is severe, it can lead to cardiac arrest. We present a case of odontoid fracture with transient cardiac arrest just after the fall, which fully recovered in a few minutes before arrival at the hospital. A 62-year-old man fell down on a street, and compressions were performed by a witness. On arrival of the emergency medical service, he showed pulseless electrical activity. After two minutes of cardiac resuscitation, he experienced a return of spontaneous circulation and was breathing spontaneously. On arrival at our hospital, his blood pressure was 171/106 mmHg, heart rate was 100 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 12 times per minute, but he was at Glasgow Coma Scale 3 with an alcohol odor from exhaled breath. Six hours after admission, his level of consciousness improved, and he complained of neck pain and difficulty in movement of his arms and legs. CT revealed a fracture and posteriorly displaced C2 bone. MRI showed a hyper-intense area from C1 to C2. We made a diagnosis of spinal cord injury caused by an odontoid fracture that led to cardiac arrest. An odontoid fracture can cause transient cardiac arrest just after a fall. The possibility of odontoid fracture associated cervical spine injury should be considered in elderly and unconscious patients with minor trauma. Early CT cervical spine in selected patients can be helpful, especially in patients with cardiac arrest, even if it lasted for only a short prehospital period.\nDocument [9]: Title: Rapid onset bilateral palmar keratoderma in a psoriasis patient wearing orthopaedic hand splints. Abstract: A 37-year-old man with a history of chronic stable plaque psoriasis fractured both hands during a fall on his outstretched hands. Ten days later, following surgery and the application of tight fitting orthopaedic hand splints, the splints were removed because of a 7-day history of painful and pruritic palms. It was evident that the injury to his hands and the firm application of his splints had resulted in a dramatic flare of his psoriasis. This manifested in two clinical forms that he had not developed previously. He had a strikingly symmetrical palmar keratoderma that had k\u00f6bnerized maximally in the regions where the splints apposed his palms firmly. In addition, he had pustular psoriasis affecting the fingertips of both hands. After removal of the splints he responded to a combination of oral acitretin, and 6% coal tar and 6% salicylic acid in aqueous cream applied topically.\nDocument [10]: Title: James Hill of Dumfries: First modern neurosurgical procedures. Abstract: James Hill (1703-1776) was a surgeon from Dumfries in Scotland who can lay claim to being the first to treat head injury patients in a thoroughly modern manner. He was highly regarded in his lifetime and for a century afterwards but has subsequently been forgotten. He had the lowest surgical mortality for trepanation of any surgeon of his time. He uniquely presented his results after a lengthy follow-up of many years. His management of cranial fractures was advanced. He did not use the trepan for fissures as others did and his conservative management of depressed fractures was based on biological rather than mechanical notions. He had an instinct for the management of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) unique in his day even though he could not have understood it in modern terms. He operated on head injuries only if there was a disturbance of consciousness. He was aware of the importance of cerebral pulsation and was alone in recording it in a majority of operated patients. He was ready to open the dura when necessary and did so six times. He introduced non-compressive bandaging over skull defects after surgery. In three cases he shaved off brain hernias which resulted in marked clinical improvement. He not only understood that an injury or disease on one side caused a deficit on the other side but uniquely encompassed this knowledge in his treatment planning. In view of these many insights and achievements, he deserves to be considered as the first surgeon whose neurosurgical management is recognisably close to modern practice.\nDocument [11]: Title: A case of hemorrhagic shock due to intercostal artery injury that occurred during initial trauma care with multiple displaced rib fractures and traumatic head injury. Abstract: Rib fractures can cause injury to some organs. We herein report a case of hemorrhagic shock due to intercostal artery injury that occurred during initial trauma care (ITC) treated by resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) and transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with multiple displaced rib fractures (RFs) and traumatic head injury (THI). A man in his 50s who was injured in a traffic accident was transferred to our institution by helicopter for emergency medical treatment. He underwent left thoracic drainage on site. On admission, he was diagnosed with multiple RF, THI, pelvic fracture and right humerus fracture. His D-dimer and fibrin degradation products (FDP) level were extremely elevated. However, contrast enhance CT (CECT) revealed no extravasation. At 2 h after arrival, massive hemorrhaging from his thoracic tube suddenly occurred and his blood pressure decreased to approximately 40s mmHg. CECT performed after volume resuscitation and massive transfusion revealed extravasation from the intercostal artery. Because his blood pressure could not be maintained by massive transfusion, we performed RT and TAE followed by RT. He then received intensive care and several surgical procedures were performed, including craniotomy for removal of hematoma, rib fixation and humerus fixation. He was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation on day 63, with a GCS of 15. Hemorrhagic shock due to intercostal artery injury may occur at any time from arrival in cases with displaced RF, especially when complicated by THI.\nDocument [12]: Title: Internal fixation for fragility fracture of pelvis in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis. Abstract: Ankylosing spondylitis is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease with a prevalence of 0.1 %-1.4 %. The most common vertebral fractures associated with ankylosing spondylitis are cervical spine injuries due to low-energy trauma, whereas pelvic fractures are rare. Conversely, fragility fracture of the pelvis is a fracture of the pelvic ring caused by low-energy trauma with a background of bone fragility. In recent years, minimally invasive surgery for early mobilization of displaced fragility fracture of the pelvis has been reported. We report herein a case of a 91-year-old male with ankylosing spondylitis who underwent internal fixation for fragility fracture of his pelvis. He was brought to the emergency room with a complaint of pain in the right hip after a fall from a standing position at home. Computed tomography showed a fracture of the right pubis and a fracture, which crossed the sacrum from the ilium with a maximum dislocation. There was also extensive ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament in the thoracolumbar spine and bony ankylosis of both sacroiliac joints. The diagnosis after the injury was fragility fracture of the pelvis, which complicated by ankylosing spondylitis. The fracture type did not match the Rommens and Hofmann classification criteria. Iliac intramedullary stabilization was performed in accordance with the treatment of Rommens and Hofmann classification type IIIa. The patient's pain reduced a day after the surgery, and he was able to use a wheelchair. He was able to walk with a cane two months after the surgery, and bone union was achieved four months postsurgery. Iliac intramedullary stabilization was useful in patients with atypical fractures a) that did not fit the Rommens and Hofmann classification criteria owing to the presence of ankylosing spondylitis, and b) in cases wherein strong fixation was considered necessary.\nDocument [13]: Title: [On the death of Gabriel Cano de Aponte]. Abstract: Gabriel Cano de Aponte was Governor of Chile since 1717 and until his death in 1733, being 68 years old. As a soldier, he was an experienced horse rider. The sequence of events that caused his death three months after an equestrian accident is unclear. A systematic clinical analysis of the latter is the main objective of this review. Historians have documented Cano de Aponte's \"inclination for unbridled fun and equestrian exercises\". During a holiday Cano de Aponte suffered a horse fall and subsequent crushing by the latter. It has been stated that a spinal lesion caused by the accident kept him bedridden for a period of three months, clear in reason and with intense pain, before his death. However, there is no evidence on historic data that conveys any typical sign associated with spinal injury following the accident. Therefore we suggest that Cano de Aponte suffered a complex pelvic ring fracture. The fact that he was prostrated, lucid, but suffered an intense pain best sustains the hypothesis of a pelvic fracture. After the initial period, one of the most common causes of death resulting from a pelvic fracture is deep venous thrombosis with secondary pulmonary thromboembolism. This must have been the sequence of events that most probably caused Cano de Aponte's death.\nDocument [14]: Title: Bilateral comminuted radial shaft fractures from a single gunshot: fixation with alternative techniques. Abstract: Acute bilateral radial shaft fractures are an unusual entity that has not been previously reported in the literature. Given its bilaterality, this rare clinical entity is best treated with stable internal fixation. Here we report the case of an 18-year- old right-hand-dominant man who sustained a low-caliber gunshot injury. He had been driving with both hands on the steering wheel when he was struck by a single bullet. The bullet caused displaced fractures of the left proximal radial shaft and the right distal radial shaft. Each fracture had extension outside the mid-diaphysis. The patient underwent operative fixation with plating of the right upper extremity and intramedullary nailing on the left side. Both fractures healed, and range of motion was functional.\nDocument [15]: Title: Giant Traumatic Diaphragmatic Hernia: A Report of Delayed Presentation. Abstract: Diaphragmatic rupture is an uncommon injury after blunt abdominal trauma. The diaphragmatic defect may not be obvious in imaging studies immediately after the initial injury. Patients may have delayed presentation when the diaphragmatic defect enlarges and allows abdominal content to herniate into the thoracic cavity. Here, we present the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath at rest for two days duration. He reported having shortness of breath for the last five years, but he attributed it to his smoking. The shortness of breath was associated with cough productive and vague abdominal pain. The patient had an unremarkable relevant medical history. He reported having a motor vehicle accident five years ago that was severe but he did not sustain any significant injuries or fractures. Upon examination, the patient appeared in respiratory distress. Respiratory examination revealed diminished air entry on the left hemithorax and the abdominal examination revealed increased generalized tenderness with increased bowel sounds. The patient underwent a thoracic computed tomography scan, which unexpectedly demonstrated a huge left-sided diaphragmatic defect with bowel loops observed to occupy the left hemithorax completely. The patient was stabilized and shifted to emergency laparotomy during which the hernia content was reduced and the defect was closed with a mesh. The patient reported the resolution of his symptoms after the surgery. Intensive chest physiotherapy exercises were performed. After six months of follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no active complaints. The diaphragmatic hernia may have delayed presentations after several years of blunt abdominal trauma. The case highlighted the importance of initial imaging studies after blunt trauma may not identify the diaphragmatic defect.\nDocument [16]: Title: Acute fracture of the acetabulum secondary to a convulsive seizure 3 years after total hip arthroplasty. Abstract: While aseptic loosening, osteolysis, and infection are the most common causes of failure after total hip arthroplasty (THA), late hip pain can also be the result of acetabular fracture related to trauma and resultant prosthetic failure. However, atraumatic fracture of the acetabulum around a well-fixed acetabular component is unusual. We present a patient with an acetabular fracture resulting from a generalized convulsive attack 3 years after an uncomplicated primary THA. A 33-year-old man presented with acute left hip pain. He had chronic renal insufficiency and had undergone bilateral THA due to avascular necrosis. The night prior to his admission, he suffered a generalized convulsive attack with severe extremity contractions. Afterwards, he had acute left groin pain and had difficulty walking. Physical examination revealed moderate left hip pain as well as a 1-cm shortening of the affected limb. Radiological examination demonstrated an acetabular fracture with medial wall comminution. The acetabular component had migrated medially and rotated horizontally. Revision of the acetabular component with a reinforcement ring and implantation of a cemented acetabular component was realized. Severe muscle spasms during generalized seizures are known to lead to various musculoskeletal injuries (fractures of the proximal humerus, femur, acetabulum, and dislocation of the shoulder). Seizures could also lead to acute periprosthetic fracture of the acetabulum in patients with osteopenia. Therefore careful reaming is required to avoid overmedialization of the acetabular component in those patients.\nDocument [17]: Title: Kirschner Wire Breakage during Removal Requiring Retrieval. Abstract: Kirschner wires (K-wires) are widely used for fixation of fractures and dislocations in the hand as they are readily available, reliable, and cost-effective. Complication rates of up to 18% have been reported. However, K-wire breakage during removal is rare. We present one such case illustrating a simple technique for retrieval. A 35-year-old male presented with a distal phalanx fracture of his right middle finger. This open fracture was treated with K-wire fixation. Postoperatively, he developed a pin site infection with associated finger swelling. The K-wire broke during removal with the proximal piece completely retained in his middle phalanx. To minimise risk of osteomyelitis, the K-wire was removed with a novel surgical technique. He had full return of hand function. Intraoperative K-wire breakage has a reported rate of 0.1%. In our case, there was no obvious cause of breakage and the patient denied postoperative trauma. On the other hand, pin site infections are much more common with reported rates of up to 7% in the hand or wrist. K-wire fixation is a simple method for bony stabilisation but can be a demanding procedure with complications often overlooked. It is important to be aware of the potential sequelae.\nDocument [18]: Title: Diagnosis and treatment of a closed and inverted metacarpal head fracture. Abstract: This case report documents a rare inversion of a closed metacarpal head fracture in the setting of polytrauma. Although rare, hemispherical articular bones can fracture and rotate 180\u00b0. Because of the symmetry of the bone and the rarity of an inverted, metacarpal head fracture, a delay in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can occur, which can lead to a poor outcome. This is particularly true in the setting of polytrauma. A 38-year-old male, polytrauma patient presented to the emergency department (ED) after falling off a bridge and being struck by an oncoming vehicle. He presented with multiple surgical fractures of the upper and lower extremities as well as his pelvis. Three days after he was brought to the ED, x-rays were performed of his painful left hand, which revealed an extra-articular third metacarpal head fracture, for which he underwent open reduction of the closed fracture. Both collateral ligaments were intact and the head fragment had inverted within the constraints of these ligaments. Some of the ligament and capsular tissue remained attached to the head fragment along the radial and ulnar margins but was otherwise entirely covered with cartilage. The reduction maneuver was difficult but after the reduction was achieved, the fracture appeared stable and no internal fixation was used. Post reduction, the injury was splinted for 2 weeks and then early motion was allowed. The fracture has since healed, and the patient has attained near-full function of the finger and joint.\nDocument [19]: Title: [Avulsion injuries of the anterior inferior iliac spine among soccer players--a differential diagnosis to neoplasm decades following the trauma]. Abstract: Pelvic apophyseal injuries typically involve adolescents, ranging gradually from apophysitis as a chronic traction injury to avulsion fractures after a sudden contraction of a muscle to the immature musculo-skeleton adolescent. While avulsion fractures to the anterior superior iliac spine, the iliac crest and the pubic bone are common, injuries to the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) are only rarely encountered. We report on two 42 and 43-year old male soccer players complaining of groin pain. Both had AIIS avulsion fractures diagnosed by conventional plain x-ray of the pelvis, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. One patient had an acute adductor longus muscle injury with concomitant asymptomatic AIIS avulsion fracture. Conservative treatment of the muscle injury with initial RICE therapy followed by pain-restricted jogging brought him back to sport within four weeks. The other patient had local tenderness and exercise pain at AIIS with a large exostosis on imaging studies mimicking a pseudotumor. Surgical resection was applied and the rectus femoris muscle was reattached. After three months of intensive physical therapy he could be return to sport. Avulsion fractures of the AIIS may cause persistent pain syndrome and mimic a pseudotumor decades after the initial trauma, which can be treated by surgical resection and reattachment of the rectus femoris muscle with good results. Conservative treatment for minor dislocated AIIS avulsion fractures can be effective in sportsmen. Differential diagnosis often involves bony tumors, so patient's soccer history gives important information regarding past avulsion fractures of the pelvis, which often occur during kicking in the adolescence.\nDocument [20]: Title: Palmar dislocation of the radio-carpal joint: a case report. Abstract: Radio-carpal joint dislocation, with or without fracture of the radius, is an uncommon injury; only 21 cases have previously been reported. Successful treatments of closed reduction and surgery have also been reported. A 35-year-old right-handed man was injured in a traffic accident and taken to an emergency room of a hospital, where radiographic examination showed a right palmar radio-carpal joint dislocation. Three days after injury, the patient was transferred to our department at Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo. We performed percutaneous pin fixation to maintain the position of his reduced radio-carpal joint. Two years postoperatively, radiographic examination showed a complete union of the avulsion fracture of the radius and a reduction of the joint. He had no marked disturbance in his daily activities apart from a slight pain while working. He had no limitation on the range of motion of the wrist joint and his grip strength was 41.6 kg. He returned to work 3 months after injury.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that breathing techniques reduce short acting beta(2) agonist use and improve quality of life (QoL) in asthma. The primary aim of this double blind study was to compare the effects of breathing exercises focusing on shallow nasal breathing with those of non-specific upper body exercises on asthma symptoms, QoL, other measures of disease control, and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose. This study also assessed the effect of peak flow monitoring on outcomes in patients using breathing techniques.\nDocument [2]: Title: [Investigation of the structure breathing pattern in competitive exercises have athletes kettlebell Lifters]. Abstract: The aim of the research is to determine the breathing pattern characteristics of kettlebell athletes. The main indicators were identified: breathing frequency (f), tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation (VE). We also searched for the dependence of these parameters using the weight of kettlebells and skill of the athletes.We used the spirograph SMP-21/01-\"R-D\" for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the miain indicators of kettlebell athletes breathing patterns. Athletes who achieved Masters of Sports (MS) and candidate masters of sport (CMS), their changes in breathing during exercise occurs mainly on two parameters--the frequeincy of breathing and tidal yolume. We found out while the weight of the kettlebell increases the breathing frequen- cy increases and tidal volume decreases. Athletes who achieved International Masters of Sports (MSIC), they dominated the change of one parameter of breathing--on the tidalivolume, which increases from 0.7 +/- 0.11 to 1.2 +/- 0.11 (p < 001). In MSIC athletes tidal volume is approximately to level of 1.2 +/- 0.1, which invariably leads to an increase in breathing frequency. We discovered transition forms of breathing in competition exercises of Kettlebell sport. In our opinion high performance level of athletes is related to undergoing breathing regulation, trying constantly to keep same level of gas composition in functional residual capacity (FRC) at a time ofperforming competition exercises. This research highlights the importance of improving breathing patterns for Kettlebell athletes if they want to improve performance.\nDocument [3]: Title: Asthma - A Disease of How We Breathe: Role of Breathing Exercises and Pranayam. Abstract: To describe the role of breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama in the management of childhood asthma. We conducted an updated literature search and retrieved relevant literature on the role of breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama in the management of childhood asthma. We found that the breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama are generally multi-component packaged interventions, and are described as follows: Papworth technique, Buteyko technique, Yoga and/or Pranayam. These techniques primarily modify the pattern of breathing to reduce hyperventilation resulting in normalisation of CO2 level, reduction of bronchospasm and resulting breathlessness. In addition they also change the behaviour, decrease anxiety, improve immunological parameters, and improve endurance of the respiratory muscles that may ultimately help asthmatic children. We found 10 clinical trials conducted in children with asthma of varying severity, and found to benefit children with chronic (mild and moderate) and uncontrolled asthma, but not acute severe asthma. Breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama may benefit children with chronic (mild and moderate) and uncontrolled asthma, but not acute severe asthma. Before these techniques can be incorporated into the standard care of asthmatic children, important outcomes like quality of life, medication use, and patient reported outcomes need to be evaluated in future clinical trials.\nDocument [4]: Title: Is breath acetone a biomarker of diabetes? A historical review on breath acetone measurements. Abstract: Since the ancient discovery of the 'sweet odor' in human breath gas, pursuits of the breath analysis-based disease diagnostics have never stopped. Actually, the 'smell' of the breath, as one of three key disease diagnostic techniques, has been used in Eastern-Medicine for more than three thousand years. With advancement of measuring technologies in sensitivity and selectivity, more specific breath gas species have been identified and established as a biomarker of a particular disease. Acetone is one of the breath gases and its concentration in exhaled breath can now be determined with high accuracy using various techniques and methods. With the worldwide prevalence of diabetes that is typically diagnosed through blood testing, human desire to achieve non-blood based diabetic diagnostics and monitoring has never been quenched. Questions, such as is breath acetone a biomarker of diabetes and how is the breath acetone related to the blood glucose (BG) level (the golden criterion currently used in clinic for diabetes diagnostic, monitoring, and management), remain to be answered. A majority of current research efforts in breath acetone measurements and its technology developments focus on addressing the first question. The effort to tackle the second question has begun recently. The earliest breath acetone measurement in clearly defined diabetic patients was reported more than 60 years ago. For more than a half-century, as reviewed in this paper, there have been more than 41 independent studies of breath acetone using various techniques and methods, and more than 3211 human subjects, including 1581 healthy people, 242 Type 1 diabetic patients, 384 Type 2 diabetic patients, 174 unspecified diabetic patients, and 830 non-diabetic patients or healthy subjects who are under various physiological conditions, have been used in the studies. The results of the breath acetone measurements collected in this review support that many conditions might cause changes to breath acetone concentrations; however, the results from the six independent studies using clearly-defined Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients unanimously support that an elevated mean breath acetone concentration exists in Type 1 diabetes. Note that there is some overlap between the ranges of breath acetone concentration in individual T1D patients and healthy subjects; this reminds one to be careful when using an acetone breath test on T1D diagnostics. Comparatively, it is too early to draw a general conclusion on the relationship between a breath acetone level and a BG level from the very limited data in the literature.\nDocument [5]: Title: Breathing techniques in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Abstract: Breathing techniques are included in the rehabilitation program of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The efficacy of breathing techniques aiming at improving symptoms of dyspnea and eliciting physiological effects is discussed in this paper. In patients with COPD, breathing techniques aim to relieve symptoms and ameliorate adverse physiological effects by: 1) increasing strength and endurance of the respiratory muscles; 2) optimizing the pattern of thoracoabdominal motion; and 3) reducing dynamic hyperinflation of the rib cage and improving gas exchange. Evidence exists to support the effectiveness of pursed lips breathing, forward leaning position, active expiration and inspiratory muscle training, but not for diaphragmatic breathing. Careful patient selection, proper and repeated instruction and control of the techniques, and assessment of the effects are necessary. Despite the evidence that breathing techniques are effective, several problems need to be resolved. The limited evidence for the transfer of the effects of breathing techniques during resting conditions to exercise conditions raises several questions. Do breathing techniques have to be practiced during activities of daily living?\nDocument [6]: Title: Optimal technique for deep breathing exercises after cardiac surgery. Abstract: Cardiac surgery patients often develop a restrictive pulmonary impairment and gas exchange abnormalities in the early postoperative period. Chest physiotherapy is routinely prescribed in order to reduce or prevent these complications. Besides early mobilization, positioning and shoulder girdle exercises, various breathing exercises have been implemented as a major component of postoperative care. A variety of deep breathing maneuvres are recommended to the spontaneously breathing patient to reduce atelectasis and to improve lung function in the early postoperative period. Different breathing exercises are recommended in different parts of the world, and there is no consensus about the most effective breathing technique after cardiac surgery. Arbitrary instructions are given, and recommendations on performance and duration vary between hospitals. Deep breathing exercises are a major part of this therapy, but scientific evidence for the efficacy has been lacking until recently, and there is a lack of trials describing how postoperative breathing exercises actually should be performed. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of postoperative breathing exercises for patients undergoing cardiac surgery via sternotomy, and to discuss and suggest an optimal technique for the performance of deep breathing exercises.\nDocument [7]: Title: Patients' experiences of breathing retraining for asthma: a qualitative process analysis of participants in the intervention arms of the BREATHE trial. Abstract: Poor symptom control and impaired quality of life are common in adults with asthma, and breathing retraining exercises may be an effective method of self-management. This study aimed to explore the experiences of participants in the intervention arms of the BREATHE trial, which investigated the effectiveness of breathing retraining as a mode of asthma management. Sixteen people with asthma (11 women, 8 per group) who had taken part in the intervention arms of the BREATHE trial (breathing retraining delivered by digital versatile disc (DVD) or face-to-face sessions with a respiratory physiotherapist) took part in semi-structured telephone interviews about their experiences. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Breathing retraining was perceived positively as a method of asthma management. Motivations for taking part included being asked, to enhance progress in research, to feel better/reduce symptoms, and to reduce medication. Participants were positive about the physiotherapist, liked having the materials tailored, found meetings motivational, and liked the DVD and booklet. The impact of breathing retraining following regular practice included increased awareness of breathing and development of new habits. Benefits of breathing retraining included increased control over breathing, reduced need for medication, feeling more relaxed, and improved health and quality of life. Problems included finding time to practice the exercises, and difficulty mastering techniques. Breathing retraining was acceptable and valued by almost all participants, and many reported improved wellbeing. Face to face physiotherapy was well received. However, some participants in the DVD group mentioned being unable to master techniques.\nDocument [8]: Title: The Buteyko breathing technique for asthma: a review. Abstract: Breathing exercises and breathing retraining are often used in the management of asthma. One specific form of breathing therapy, known as the Buteyko breathing technique (BBT) has received considerable attention, but there is a paucity of rigorous research evidence to support its recommendation for asthma patients. There are only four published clinical trials and two conference abstracts evaluating BBT. Although all have reported improvements in one or more outcome measures, results have not been consistent. This article provides the background to the BBT, reviews the available evidence for its use and examines the physiological hypothesis claimed to underpin it. In common with other therapies, BBT is not a standardised treatment modality. The BBT 'package' is complex, as it also includes advice and education about medication use, nutrition and exercise, and general relaxation. This makes it difficult, and possibly inappropriate, to attempt to tease out a single mechanism. Buteyko's theory relating to carbon dioxide levels and airway calibre is an attractive one, and has some basis in evidence from experimental studies. However, it is not known whether altering breathing patterns can raise carbon dioxide levels significantly, and there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm that this is the mechanism behind any effect that BBT may exert. Further research is necessary to establish unequivocally whether BBT is effective, and if so, how it may work.\nDocument [9]: Title: The Influence of Breathing Exercises on Regional Ventilation in Healthy and Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Abstract: We hypothesized that the respiratory exercises have uniform effects on ventilation in healthy subjects but the effects varied in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, a total of 30 healthy volunteers and 9 patients with COPD were included. Data were recorded continuously during (1) diaphragmatic breathing; (2) pursed lip breathing with full inhalation; (3) pursed lip combining diaphragmatic breathing. The sequence of the three breathing exercises was randomized using machine generated random permutation. Spatial and temporal ventilation distributions were evaluated with electrical impedance tomography. Results showed that, tidal volume was significantly larger during various breathing exercises compared to quiet tidal breathing, in both healthy and COPD (<i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). However, for other EIT-based parameters, statistical significances were only observed in healthy volunteers, not in patients. Diaphragmatic breathing alone might not be able to decrease functional residual capacity in COPD and the effect varied largely from patient to patient (6:3, decrease vs. increase). Ventilation distribution moved toward ventral regions in healthy during breathing exercises (<i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). Although this trend was observed in the COPD, the differences were not significant. Ventilation became more homogeneous when diaphragmatic breathing technique was implemented (<i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). Again, the improvements were not significant in COPD. Regional ventilation delay was relatively high in COPD and comparable in various breathing periods. In conclusions, the impact of pursed lip and diaphragmatic breathing varied in different patients with COPD. Breathing exercise may need to be individualized to maximize the training efficacy with help of EIT.\nDocument [10]: Title: Influence of short breathing stop on the cardiovascular system during exercise testing. Abstract: Breathing is both a voluntary and an involuntary action, and the changes in breathing intensity or breathing stops has an influence on vegetative functions of the body during exercise. The aim of this study was to determine the possible changes in cardiovascular parameters when patients shortly stopped to breath at the beginning of exercise testing. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Two series of investigation were performed. During the first investigation, the psychomotor tonus was assessed, and the breathing frequency during exercising was monitored in the cohort of 27 healthy adult males who were recruited for the first time to be participants of exercise testing. All the participants performed the Roufier exercise test (30 squats per 45 s). A 12-lead electrocardiogram was continuously recorded during exercise and first two minutes of recovery, and arterial blood pressure was measured at each minute of experiment. During the second investigation, the influence of short breathing stop for 15 s on the changes in cardiovascular functional parameters during exercise test was evaluated. RESULTS. The results obtained during the study showed that patients who had increased psychomotor tonus stopped the breathing involuntary more frequently at the beginning of exercise testing. An involuntary or voluntary breathing stop at the beginning of exercising had an influence on the dynamics of cardiovascular parameters during exercise and recovery: heart rate increased more slowly; lesser changes in the JT interval of electrocardiogram, a trend toward an increase in the arterial blood pressure, and a significantly slower recovery of cardiovascular parameters were documented. CONCLUSION. An involuntary breathing stop caused the changes in cardiovascular parameters during exercise and recovery; therefore, functional status might be assessed not so accurately.\nDocument [11]: Title: Oxygen-enriched air reduces breathing gas consumption over air. Abstract: Owing to the unfamiliar environment, recreational and professional diving is confronted with several challenges. Usage of self-contained under-water breathing apparatuses during the dive provides the indispensable breathing gas supply for the diver. Instead of air, oxygen-enriched breathing gases (EANx or nitrox) are used with increasing frequency. Unfortunately, their usage implies negative effects because the elevated oxygen partial pressure (pO<sub>2</sub>) increases oxidative stress. As a result, the increased formation of reactive oxygen species exerts negative effects on the central nervous system, lungs, vasculature and eyes. However, these disadvantages can be avoided if appropriate rules are followed, e.g. a pO<sub>2</sub>&lt;1.4&#160;bar. EANx breathing gases have, on the other hand, major advantages as they help reducing narcotic nitrogen effects and bubble formation. Several land-based studies had proven a reduced ventilation of exercising subjects if EANx was used instead of air. As breathing gas is the most valuable under-water good, we wanted to translate the on-land results into under-water results. Appropriate studies now demonstrate a novel EANx property as under-water ventilation is also reduced with EANx. In this short communication, we present this additional advantage of EANx-breathing. This benefit seems to be of particular importance as it delays unforeseen running-out-of-gas and thus, contributes to further improving diving safety.\nDocument [12]: Title: Psychophysiological responses to various slow, deep breathing techniques. Abstract: Deep breathing exercises are commonly used for several health conditions including pain and hypertension. Various techniques are available to practice deep breathing, whereas possible differential psychophysiological effects have not been investigated. We compared four deep breathing techniques and examined outcomes in blood pressure variability, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, baroreflex function, and emotional state. Healthy adult volunteers performed pursed-lips breathing, left and right unilateral nostril breathing, and deep breathing with an inspiratory threshold load (loaded breathing), all at a frequency of 0.1 Hz (i.e., controlled breathing) and for three minutes each. Results showed that blood pressure variability was higher during loaded breathing versus other conditions and higher during pursed-lips breathing versus left and right unilateral nostril breathing. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia was higher during loaded breathing versus other conditions and higher during pursed-lips breathing versus left unilateral nostril breathing. The effect of breathing condition on respiratory sinus arrhythmia was mediated by alterations in blood pressure variability. There was no difference between the breathing conditions in baroreflex sensitivity or effectiveness. Participants rated pursed-lips breathing as more calming and pleasant and with more sense of control (vs. other conditions). Overall, among the four tested deep breathing techniques, loaded breathing was associated with enhanced cardiovascular effects and pursed-lips breathing with better emotional responses, while also enhancing cardiovascular effects (albeit less than loaded breathing). These findings can be informative in applying deep breathing techniques as self-management interventions for health conditions, in which baroreceptors stimulation and autonomic and emotional modulations can be beneficial, such as pain and hypertension.\nDocument [13]: Title: Contrasting breathing retraining and helium-oxygen during pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD: a randomized clinical trial. Abstract: Breathing-retraining and helium-oxygen (heliox) have been used to improve exercise tolerance in COPD. We hypothesized that, in patients with COPD, exercise duration after exercise-training plus breathing-retraining and oxygen would be longer than after exercise-training plus heliox or after exercise-training plus oxygen alone. We also explored the short-term maintenance of gains in exercise duration after using each technique.\nDocument [14]: Title: Vagus nerve stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy: things to note on the protocols, the effects and the mechanisms of action. Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder that is characterized by repetitive un-triggered seizures that occur severally within 24 h or more. Non-pharmacological methods for the management of epilepsy were discussed. The non-pharmacological methods include the vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) which is subdivided into invasive and non-invasive techniques. For the non-invasive techniques, the auricular VNS, stimulation of the cervical branch of vagus nerve in the neck, manual massage of the neck, and respiratory vagal nerve stimulation were discussed. Similarly, the stimulation parameters used and the mechanisms of actions through which VNS improves seizures were also discussed. Use of VNS to reduce seizure frequency has come a long way. However, considering the cost and side effects of the invasive method, non-invasive techniques should be given a renewed attention. In particular, respiratory vagal nerve stimulation should be considered. In doing this, the patients should for instance carry out slow-deep breathing exercise 6 to 8 times every 3 h during the waking hours. Slow-deep breathing can be carried out by the patients on their own; therefore this can serve as a form of self-management.HIGHLIGHTSEpilepsy can interfere with the patients' ability to carry out their daily activities and ultimately affect their quality of life.Medications are used to manage epilepsy; but they often have their serious side effects.Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is gaining ground especially in the management of refractory epilepsy.The VNS is administered through either the invasive or the non-invasive methodsThe invasive method of VNS like the medication has potential side effects, and can be costly.The non-invasive method includes auricular VNS, stimulation of the neck muscles and skin and respiratory vagal nerve stimulation via slow-deep breathing exercises.The respiratory vagal nerve stimulation via slow-deep breathing exercises seems easy to administer even by the patients themselves.Consequently, it is our opinion that patients with epilepsy be made to carry out slow-deep breathing exercise 6-8 times every 3 h during the waking hours.\nDocument [15]: Title: Influence of Respiratory Frequency of Slow-Paced Breathing on Vagally-Mediated Heart Rate Variability. Abstract: Breathing techniques, particularly slow-paced breathing (SPB), have gained popularity among athletes due to their potential to enhance performance by increasing cardiac vagal activity (CVA), which in turn can help manage stress and regulate emotions. However, it is still unclear whether the frequency of SPB affects its effectiveness in increasing CVA. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a brief SPB intervention (i.e., 5&#160;min) on CVA using heart rate variability (HRV) measurement as an index. A total of 75 athletes (22 female; M<sub>age</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;22.32; age range&#8201;=&#8201;19-31) participated in the study, attending one lab session where they performed six breathing exercises, including SPB at different frequencies (5 cycles per minute (cpm), 5.5&#160;cpm, 6&#160;cpm, 6.5&#160;cpm, 7&#160;cpm), and a control condition of spontaneous breathing. The study found that CVA was significantly higher in all SPB conditions compared to the control condition, as indexed by both root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) and low-frequency HRV (LF-HRVms<sup>2</sup>). Interestingly, LF-HRVms<sup>2</sup> was more sensitive in differentiating the respiratory frequencies than RMSSD. These results suggest that SPB at a range of 5&#160;cpm to 7&#160;cpm can be an effective method to increase CVA and potentially improve stress management and emotion regulation in athletes. This short SPB exercise can be a simple yet useful tool for athletes to use during competitive scenarios and short breaks in competitions. Overall, these findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating SPB into athletes' training and competition routines.\nDocument [16]: Title: Panoramic radiography and patients with disability: a new simple breathing technique to reduce common airspace error. Abstract: Patients with intellectual disabilities often fail to follow traditional tongue position instructions for panoramic radiographs resulting in missed pathology or unnecessary further radiation. This simple breathing technique is a new clinical instruction method for panoramic radiography developed to reduce the most common patient position error: patient failure to hold the tongue to the roof of the mouth. The technique is suitable for all patients including young patients and those with intellectual disabilities. The simple breathing technique uses 'tell-show-do' communication methods and does not mention the tongue but utilises the known tongue positions that occur during breathing and swallowing. This simple breathing technique instruction for panoramic radiography uses a demonstration of 'breathe-in, breathe-out, swallow, lips closed and hold still' to reduce the intensity of both the palatoglossal and pharyngeal airspaces on panoramic radiographs. This method, referred in this article as the simple breathing technique, can improve the diagnostic potential of panoramic radiographs and can be used with young children and patients with intellectual disabilities, and this slow breathing technique can help them further relax.\nDocument [17]: Title: Deep learning for improving ZTE MRI images in free breathing. Abstract: Despite a growing interest in lung MRI, its broader use in a clinical setting remains challenging. Several factors limit the image quality of lung MRI, such as the extremely short T2 and T2* relaxation times of the lung parenchyma and cardiac and breathing motion. Zero Echo Time (ZTE) sequences are sensitive to short T2 and T2* species paving the way to improved \"CT-like\" MR images. To overcome this limitation, a retrospective respiratory gated version of ZTE (ZTE4D) which can obtain images in 16 different respiratory phases during free breathing was developed. Initial performance of ZTE4D have shown motion artifacts. To improve image quality, deep learning with fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) has been proposed. CNNs has been widely used for MR imaging, but it has not been used for improving free-breathing lung imaging yet. Our proposed pipeline facilitates the clinical work with patients showing difficulties/uncapable to perform breath-holding, or when the different gating techniques are not efficient due to the irregular respiratory pace.\nDocument [18]: Title: Acute effects of deep breathing for a short duration (2-10 minutes) on pulmonary functions in healthy young volunteers. Abstract: Breathing is the most vital function for maintenance of life. Slow and deep breathing is an integral part of Pranayama and it reduces dead space ventilation and renews air throughout the lungs. The reported beneficial effects of deep breathing as a part of either long term or short term practice of Pranayama are well documented. However our knowledge about the effects of a few minutes' of deep breathing on human ventilatory parameters is poor. In the present study, we examined the relationship between exposure to short duration of deep breathing and performance on pulmonary function tests before and after the deep breathing. The study was conducted in a homogenous group of 12 volunteers containing 4 females and 8 males who were well trained in pulmonary function testing (PFT) before the start of the study. The volunteers performed deep breathing (DB) exercise for 2, 5 and 10 minutes at the rate of 6 breaths per minute under guidance, and the duration of DB exercise for that day was randomly selected for each group. PFT was done before and after the DB exercise. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in vital capacity (VC) after 2 and 5 minutes' DB exercise and a consistent improvement in tidal volume (TV) and minute ventilation (MV) after the DB exercise in all the three groups, though it wasn't statistically significant. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in forced vital capacity (FVC) after 2 minutes' of DB exercise and a consistent increase in all the three groups in forced inspiratory vital capacity (FIVC) and peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR), though this increase was not statistically significant. This shows that deep breathing exercise, even for a few minutes' duration is beneficial for the lung functions.\nDocument [19]: Title: Effect of breathing intervention in patients with COVID and healthcare workers. Abstract: Regulated breathing facilitates ventilation and reduces breathlessness. However, the effect of Yogic breathing on patients with COVID remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two breathing protocols, i.e., short breathing technique (SBT) and long duration breathing technique (LBDT).\nDocument [20]: Title: Reliability and reproducibility of cardiac MRI quantification of peak exercise function with long-axis views. Abstract: The conventional approach to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) involving breath holds, electrocardiography-gating, and acquisition of a short-axis (SAX) image stack, introduces technical and logistical challenges for assessing exercise left ventricular (LV) function. Real-time, free-breathing CMR acquisition of long-axis (LAX) images overcomes these issues and also enables assessment of global longitudinal strain (GLS). We evaluated the reliability of a free-breathing LAX approach compared to the standard SAX approach and the reproducibility of free-breathing LAX. LV SAX (contiguous stack) and LAX (two-chamber and four-chamber) 3T CMR cine images were acquired four times within one scan in 32 women with cardiovascular risk factors (56\u00b110 years, 28\u00b14 kg/m2) as follows: 1) resting, gated-segmented, end-expiration breath-hold; 2) resting, real-time, free-breathing; 3) test-retest set of resting, real-time, free-breathing; 4) peak exercise (incremental-to-maximum, in-magnet, stepper test), real-time, free-breathing. A second scan was performed within one week in a subset (n = 5) to determine reproducibility of peak exercise measures. Reliability and agreement of the free-breathing LAX approach with the conventional SAX approach were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. Normal control GLS reserve was also acquired in a separate set of 12 young, healthy control women (25\u00b14 years, 22\u00b12 kg/m2) for comparison. Comparisons of LV volumes and function among all techniques at rest had good-to-excellent reliability (ICC = 0.80-0.96), and excellent reliability between peak exercise free-breathing LAX and SAX evaluations (ICC = 0.92-0.96). Higher resting heart rates with free-breathing acquisitions compared to breath-hold (mean difference, limits of agreement: 5, 1-12 beats per minute) reduced reliability for cardiac output (ICC = 0.67-0.79). Reproducibility of the free-breathing LAX approach was good-to-excellent at rest and peak exercise (ICC = 0.74-0.99). GLS exercise reserve was impaired in older women at cardiovascular risk compared to young healthy women (-4.7\u00b12.3% vs -7.4\u00b12.1%, p = 0.001). Real-time, free-breathing CMR with LAX evaluation provides a reliable and reproducible method to assess rest and peak exercise cardiac function, including GLS.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Gene therapy has a great potential in cancer treatment. However, the efficacy of cancer gene therapy is currently limited by the lack of a safe and efficient means to deliver therapeutic genes into the nucleus of tumor cells. One method under investigation for improving local gene delivery is based on the use of pulsed electric field. Despite repeated demonstration of its effectiveness in vivo, the underlying mechanisms behind electric field-mediated gene delivery remain largely unknown. Without a thorough understanding of these mechanisms, it will be difficult to further advance the gene delivery. In this review, the electric field-mediated gene delivery in solid tumors will be examined by following individual transport processes that must occur in vivo for a successful gene transfer. The topics of examination include: (i) major barriers for gene delivery in the body, (ii) distribution of electric fields at both cell and tissue levels during the application of external fields, and (iii) electric field-induced transport of genes across each of the barriers. Through this approach, the review summarizes what is known about the mechanisms behind electric field-mediated gene delivery and what require further investigations in future studies.\nDocument [2]: Title: [Synthetic lethality as a functional tool in basic research and in anticancer therapy]. Abstract: Nowadays, cancer and anticancer therapy are increasingly mentioned topics. Groups of researchers keep looking for a tool that will specifically and efficiently eliminate abnormal cells without any harm for the normal ones. Such method entails the reduction of therapy's side effects, thus also improving patient's recovery. Discovery of synthetic lethality has become a new hope to create effective, personalized therapy of cancer. Researchers noted that pairs of simultaneously mutated genes can lead to cell death, whereas each gene from that pair mutated individually does not result in cell lethality. Cancer cells accumulate numerous changes in their genetic material. By defining the pairs of genes interacting in cell pathways we are able to identify a potential anticancer therapy. It is believed that such a process has evolved to create cell resistance for a single gene mutation. Proper functioning of a pathway is not dependent on a single gene. Such a solution, however, also led to the evolution of multifactorial diseases such as cancer. Research techniques using iRNA, shRNA or small molecule libraries allow us to find genes that are connected in synthetic lethality interactions. Synthetic lethality may be applied not only as an anticancer therapy but also as a tool for identifying the functions of recently recognized genes. In addition, studying synthetic lethality broadens our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing cancer cells, which should be helpful in designing highly effective personalized cancer therapies.\nDocument [3]: Title: Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis associated with anti-programmed cell death 1 therapy. Abstract: Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade has rapidly emerged as an effective therapy for a wide variety of metastatic malignancies. It has been associated with multiple immune-related adverse effects, including cutaneous eruptions. We describe two patients with clinical and histological findings that were consistent with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) after receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy for metastatic lung cancer. We successfully treated our first patient with systemic and topical steroids, photoprotection and hydroxychloroquine. However, he subsequently developed dermatomyositis after continuing PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Our second patient presented with a protracted course of a cutaneous eruption in spite of discontinuation of anti-PD-1 therapy and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and infliximab. This patient's SCLE resolved after the addition of topical steroids and photoprotection and discontinuation of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy. She and her oncology team decided to pursue non-PD-1 inhibitor treatment for lung cancer owing to a lack of tumour response. We add SCLE and dermatomyositis to the growing list of autoimmune complications of PD-1 blockade. Our cases raise a number of questions, particularly in relation to the viability of continuing anti-PD-1 therapy after developing SCLE and the role of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-associated connective tissue disease. What's already known about this topic? Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade, which is rapidly emerging as a therapy for a wide variety of metastatic malignancies, has been associated with multiple immune-related adverse effects. These include systemic autoimmune diseases such as colitis and thyroiditis in addition to numerous cutaneous adverse events. Cutaneous side-effects of PD-1 inhibitors most commonly reported in clinical trials include lichenoid reactions, eczematous dermatitis and vitiligo. What does this study add? We report two cases of PD-1 inhibitor-associated subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), with one patient progressing to dermatomyositis with continued PD-1 inhibitor treatment. In addition to being a novel cutaneous adverse event, we also demonstrate the possibility of development of multiple autoimmune diseases in one patient, which is different from classic drug-related SCLE. We discuss the treatment challenges for patients with autoimmune skin disease receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy.\nDocument [4]: Title: Lysosomal storage disease: gene therapy on both sides of the blood-brain barrier. Abstract: Most lysosomal storage disorders affect the nervous system as well as other tissues and organs of the body. Previously, the complexities of these diseases, particularly in treating neurologic abnormalities, were too great to surmount. However, based on recent developments there are realistic expectations that effective therapies are coming soon. Gene therapy offers the possibility of affordable, comprehensive treatment associated with these diseases currently not provided by standards of care. With a focus on correction of neurologic disease by systemic gene therapy of mucopolysaccharidoses types I and IIIA, we review some of the major recent advances in viral and non-viral vectors, methods of their delivery and strategies leading to correction of both the nervous and somatic tissues as well as evaluation of functional correction of neurologic manifestations in animal models. We discuss two questions: what systemic gene therapy strategies work best for correction of both somatic and neurologic abnormalities in a lysosomal storage disorder and is there evidence that targeting peripheral tissues (e.g., in the liver) has a future for ameliorating neurologic disease in patients?\nDocument [5]: Title: Pharmacokinetic considerations regarding non-viral cancer gene therapy. Abstract: Cancer gene therapy, in which pharmacologically active compounds are administered to cancer patients in a genetic form, has been examined not only in animals but also in cancer patients. Viral vector-induced severe side effects in patients have greatly underscored the importance of non-viral gene transfer methods. Even though the importance of pharmacokinetics is undoubtedly understood in the development of anticancer therapies, its importance has been less well recognized in non-viral cancer gene therapy. When transgene products express their activity within transduced cells, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase and short hairpin RNA, the pharmacokinetics of the vectors and the expression profiles of the transgenes will determine the efficacy of gene transfer. The percentage of cells transduced is highly important if few by-stander effects are expected. If transgene products are secreted from cells into the blood circulation, such as interferons and interleukins, the pharmacokinetics of transgenes becomes a matter of significant importance. Then, any approach to increasing the level and duration of transgene expression will increase the therapeutic effects of cancer gene therapy. Here we review the pharmacokinetics of both non-viral vectors and transgene products, and discuss what should be done to achieve safer and more effective non-viral cancer gene therapy.\nDocument [6]: Title: Current Status of Gene Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths world-wide. Liver transplantation, surgical resection, trans-arterial chemoembolization, and radio frequency ablation are effective strategies to treat early stage HCC. Unfortunately, HCC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and there are not many treatment options for late stage HCC. First-line therapy for late stage HCC includes sorafenib and lenvatinib. However, these treatments provide only an approximate three month increase in survival. Besides, they cannot specifically target cancer cells that lead to a wide array of side effects. Patients on these drugs develop resistance within a few months and have to rely on second-line therapy that includes regorafenib, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and cabometyx. These disadvantages make gene therapy approach to treat HCC an attractive option. The two important questions that researchers have been trying to answer in the last 2-3 decades are what genes should be targeted and what delivery systems should be used. The objective of this review is to analyze the changing landscape of HCC gene therapy, with a focus on these two questions.\nDocument [7]: Title: Educational avenues for promoting dialog on fascia. Abstract: If your healthcare professional students have not heard about the importance of fascia they definitely should, and if your residents have not heard about the manifestations of fascia health they definitely will from their patients. While fascia may not be the sexiest of organ systems, it is one of the most influential. Fascia is gaining interest from researchers, physicians, and many subdivisions of manual medicine including massage therapists. The fascial system is now being recognized with roles in pathology, fluid movement, and proprioception. It is also important in skeletal muscle movement, perception of pain, protein regulation and expression, cell signaling, neoplastic growth, and hormone distribution in our body. It can be the reason why we feel chronic pain or why we feel tightness after physical activity. The primary responsibility of fascia is to connect systems so that the body works as a whole, which is what permits this topic to be easily embedded anywhere in our health curricula. Whether you teach students in schools of medical, veterinary, dental, physical therapy, physician assistant studies, or occupational therapy, fascia matters. Whether you teach in an integrated curriculum or a curriculum that is designed for problem-based learning or a classical discipline-based curriculum, connective tissue has a place in academia. So, in our cramped curriculum how do we make sure that our current undergraduate and graduate students understand the complexity of fascia without adding additional time to coursework? To answer this question, this article demonstrates how fascia can fit anywhere in the curriculum because it is found everywhere. Clin. Anat. 32:871-876, 2019. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nDocument [8]: Title: Positron emission tomography and gene therapy: basic concepts and experimental approaches for in vivo gene expression imaging. Abstract: More than two decades of intense research have allowed gene therapy to move from the laboratory to the clinical setting, where its use for the treatment of human pathologies has been considerably increased in the last years. However, many crucial questions remain to be solved in this challenging field. In vivo imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) by combination of the appropriate PET reporter gene and PET reporter probe could provide invaluable qualitative and quantitative information to answer multiple unsolved questions about gene therapy. PET imaging could be used to define parameters not available by other techniques that are of substantial interest not only for the proper understanding of the gene therapy process, but also for its future development and clinical application in humans. This review focuses on the molecular biology basis of gene therapy and molecular imaging, describing the fundamentals of in vivo gene expression imaging by PET, and the application of PET to gene therapy, as a technology that can be used in many different ways. It could be applied to avoid invasive procedures for gene therapy monitoring; accurately diagnose the pathology for better planning of the most adequate therapeutic approach; as treatment evaluation to image the functional effects of gene therapy at the biochemical level; as a quantitative noninvasive way to monitor the location, magnitude and persistence of gene expression over time; and would also help to a better understanding of vector biology and pharmacology devoted to the development of safer and more efficient vectors.\nDocument [9]: Title: Survey of genetic counselors identifies a knowledge gap discerning properly regulated cell and gene therapy trials. Abstract: As cell and gene therapy (CGT) has grown in availability and scope, more unapproved regenerative medicine is being marketed to the public. It is essential that health care providers have sufficient knowledge and comfort to determine whether treatments are properly regulated and address these topics with patients. Due to the applicability of CGT to genetic disease, genetic counselors could be key in providing education and answering patients' questions about these topics. However, previous studies have focused only on physicians' knowledge and comfort with CGT and unapproved regenerative medicine. The purpose of this study was to assess genetic counselors' self-reported knowledge and comfort discussing these topics with patients and to explore what factors predict increased knowledge and comfort.\nDocument [10]: Title: A Brief Introduction to Current Cancer Gene Therapy. Abstract: Gene therapy has started in the late 1980s as novel, clinically applicable therapeutic option. It revolutionized the treatment of genetic diseases with the initial intent to repair or replace defective genes. Gene therapy has been adapted for treatment of malignant diseases to improve the outcome of cancer patients. In fact, cancer gene therapy has rapidly gained great interest and evolved into a research field with highest proportion of research activities in gene therapy. In this context, cancer gene therapy has long entered translation into clinical trials and therefore more than two-thirds of all gene therapy trials worldwide are aiming at the treatment of cancer disease using different therapeutic strategies. During the decades in cancer gene therapy, tremendous knowledge has accumulated. This led to significant improvements in vector design, transgene repertoire, more targeted interventions, use of novel gene therapeutic technologies such as CRISPR/Cas, sleeping beauty vectors, and development of effective cancer immunogene therapies. In this chapter, a brief overview of current key developments in cancer gene therapy is provided to gain insights into the recent directions in research as well as in clinical application of cancer gene therapy.\nDocument [11]: Title: Topical colchicine selection of keratinocytes transduced with the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) can sustain and enhance transgene expression in vivo. Abstract: In gene therapy, a clinically relevant therapeutic effect requires long-term expression of the desired gene at a level sufficient to correct or at least alleviate the underlying gene defect. One approach to achieve persistent as well as high-level transgene expression in a significant percentage of target cells would be to select cells expressing both the desired transgene and a linked selectable gene--such as the human multi-drug resistance (MDR1) gene--in a bicistronic vector. Because of its accessibility, the skin is a very attractive target tissue to select genetically modified cells, allowing topical application of a selecting agent, thus minimizing potential toxic side effects. Among the potential selecting drugs, agents that block cell division, such as colchicine, are of particular interest because the use of anti-mitotic drugs takes advantage of the rapid keratinocyte (KC) turnover in the epidermis and the need for continued proliferation to substitute the KC lost due to selection. Before assessing the therapeutic benefit of such an approach, several key questions need to be answered in preclinical models: (1) Does topical colchicine application achieve the desired in vivo effect by blocking KC mitosis without eliciting unwanted toxic side effects? (2) Are MDR-transduced (MDR+) human KC still able to proliferate and differentiate when treated with colchicine? (3) Can MDR+ KC be enriched by topical selection? (4) Does topical selection result in persistent transgene expression by selecting KC stem cells expressing MDR? To answer these questions and to test the feasibility of such an approach both an in vitro skin equivalent and an in vivo human skin graft model were developed in which MDR+ KC were treated with different dosages of colchicine. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of MDR expression in human KC showed that topical colchicine treatment selects high-level transgene expression in a high percentage of KC. Moreover, determination of transgene copy numbers demonstrated that MDR+ KC progenitor cells were enriched by topical selection resulting in long-term expression of the transgene in the skin. Thus, in summary, these models demonstrate that topical selection of MDR+ KC is a safe approach to efficiently enhance long-term gene expression in the skin and holds future promise for clinical gene therapy applications.\nDocument [12]: Title: Ocular Gene Therapy: A Literature Review with Special Focus on Immune and Inflammatory Responses. Abstract: Gene therapy has emerged as a research topic of choice in recent years. The eye in particular is one of few organs of the body for which gene therapy has received Food and Drug Administration approval, and it remains a field of great interest for gene therapy development. However, its associated immune and inflammatory reactions may render the treatment ineffective or harmful, which are of particular concern for the eyes due to their susceptibility to inflammation. The severity of immune and inflammatory reactions depends on the choice of vector and its route of administration. Furthermore, most preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the dose of vectors is correlated with the degree of humoral response and ocular inflammation. The route of administration directly impacts the degree of immune and inflammatory reaction. Subretinal delivery produces a weaker humoral response than the intravitreal route. However, some studies have demonstrated that the subretinal delivery induces a stronger inflammatory reaction. On the other hand, several instances of vision loss due to severe late onset intraocular inflammation were reported in a clinical trial involving intravitreal delivery of viral vectors. When compared with the intravitreal route, suprachoroidal gene delivery has been shown to produce weaker humoral response. However, unlike the subretinal space, the suprachoroidal space is not known to have immune privilege status. Inflammatory reactions following ocular gene therapy are typically mild and most clinical and preclinical studies have shown that they can be controlled with topical, local or systemic steroids. However, severe inflammatory responses may occur and require aggressive management to avoid permanent vision loss. Further investigations are required to elucidate and expand our knowledge of inflammatory reactions, and their optimal management, following ocular gene therapy.\nDocument [13]: Title: Melatonin in Chemo/Radiation Therapy; Implications for Normal Tissues Sparing and Tumor Suppression: An Updated Review. Abstract: Resistance to therapy and the toxicity of normal tissue are the major problems for efficacy associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Drug resistance is responsible for most cases of mortality associated with cancer. Furthermore, their side effects can decrease the quality of life for surviving patients. An enhancement in the tumor response to therapy and alleviation of toxic effects remain unsolved challenges. One of the interesting topics is the administration of agents with low toxicity to protect normal tissues and/or sensitize cancers to chemo/radiotherapy. Melatonin is a natural body hormone that is known as a multitasking molecule. Although it has antioxidant properties, a large number of experiments have uncovered interesting effects of melatonin that can increase the therapeutic efficacy of chemo/radiation therapy. Melatonin can enhance anticancer therapy efficacy through various mechanisms, cells such as the immune system, and modulation of cell cycle and death pathways, tumor suppressor genes, and also through suppression of some drug resistance mediators. However, melatonin may protect normal tissues through the suppression of inflammation, fibrosis, and massive oxidative stress in normal cells and tissues. In this review, we will discuss the distinct effects of melatonin on both tumors and normal tissues. We review how melatonin may enhance radio/chemosensitivity of tumors while protecting normal tissues such as the lung, heart, gastrointestinal system, reproductive system, brain, liver, and kidney.\nDocument [14]: Title: CRISPR-Cas9, A Promising Therapeutic Tool for Cancer Therapy: A Review. Abstract: Cancer is one of the most leading causes of mortality all over the world and remains a foremost social and economic burden. Mutations in the genome of individuals are taking place more frequently due to the excessive progress of xenobiotics and industrialization in the present world. With the progress in the field of molecular biology, it is possible to alter the genome and to observe the functional changes derived from genetic modulation using gene-editing technologies. Several therapies have been applied for the treatment of malignancy which affect the normal body cells; however, more effort is required to develop vsome latest therapeutic approaches for cancer biology and oncology exploiting these molecular biology advances. Recently, the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has emerged as a powerful technology for cancer therapy because of its great accuracy and efficiency. Genome editing technologies have demonstrated a plethora of benefits to the biological sciences. CRISPR- Cas9, a versatile gene editing tool, has become a robust strategy for making alterations to the genome of organisms and a potent weapon in the arsenal of tumor treatment. It has revealed an excellent clinical potential for cancer therapy by discovering novel targets and has provided the researchers with the perception about how tumors respond to drug therapy. Stern efforts are in progress to enhance its efficiency of sequence specific targeting and consequently repressing offtarget effects. CRISPR-Cas9 uses specific proteins to convalesce mutations at genetic level. In CRISPR-Cas9 system, RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease harnesses gene mutation, DNA deletion or insertion, transcriptional activation or repression, multiplex targeting only by manipulating 20-nucleotide components of RNA. Originally, CRISPR-Cas9 system was used by bacteria for their defense against different bacteriophages, and recently this system is receiving noteworthy appreciation due to its emerging role in the treatment of genetic disorders and carcinogenesis. CRISPR-Cas9 can be employed to promptly engineer oncolytic viruses and immune cells for cancer therapeutic applications. More notably, it has the ability to precisely edit genes not only in model organisms but also in human being that permits its use in therapeutic analysis. It also plays a significant role in the development of complete genomic libraries for cancer patients. In this review, we have highlighted the involvement of CRISPR-Cas9 system in cancer therapy accompanied by its prospective applications in various types of malignancy and cancer biology. In addition, some other conspicuous functions of this unique system have also been discussed beyond genome editing.\nDocument [15]: Title: Optimization of peptide-plasmid DNA vectors formulation for gene delivery in cancer therapy exploring design of experiments. Abstract: The field of gene therapy still attracts great interest due to its potential therapeutic effect towards the most deadly diseases, such as cancer. For cancer gene therapy to be feasible and viable in a clinical setting, the design and development of a suitable gene delivery system is imperative. Peptide based vectors, in particular, reveal to be promising for therapeutic gene release. Following this, two different peptides, RALA and WRAP5, have been investigated mainly regarding their ability to form complexes with a p53 encoding plasmid (pDNA) with suitable properties for gene delivery. To address this issue, and after an initial screening study focused on the dependence of pDNA complexation capacity with the nitrogen to phosphate groups (N/P) ratio, a design of experiments (DoE) tool has been employed. For each peptide/pDNA system, parameters such as, the buffer pH and the N/P ratio were considered the DoE inputs and the vector size, zeta potential and pDNA complexation capacity (CC) were monitored as DoE outputs. The main goal was to find the optimal experimental conditions to minimize particle sizes, as well as, to maximize the positive surface charges of the formulated nanosystems and maximize the pDNA CC. Through the DoE method applied, the optimal RALA/pDNA and WRAP5/pDNA formulations were revealed and show interesting features related to peptide structure and pDNA complexation ability. This work illustrates the great utility of experimental design tools in optimizing the formulation of peptide/pDNA vectors in a minimum number of experiments providing relevant knowledge for the development of more suitable and efficient gene delivery systems. The new insights achieved on these carriers clearly instigate deeper research on gene therapy.\nDocument [16]: Title: Development of Gene Therapeutics for Head and Neck Cancer in China: From Bench to Bedside. Abstract: Head and neck cancer represents the seventh most common cancer worldwide. Although multidisciplinary sequential treatments have been used, there is still an urgent need for new treatment approaches that can effectively improve the outcomes of patients with advanced stages of head and neck cancer. Gene therapy is a rapidly evolving field in cancer therapy that has been shown to improve the efficacy of antitumor treatment. China is at the forefront in clinical trials and practice of gene therapy. Chinese researchers have mainly focused on gene therapeutics based on oncolytic virus and recombinant adenovirus expressing p53, antiangiogenesis factor or herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase. Currently, two gene therapy drugs, Gendicine and Oncorine, have been marketed in China, and a number of upcoming gene therapy agents are under development for the treatment of head and neck cancer. Most gene therapy agents have demonstrated excellent tolerance. However, the therapeutic effects need further improvement. With current innovations in tumor biology and knowledge, gene therapy has great potential as a safe and effective anticancer treatment. In recent years, new gene therapy agents with promising effects have been incorporated into clinical trials in China. Thus, gene therapy may become an important part of anticancer therapy and is expected to improve the therapeutic effect of head and neck cancers in the near future.\nDocument [17]: Title: Novel drug delivery strategies and gene therapy regimen as a promising perspective for management of psoriasis. Abstract: Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder; however, an exact underlying mechanism responsible for psoriasis is yet not known. A hypothesis put forward is an abnormal proliferation of keratinocytes due to faulty signals brought about by T-cells. Due to the lack of evidence of the exact cause, a variety of treatments have been used of which topical therapy is usually the first option in most patients. Topical therapy has several shortcomings and barriers of drug delivary which may be effectively overcome using novel drug carrier systems which exhibit maximum penetration, controlled release, reduced irritancy and, overall, a better efficacy. Thus, novel treatment strategies based on gene therapy such as antisensing nucleotide, silencing RNA complex, stem cell therapy and antibody-based therapy are being envisaged. This review article discusses the concepts and background of current novel delivery systems and gene therapy tools for effective management of psoriasis.\nDocument [18]: Title: [Touching cancer: shiatsu as complementary treatment to support cancer patients]. Abstract: In recent years there has been an increase in the interest of cancer patients in receiving complementary medicine therapies as supportive measures to cure the disease. In response, medical units that combine conventional and complementary medicine (integrative medicine) have been established in leading cancer centers worldwide. In Israel, a special integrative medicine unit that combines mind-body, Chinese medicine, nutrition, herbs, supplements, and manual therapies (such as shiatsu) before, during and after conventional anti-cancer therapies has been established as an integral part of the Davidoff Comprehensive Cancer Center in 2006. Shiatsu represents a group of manual therapeutic techniques, including acupressure. Shiatsu offers cancer patients a non-pharmacologic method to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life throughout the course of illness. Research indicates that acupressure is relatively effective and safe for common cancer-related symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and insomnia. In our experience, shiatsu is also relatively effective and safe for other common symptoms such as fatigue, muscular pain and body image dissatisfaction. Yet, insufficient evidence exists to delineate the best means by which shiatsu and other manual therapies could or should be integrated into routine cancer care. The purpose of the present paper is to describe what is currently known about this topic in order to support decision-making that is based on facts, rather than on myths and misconceptions. We call for more research that examines the effectiveness and safety of shiatsu and other manual therapies in the care of cancer patients.\nDocument [19]: Title: Improving adenoviral vectors and strategies for prostate cancer gene therapy. Abstract: Gene therapy has been evaluated for the treatment of prostate cancer and includes the application of adenoviral vectors encoding a suicide gene or oncolytic adenoviruses that may be armed with a functional transgene. In parallel, versions of adenoviral vector expressing the p53 gene (Ad-p53) have been tested as treatments for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Although Ad-p53 gene therapy has yielded some interesting results when applied to prostate cancer, it has not been widely explored, perhaps due to current limitations of the approach. To achieve better functionality, improvements in the gene transfer system and the therapeutic regimen may be required. We have developed adenoviral vectors whose transgene expression is controlled by a p53-responsive promoter, which creates a positive feedback mechanism when used to drive the expression of p53. Together with improvements that permit efficient transduction, this new approach was more effective than the use of traditional versions of Ad-p53 in killing prostate cancer cell lines and inhibiting tumor progression. Even so, gene therapy is not expected to replace traditional chemotherapy but should complement the standard of care. In fact, chemotherapy has been shown to assist in viral transduction and transgene expression. The cooperation between gene therapy and chemotherapy is expected to effectively kill tumor cells while permitting the use of reduced chemotherapy drug concentrations and, thus, lowering side effects. Therefore, the combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy may prove essential for the success of both approaches.\nDocument [20]: Title: Unique risk factors for insertional mutagenesis in a mouse model of XSCID gene therapy. Abstract: Although gene therapy can cure patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) syndromes, the clinical occurrence of T cell malignancies due to insertional mutagenesis has raised concerns about the safety of gene therapy. Several key questions have remained unanswered: (i) are there unique risk factors for X-linked SCID (XSCID) gene therapy that increase the risk of insertional mutagenesis; (ii) what other genetic lesions may contribute to transformation; and (iii) what systems can be used to test different vectors for their relative safety? To address these questions, we have developed an XSCID mouse model in which both the Arf tumor-suppressor gene and the gammac gene were ablated. Gene therapy in this animal model recapitulates the high incidence of integration-dependent, T cell tumors that was seen in the clinical trial. Ligation-mediated PCR analysis showed integration sites near or within established protooncogenes (Chd9, Slamf6, Tde1, Camk2b, and Ly6e), demonstrating that T cell transformation was associated with targeting of oncogene loci; however, no integrations within the Lmo2 locus were identified. The X-SCID background in transplanted cells was required for high rate transformation and was associated with expansion of primitive hematopoietic cells that may serve tumor precursors. This model should be useful for testing safety-modified vectors and for further exploring the risk factors leading to insertional mutagenesis in gene therapy trials.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) of the trigeminal nerve are uncommon lesions that pose a surgical challenge to neurosurgeons. The case described in this video involved a 67-yr-old man who presented with a 2-yr history of left-sided facial numbness spreading from his chin along the left mandible to the preauricular area. He also reported left-sided tongue numbness and decreased taste on the left side of the tongue. On examination, he had left-sided facial numbness along the V3 distribution to pinprick and light touch. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhancing left V3 lesion extending from Meckel's cave to the angle of the mandible. The patient underwent a left temporal craniotomy for biopsy of the lesion, formalizing the diagnosis of a MPNST of the left trigeminal nerve. A multidisciplinary resection of his lesion was performed. Left infratemporal fossa approach with neck dissection, mandibulectomy, and frontotemporal craniotomy were performed. Additionally, a frontal external ventricular drain was placed for 3 d to aid in CSF diversion to avoid CSF leak, and free-flap reconstruction was undertaken. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Postoperatively, he retained his facial numbness, dysphagia, and dysarthria. The patient was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation on postoperative day 12. Postoperative computed tomography and MRI depicted complete resection of the left trigeminal nerve MPNST. At his last follow-up appointment, 3 mo after surgery, the patient reported significant improvement in his symptoms. Neuroimaging demonstrated no residual tumor and adjuvant radiotherapy was recommended. The patient provided consent for publication.\nDocument [2]: Title: Facial numbness in a man with inguinal and retroperitoneal masses. Abstract: A 37-year-old Brazilian man was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital for evaluation of left-sided facial numbness, left-sided ataxia, dizziness, and vertigo. Seven weeks prior to admission, he reported numbness of the left oral cavity and tongue after a dental procedure. Three weeks prior to presentation, he developed left-sided incoordination with dizziness and vertigo. One week later, he noticed difficulty using a box cutter at work and presented to the emergency department for evaluation. A CT scan without contrast revealed no abnormalities and he was discharged home. Three days prior to admission, the patient developed diplopia. Cranial MRI revealed a 1.6 cm irregular enhancing mass in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. Neurologic examination was significant for diminished sensation over the left face to pinprick, left-sided dysmetria, and mild lateral instability of the trunk while walking.\nDocument [3]: Title: Retrosigmoid Approach for Resection of Cerebellopontine Angle Meningioma. Abstract: This video depicts the case of an 81-year-old man who presented with a 3-month history of left-sided facial numbness and gait imbalance. On examination, he had gait ataxia and decreased left facial sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large homogenously enhancing lesion arising from the inferior surface of the tentorium toward the left cerebellopontine angle causing significant brainstem compression ( Fig. 1A and 1B ). The differential diagnoses for this lesion included meningioma and trigeminal nerve schwannoma. Given the patient's symptoms, the size of the lesion, and the severity of brainstem compression, surgical resection was recommended. The patient underwent a left retrosigmoid craniotomy for resection of the mass ( Fig. 2 ). The patient tolerated the procedure well with no new postoperative neurological deficit. Histopathological examination of the lesion revealed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma. Postoperative MRI was consistent with gross total resection of the tumor ( Fig. 1C and 1D ). The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4. At his last follow-up appointment, 1 month after surgery, the patient reported complete resolution of his imbalance and left-sided facial numbness. The patient gave consent for publication.

Abstract: A 21-year-old man presented with a recent onset history of tingling and numbness of his left upper limb. He also had a 3 year history of anhydrosis affecting the left half of his face and left upper limb. Clinical and Doppler assessment did not reveal any vascular cause for his symptoms. However, a chest roentgenogram revealed a smooth mediastinal-based shadow in the left upper zone. Further imaging revealed a well-rounded left upper paravertebral tumour with cystic areas. There was no evidence of intraspinal extension. He underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) excision of the tumour. Following this, he made an uneventful recovery.\nDocument [5]: Title: Atrial myxoma presenting as acute ischaemic stroke and chronic right lower leg claudication. Abstract: A 48-year-old man presented with acute onset of left facial numbness, ataxic gait and double vision. He also complained of chronic right lower leg pain with acute onset a year prior to presentation. His vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam was notable for right-sided intranuclear opthalmoplegia, decreased sensation to light touch on the left side of his body, left-sided dysmetria and ataxic gait. Neuroimaging showed evidence of acute stroke in the cerebellum and brainstem, for which he was treated with thrombolytics. An echocardiogram revealed a 5\u00d73 cm left atrial myxoma, which was surgically resected. Subsequent imaging of his lower extremity revealed a chronic common iliac artery occlusion for which he underwent angioplasty. His claudication symptoms resolved, and he was without any neurological deficits at a 2-year follow-up visit.\nDocument [6]: Title: Isolated double herpes zoster paresis involving the left facial nerve and the right peroneal nerve following disseminated herpes zoster. Abstract: A 72-year-old Japanese male developed disseminated herpes zoster and could not easily walk due to right drop foot and pain. He soon developed numbness and pain on the left side of his face, and noticed difficulty closing his left eye. The left angle of his mouth dropped. The patient was diagnosed as having a double mononeuropathy (a left facial nerve paresis and a right peroneal nerve paresis) following disseminated herpes zoster. Given that the patient was elderly and had diabetes mellitus, the patient appeared to be an immunocompromised host. We also describe other rare complications of herpes zoster from the published work.\nDocument [7]: Title: Retrieval of an Intracranially Migrated Dental Injection Needle Through the Foramen Ovale: 2-Dimensional Operative Video. Abstract: Dental injection needle migration is a rare complication of orthodontal procedures. When these needles fracture, they typically dislodge into the cervical space or the facial musculature. Migration into the cranial vault is difficult because of the obstacle created by the skull base. We report a rare case of intracranial migration of an anesthetic injection needle through the foramen ovale. A 59-yr-old man underwent the extraction of a right maxillary molar. The distal end of a 25-gauge injection needle broke into his pterygoid musculature, causing him pain while chewing. Vascular imaging obtained after a computed tomography scan of his face showed that the needle had migrated, potentially because of his efforts of mastication, and had traversed the foramen ovale into the middle cranial fossa. The patient started experiencing intermittent right facial numbness, likely due to compression or injury to the right trigeminal nerve. Our oral and maxillofacial colleagues did not believe that the needle could be retrieved from its facial end. The patient elected to undergo the recovery of the needle through a craniotomy given the fact that the object was contaminated and because he was becoming increasingly symptomatic. A right pterional craniotomy was planned. Extradural dissection was performed until the dura going into the foramen ovale was revealed. We could feel the metallic needle under the dural sheath of the trigeminal nerve. The dura was opened sharply directly over the needle. We then proceeded to mobilize the needle into the face, and then pulled it out completely through the craniotomy to avoid injury to the temporal lobe. The patient recovered well and was asymptomatic at the time of discharge. This case report was written in compliance with our institutional ethical review board. Institutional review board (IRB) approval and patient consent were waived in light of the retrospective and deidentified nature of the data presented in accordance with the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) IRB.\nDocument [8]: Title: Community-acquired left-sided Pseudomonas aeruginosa endocarditis in a patient without intravenous drug use.

He was treated successfully with valvular surgery, along with combination antibiotics.\nDocument [9]: Title: Lower Motor Neuron Facial Palsy Due to Facial Colliculus Syndrome. Abstract: In patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset facial asymmetry, decision for disposition is usually based on whether it is an upper (UMN) or lower motor neuron (LMN) cranial nerve 7<sup>th</sup> (CN7) palsy. In my institution, patients with UMN CN7 palsy would require admission for further investigations to look for central causes.&#160;Those who have an isolated LMN facial nerve palsy can be managed as outpatients. A 36-year-old gentleman presented to the ED with acute vertigo and right facial weakness.&#160;He had no known cardiac risk factors.&#160;His vital signs on presentation were: Temperature 36.6&#8451;, blood pressure 142/68mmHg, pulse rate 92/min, and oxygen saturation level (SpO2) 100% on room air.&#160;Initial neurological examination revealed a right LMN CN7 palsy without any other cranial nerve, cerebellar, or pyramidal deficits.&#160;He was given symptomatic treatment for vertigo without relief.&#160;Repeat examination subsequently showed a right conjugate gaze palsy with gaze-evoked nystagmus.&#160;There was no limb weakness or numbness.&#160;Gait was noted to be unsteady with a broad-based stance and truncal ataxia.&#160;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain subsequently showed an infarct affecting the right facial colliculus in the dorsal pons. In my department, this was the first case of a young patient with a stroke presenting with LMN CN7 palsy. He was initially treated for a possible peripheral cause of his vertigo as he had a history of vestibular neuronitis, but without symptomatic improvement.&#160;Patients with neurological symptoms (e.g. vertigo) not resolving with initial treatment should prompt consideration for&#160;repeat neurological examination because the patient may have evolving neurological signs, as well as&#160;consider the potential for initial anchoring/cognitive bias.&#160;In this case,&#160;the gaze palsy and cerebellar signs were only noted on subsequent examination.&#160;Presence of LMN CN7 palsy with other associated neurological signs (including other cranial nerve palsies) would warrant further imaging to look for more sinister intracranial causes, including cerebral infarcts or space-occupying lesions.&#160; This case serves to remind medical practitioners to strongly consider a central cause (e.g. stroke) for patients presenting with an LMN facial palsy, even in young patients in the absence of other vascular risk factors, especially when other neurological symptoms and signs are present.\nDocument [10]: Title: A clinician guide to patients afraid of dental injections and numbness. Abstract: Fears of dental injections remain a clinical problem often requiring cognitive behavioural psychology counselling and sedation in order to carry out needed dental treatment. This study, based on a national survey in Australia, compared patient concerns about numbness caused by local anaesthesia and fears of the injection itself. It also examined associations between dental fearfulness and avoidance associated with patient self-reported negative experiences and treatment need. Clinical advice on how to approach such patients is offered. Relatively high levels of dental anxiety and fear have been reported in several industrialised Western societies (McGrath & Bedi, 2004; Armfield, Spencer & Stewart, 2006; Lahti et al., 2007; Enkling, Marwinski J\u00f6hren, 2006). In the U.K., almost one in three adults consider themselves to always be anxious about going to the dentist (Nuttall et al., 2001). Of concern is that this dental fear may be passed on to the children of anxious adults (Nuttall, Gilbert & Morris, 2008), leading to an inter-generational perpetuation of the problem. There is considerable evidence that dental fear is related to poorer oral health, reduced dental attendance and increased treatment stress for the attending dentist. There are many aspects of going to a dentist that might elicit feelings of apprehension, concern or anxiety in prospective patients (Liddell & Gosse, 1998; Oosterink, de Jongh & Aartman, 2008). One of the most commonly reported concerns relates to receiving injections. Indeed, fear of needles and the treatment of injection fear has been an important focus of a research in the U.K. (Boyle, Newton & Milgrom, 2010). Needle fear, in particular, is a major issue given that the delivery of local anaesthesia via injection is the central plank of pain relief techniques in dentistry (Malamed, 2009) and dentists as well as patients often avoid difficult injections as a consequence, resulting in poor pain control. A less well described anxiety of receiving dental treatment is fear of numbness associated with the dental injection (Morse & Cohen, 1983). Certainly, many dentists believe that their patients avoid local anaesthesia because of a wish to avoid the disturbing effects of numbness (Moore et al., 1998). Milgrom et al. (1997) found that fears about the numbness associated with receiving local anaesthesia significantly differentiated avoiders and non-avoiders of dental treatment. However, these concerns appeared to be much less common than those concerning the perceived pain of injections and fear of bodily injury resulting from the injection (Milgrom et al., 1997; Kaako et al., 1998). Consistent with these findings, whereas 43% of English patients asked to imagine undergoing future third molar surgery expressed concerns primarily about pain, only 6% of patients indicated concern about numbness as their worst fear (Earl, 1994). More recently, a study of Dutch people found that the feeling of numbness from the anaesthesia was rated as the 41st most feared dental stimulus out of a list of 67 possible stimuli, and that only 1.5% of the general population regarded numbness as extremely anxiety provoking (Oosterink, de Jongh & Aartman, 2008). However, it is important for\nDocument [11]: Title: Weakness with left elbow flexion \u00b7 left anterior shoulder pain \u00b7 Dx? Abstract: A 41-year-old, right-hand dominant man sought care at our facility one day after trying to pull his boat out of the water. He'd tried to lift the boat with his hands while his forearms were fully supinated and his elbows were flexed to about 90 degrees. He then felt a sharp burning sensation in his left anterior shoulder and was unable to lift the boat. The patient denied feeling a popping sensation at the time of the injury. He had mild pain at night, but was able to sleep. He said that he had mild diminished strength with elbow flexion, but denied having any numbness, tingling, or discoloration of his skin.\nDocument [12]: Title: Telehealth and Physical Therapy Clinical Decision Making in a Patient with a Falcine Meningioma. Abstract: Telehealth utilizes information technologies and communication networks to deliver healthcare and education with lower costs and improved access, quality, and efficiency of healthcare services. This report describes the application of telehealth for medical screening, clinical decision making, and medical referral in a physical therapy practice. The patient described was a 50-year old man who contacted his physical therapist via telephone for a chief complaint of worsening left sided numbness and tingling that began insidiously 2 days prior. Further questioning revealed that the patient also complained of left ankle weakness, and slight unsteadiness with walking. He had not been feeling well and had been experiencing increasing bouts of unexplained fatigue over the previous two months that were now interfering with his work and recreational activities. The patient was evaluated by his physician the next day. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a large (4 cm) falcine meningioma in the right parietal region. The patient was immediately referred to a neurosurgeon and underwent a craniotomy and tumor resection ten days later and subsequent gamma knife radiosurgery of the residual tumor bed two months after craniotomy and tumor resection. Follow-up imaging one year later revealed no evidence of recurrence or residual tumor. This patient case underscores the importance of recognizing signs and symptoms of serious disease, and how referral following telehealth via telephone can inform diagnosis.\nDocument [13]: Title: Bilateral facial synkinesis in leprosy. Abstract: Leprosy is an important cause of cranial nerve palsy in endemic areas where it may be seen in upto 17.6% patients. The authors herein describe a rare case of bilaterally symmetrical facial synkinesis with video documentation and modified blink reflex. A 35-year-old gentleman presented with numbness involving right half of his face for 8 months and abnormal stretching sensations over both sides of his nose for one and a half months. Sensory and motor involvement of the right trigeminal nerve was detected along with bilaterally symmetrical facial synkinesis involving orbicularis oculi and nasalis. R(1) and R(2) responses consistent with mis-reinnervation were recorded on the left-side using orbicularis oculi and nasalis muscles. Skin biopsy revealed acid-fast bacilli and sural nerve biopsy, the presence of granulomas. After 3 months of follow-up on WHO multi-drug therapy, an improvement in facial sensations was observed but without any change in facial synkinetic movements.\nDocument [14]: Title: Stroke in a young man: a late complication of radiation therapy. Abstract: This 37-year-old man presented with left sided facial warmth and numbness associated with new sudden-onset right hemiparesis. The patient first developed sudden numbness of his left lip and warmth in left ear which travelled to the rest of left face. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, Hodgkin lymphoma treated with radiation therapy at the age of 10, and sleeve gastrectomy for obesity 1 year ago complicated by bilateral ischaemic cerebral infarctions with residual left hemiparesis. No acute infarcts were found on MRI. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a complex atheroma near the sinotubular junction in ascending aorta.\nDocument [15]: Title: [Acute headache resulting from intracranial venous reflux due to occlusion of the brachiocephalic vein ipsilateral to a dialysis shunt]. Abstract: A 72-year-old man on hemodialysis for 7 years with end-stage renal disease was admitted to our institution due to an acute headache. Physical examination revealed normal signs except for noise on the back of his neck. His head CT and brain MRI showed no abnormal findings, while his MRA demonstrated abnormal signals in the left transverse to sigmoid sinus (T-S) suggesting a left dural arteriovenous fistula. After admission, his headache persisted and left orbital numbness also occurred. His digital subtraction angiography performed on the 5th day after admission showed no vascular malformation of either the T-S or cavernous sinus (CS). However, it showed occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein (BCV) and the origin of the left internal jugular vein (IJV) resulting in intracranial venous reflux. These findings indicated the possibility that his acute headache was caused by intracranial venous reflux and increase of intracranial pressure resulting from the occlusion of the BCV ipsilateral to a dialysis shunt. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for occlusion of the left BCV was performed on the 9th day and successful dilation of the lesion with a residual stenotic ratio less than 30 percent was obtained. After the angioplasty, venous reflux to the intracranial vein was markedly reduced and his headache and orbital numbness disappeared. One day after the procedure, MRA demonstrated the disappearance of the abnormal signals of the left T-S. Twelve months after discharge, he felt discomfort in the left of his face and the re-occlusion of the left VCV was demonstrated by angiography, therefore he received re-PTA. We recommend that physicians consider occlusion of the BCV ipsilateral to a dialysis shunt and intracranial venous reflux as a cause of acute headache in patients on hemodialysis.\nDocument [16]: Title: My hand in my ear: a phantom limb re-induced by the illusion of body ownership in a patient with a brachial plexus lesion. Abstract: Corporeal awareness of body unity, continuity, and integrity is hardwired in the brain, even following massive deafferentation. Following peripheral limb injury, referred phantom sensations are reported frequently on the cheek and, rarely, on the ear. Here, we explore how brain plasticity mechanisms induced by multisensory stimulation of different facial regions (cheek and ear) modulate the feeling that a complete missing limb is still attached to the body. We applied the modified rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm following synchronous and asynchronous stimulation of the face-hand and ear-hand in the unusual case of a patient with a brachial plexus lesion, who had lost upper-left limb sensation and developed a phantom sensation of the arm restricted to the ear. He experienced a strong illusion of ownership of the rubber hand during synchronous stroking of the ear but not the cheek and reported more defined tactile sensations in his previously numb body part during the illusion than when simply touching the ear. Phantom experiences are not exclusively based on sensory memories of the once-present body periphery, they are organized into a topographic cortical map with the ear-hand area adjoining but separate from the face. Multimodal experiences specifically modulate possible remapping of ear-hand representations and generate a more defined connection between the brain's memory of the body and what one feels of the actual physical body. We suggest that RHI is a form of sensory intervention that makes the best use of residual signals from disconnected body parts after peripheral injury, evoking and controlling the limb sensations.\nDocument [17]: Title: History of head trauma in a 6-year-old boy: maybe more than meets the eye (and head). Abstract: It is spring and you are meeting for the first time, Eddie, a recently turned 6-year-old boy who moved to the area in September of the previous year and is here for his 6-year-old health maintenance visit. Eddie's mother is concerned that although he is \"only\" in kindergarten, he is not retaining any information at school. His mother reports he knew some of his letters before kindergarten. Currently, when he is trying to write a word, for example, \"daddy\" he will need to ask his mother: \"what letter is the letter D?\" Before kindergarten, he knew his numbers 1 to 10. At times now, Eddie will forget these numbers. For example, \"if he is counting he will forget what comes after 4 and what comes after 9.\" Mother reports he will start crying for no apparent reason and if she asks why, he will say \"I don't know why.\" Mother is worried that Eddie is sad, although she denies suicidal ideation. She reports he used to like making noise with other kids, and now he cannot stand when the children are noisy. Eddie will comment he does not want to go to school because the kids make lots of noise and his head hurts. He complains of headaches as often as 2 to 3 times a month. She next states, \"This was not an issue before his head trauma.\" At this point, she reveals to you that in August, before the family relocated, Eddie fell from a 7-foot deck onto concrete while playing. He struck his head on the left side and lost consciousness for several seconds until shaken awake. He was nauseous and disoriented initially but without emesis or incontinence. He was taken to the local emergency department where he was admitted for 1 day and diagnosed with closed head injury, left frontal epidural hematoma, and question of postconcussive syndrome. Eddie has gone back to see the neurosurgeon twice over the last 6 months for scheduled visits and since the accident has had no further treatment.Eddie's mother reports that before the accident, if she read him a story from a book, he could remember the details from the story. Currently, he does not have good memory recall. Before the trauma, he did not attend a preschool program but stayed home with his mother full time. Eddie's first formal schooling has been kindergarten this year. When they moved, the neurosurgeon recommended he start school at the end of September given his head trauma in August. He had a recent computed tomography completed 3 months ago showing the epidural hematoma had completely resolved and the study was otherwise normal. His mother reports he had an evaluation the spring before the accident for a kindergarten screening test and was reported as \"excellent.\" Eddie's birth and medical history are otherwise unremarkable except for some seasonal allergies. He has not had a loss in language skill, although his mother reports he did not speak during his hospitalization. He\nDocument [18]: Title: Nonspecific Headache Diagnosed as a Brain Colloid Cyst with Hydrocephalus. Abstract: A 29-year-old male presented to our emergency department with complaints of a left frontal headache, similar to his prior headaches. He also reported about 30 minutes of facial and tongue numbness, left arm weakness, slurred speech and changes in hearing that had resolved prior to his arrival. Despite the short duration of the other neurologic symptoms, he also endorsed persistent \"dizziness.\" Despite his history of recurrent headaches, he had never had any neuroimaging. This, as well as his reports of new neurological symptoms, prompted his care team to obtain a non-contrast brain computed tomography. The findings were consistent with a mass with mild hydrocephalus. Patient underwent neurosurgical resection of the mass at a tertiary center. He did well after surgery and was discharged on postop day 6 with a diagnosis of colloid cyst.\nDocument [19]: Title: Chronic subdural hematoma after eccentric exercise using a vibrating belt machine. Abstract: We report a case of bilateral chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) in a 75-year-old man after exercise using a vibrating belt machine on the head. He suffered from headache and intermittent left side numbness for ten days. He denied any head injuries except eccentric exercise using a vibrating belt on his own head for 20 days. An MRI revealed bilateral CSDH. The hematoma was isodense on the CT scan. We made burr-holes on the both sides under local anesthesia. We identified the neomembrane and dark red subdural fluid on both sides. In the postoperative CT scan, we found an arachnoid cyst on the left temporal pole. Although the arachnoid cyst itself is asymptomatic, trivial injury such as vibrating the head may cause a CSDH.\nDocument [20]: Title: Cavernous Sinus Meningioma Resection Through Orbitozygomatic Craniotomy. Abstract: Meningiomas of the cavernous sinus (CS) present a neurosurgical challenge. The anatomic complexity of the area can create a potential for injury to neurovascular structures. This has traditionally limited total tumor removal. A thorough understanding of the cavernous sinus surgical anatomy can help overcome this problem. Patients with CS meningiomas generally present with cranial nerve deficits (III-VI), proptosis, and visual disturbances. Management of CS tumors is controversial and includes observation, stereotactic radiosurgery, and surgical resection. We present the case of a 43-year-old right-handed male who presented with right facial numbness. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed a right cavernous sinus tumor. He underwent stereotactic radiosurgery at an outside hospital. His facial numbness gradually improved. Four years later he had recurrence of the right facial numbness in the V3 distribution associated with right eyelid ptosis and diplopia. On neurologic examination he had decreased sensation to light touch in the 3 branches of the trigeminal nerve. He had a right eyelid ptosis and a 6-VI cranial nerve palsy. A new magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed radiologic progression of the tumor. An orbitozygomatic craniotomy was performed and gross total tumor resection was achieved through lateral wall of the cavernous sinus working mainly between V2 and V3. The facial numbness he had preoperatively gradually improved, and his extraocular movements and eyelid ptosis recovered completely. Histopathology showed a clear cell grade 2 meningioma. The patient received adjuvant radiosurgery. At 3-year follow-up, the patient was free of disease recurrence. CS surgery for meningioma is feasible with low morbidity and can provide benefits in improving preexisting cranial nerve dysfunction (Video 1).<sup>1-4</sup> Complete resection of the CS meningiomas is possible in most cases. CS tumors remain a surgical challenge, but accurate knowledge of surgical neuroanatomy and surgical approaches facilitates their safe and effective treatment. The patient gave informed consent for surgery, use of images, and video publication.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Patients using immunotherapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can develop ocular immune-related adverse effects (irAEs). Nivolumab (Opdivo<sup>&#174;</sup>;Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY, USA) is a commonly used ICI used to treat malignancies. A 75-year-old woman presented to our eye clinic with sudden loss in vision in the right eye. She had started nivolumab monotherapy 10 days before the onset of symptoms for the treatment of melanoma. Examination showed low visual acuity (20/170) in the right eye with few reactive cells and macular oedema and swelling in the anterior and posterior segments, respectively. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the right eye showed intra-retinal and sub-retinal fluid and multiple hyperreflective inner retinal round foci in the areas of inflammation. The differential diagnoses were infectious uveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome or masquerade retinopathy. After a full work-up, the patient was diagnosed with unilateral posterior uveitis. The patient responded to topical steroid therapy with improved vision (20/30). Uveitis is listed as an adverse effect on the prescribing list of the drug Opdivo<sup>&#174;</sup>. Although not reported before, our case demonstrated unilateral involvement. We thus recommend clinicians to be wary after complaints of side effects from their patients; ocular toxicities should be considered.\nDocument [2]: Title: [EVALUATION OF THE EFFICASY OF THE DRUG OPDIVO (NIVOLUMAB) IN A PATIENT DIAGNOSED WITH UNRESECTABLE SKIN MELANOMA, POSITIVE BRAF MUTATION AND DISEASE DISSEMINATION (CASE REPORT)]. Abstract: The case was analyzed for response to nivolumab (Opdivo) monotherapy in a patient with recurrent skin melanoma (10x6x6 cm) and disease dissemination (with multiple lung metastasis), positive for BRAF mutation that followed upon the local therapy (surgical excision) and 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (at CVD regimen - cisplatin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Histological results: melanoma. Immunohystochemical: S 100-positive; Melan A - positive; HMB45 - positive, AE1/AE3 - negative, p53 - positive in most cells, vim - positive, \u0251 sma - weak in most cells, Ki67 - positive in 20%, BRAFmut, ECOG performance status 1, LDH - 1320 U/L (N <308 U/L). The effective treatment available for metastatic or unresectable melanoma, Opdivo (nivolumab) was given at a dose of 240 mg every two weeks. Overall, 5 courses were indicated. Local recurrence of melanoma at the site of the primary excision began to resolve after 3 courses of immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab) which led to a significant decrease in the size of the cancer. And 5 courses of nivolumab therapy demonstrated complete regression of local recurrence and multiple lung metastases. No locoregional recurrence was found on MRI of the neck area. The patient's condition is now satisfactory. She doesn't feel pain and refuses to take pain relievers, leads an active lifestyle (ECOG 0). Serum level of LDH is within normal limits. Currently, the targeted therapy with low molecular weight selective inhibitors of mutant BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) and immune checkpoint blockers (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) is generally recommended for unresectable skin melanoma patients bearing BRAF mutations. Despite this dual treatment strategy, the use of even one nivolumab (in monoregimen), showed complete regression of both - the local recurrence and multiple lung metastases in the case of a positive BRAF mutation and substantially improved the survival of inoperable cancer patient.\nDocument [3]: Title: Did new treatments contribute to a decrease in melanoma deaths? Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in New Zealand, and New Zealand has one of the highest rates of melanoma incidence and mortality in the world. Monitoring by Environmental Health Intelligence NZ (EHINZ) has found a recent sharp decline in melanoma mortality rates in New Zealand. Since 2014 and 2015 (with 376 and 378 melanoma deaths, respectively), melanoma deaths have declined to 362 deaths in 2016, 308 deaths in 2017, and 296 deaths in 2018. We believe that two new PD-1 inhibitor drug treatments introduced in New Zealand in 2016-nivolumab (Opdivo, BMS) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, MSD)-may have contributed to this decrease in melanoma mortality. Other factors are unlikely to have had such a major effect, with the drop unlikely due to random variation, and no major changes in melanoma registrations or melanoma thickness at diagnosis over the past decade. While our monitoring of the time trend is descriptive only, and cannot attribute causality, it does suggest a recent decrease in melanoma mortality rates at the population level. These national-level statistics reflect both what might be expected in the New Zealand situation with the introduction of PD-1 inhibitor treatments, based on clinical trials, and what oncologists are seeing at an individual level. Further studies could investigate this observational finding, to confirm whether PD-1 inhibitor drug treatments are having an impact on melanoma mortality and survival rates in New Zealand.\nDocument [4]: Title: [Cancer immunotherapy: Rational and recent breakthroughs]. Abstract: Cancer immunotherapy has occupied a marginal therapeutic option in cancer despite strong arguments documenting the role of the immune system in controlling the proliferation of cancers. The recent success of immunotherapy results from a change in the past paradigm. From now on, the goal is not only to activate the immune system against tumor, but also to take account of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment Among these mechanisms, negative costimulatory molecules (CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.) expressed by T cells in the tumor could explain their lack of effectiveness in inhibiting tumor growth. Blocking these molecules allowed the reactivation of anti-tumor T cells. Clinically, the administration of anti-CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab: Yervoy<sup>&#174;</sup>) was granted marketing authorization for patients with metastatic melanoma. The anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab: Opdivo<sup>&#174;</sup>, pembrolizumab: Keytruda<sup>&#174;</sup>) have demonstrated clinical efficacy when compared to the standard therapy in metastatic melanomas, advanced lung cancers and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In phase I and II clinical trials, other tumors (Hodgkin's disease, head and neck cancers, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, etc.) appear to be responsive to these immunomodulators. These treatments were associated with the occurrence of side effects dominated by autoimmunity predictable by unlocking the breaks exerted by immune system to maintain tolerance against self-antigen. The optimization of therapeutic combination based on these molecules and the search for biomarkers associated with these treatments constitute a challenge for the future for this new therapeutic class of drugs for oncology.\nDocument [5]: Title: [Immunooncology in Urologic Cancers: Current Status]. Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are establishing itselves as a new systemic treatment option (in addition to chemotherapy and targeted therapy) for metastatic tumours. (Re)activating the immune system, these antibodies may lead to impressive remissions lasting for a long time in some patients. Regarding urological tumours, the anti-PD-1 antibody Nivolumab (Opdivo(\u00ae)) has been approved this year for advanced, previously treated renal cell carcinoma. In the United States, Atezolizumab (Tecentriq(\u00ae)) has been approved for metastatic urothelial carcinoma after platinum-based chemotherapy. In patients pre-treated with antiangiogenic drugs, Nivolumab has achieved a higher rate of remission (25 vs. 5%) and a 5.4-month increase in overall survival compared with Everolimus. An indirect comparison with chemotherapy demonstrates an increased remission rate (15%) and an increased 1-year survival rate (37%) for urothelial carcinoma after platinum-based chemotherapy with Atezolizumab. The frequency of side-effects resulting from these treatments is comparatively low. However, some patients experience what is called immune-mediated side-effects, which must be recognised and treated in a timely manner. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are being tested in numerous ongoing phase III clinical trials and have the potential to replace current first-line treatment options for metastatic tumours such as urothelial and renal cell carcinoma. These trials are also investigating anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies in combination with CTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibitors or antiangiogenic treatments. Approval trials are also investigating the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting.\nDocument [6]: Title: What is the importance of difference in LCM strategy in drug development? - Learnings from Keytruda and Opdivo. Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed how cancer is treated. As of February 2022, six immune checkpoint inhibitors had been approved, with Keytruda and Opdivo accounting for the majority of global sales. Here, the impact of the differences in commercial success between Keytruda and Opdivo is reviewed by analyzing inter-organizational deals since their launch in 2014. Both showed a correlation between the cumulative number of indications and product sales trends, the latter crossing from 2017 to 2018. Differences in sales were due to different approaches to life cycle management by inter-organizational deals and drug development strategies, the key to commercial success.\nDocument [7]: Title: Vitiligo-like Depigmentation in a Patient Undergoing Treatment with Nivolumab for Advanced Renal-cell Carcinoma. Abstract: Dear Editor, Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint. It has been approved for its use in several types of advanced solid tumors, including melanoma, lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The inhibition of PD-1 leads to an enhanced adaptive immune response against tumor cells through the activation of T-cells. Vitiligo-like depigmentation (VLD) is a well-known side-effect in patients with melanoma that are being treated with anti PD-1 therapies (1). However, its development in patients undergoing treatment with nivolumab for cancers other than melanomas has been described very rarely. To our knowledge, herein we report the second case of nivolumab-induced VLD in a patient with metastatic RCC (2). The patient was a 63-year-old man who had a medical history of advanced RCC. He had initially undergone nephrectomy, and three months later he presented with local relapse and lung metastases. He had then received different treatment regimes, presenting with progression each time, until he finally started treatment with nivolumab. Five months after its introduction, the patient developed a disseminated hypochromic eruption. No other drugs were started over that period. He had no personal or family history of vitiligo or other autoimmune disorders. Dermatological examination revealed multiple, symmetrical, well-demarcated, depigmented macules involving his face, neck, torso, hands, and forearms. (Figure 1, a). Preservation of pigment in hair follicles could be seen on the dorsal aspect of his hands (Figure 1, b). Two 4-mm punch biopsies were taken, one from one from a depigmented patch and another from normally pigmented skin. In the first one, immunohistochemical analysis with Melan-A immunostaining demonstrated the absence of melanocytes, whereas melanocytes were present in the second one. A CD-8+ positive infiltrate was present in both biopsies, especially in the first one (Figure 2). The patient was diagnosed with VLD associated with nivolumab therapy. Since the patient was asymptomatic, no treatment was prescribed. He was advised to protect the achromic areas from sun exposure. In our patient, a causal association between the onset of VLD and the treatment with nivolumab cannot be completely ruled out. However, the clinical presentation with flecked macules in sun-exposed areas was consistent with what has been described in other patients presenting with VLD after starting treatment with this chemotherapeutic agent. The time to onset in our case was also within the limits which have been previously reported for this side-effect (16-52 weeks) (3). Therefore, we believe that a causal association is very probable. In patients with advanced melanoma who are treated with PD-1 inhibitors, the development of vitiligo-like lesions has been proved to be associated with improved progression-free and overall survival rates (4,5). This mechanism is not fully understood, but it has been suggested that inhibition of PD-1 could cause a loss of tolerance to melanocytic antigens, thus leading to a CD-8 T-cell dependent destruction of melanocytes present in the melanoma as well as in healthy skin (3,5). The presence of CD8 T-lymphocytes in our patient's biopsies supports this\nDocument [8]: Title: Ipilimumab-Based Therapy: Consensus Statement From the Faculty of the Melanoma Nursing Initiative on Managing Adverse Events With Ipilimumab Monotherapy and Combination Therapy With Nivolumab. Abstract: Ipilimumab (Yervoy\u00ae) therapy improves outcomes in patients with resected stage III melanoma, and ipilimumab alone or combined with nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae) does so in those with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. These immunotherapies are associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). With prompt recognition and appropriate management, serious sequelae or unnecessary treatment discontinuation can be prevented. .\nDocument [9]: Title: Therapeutic efficacy of plant-produced Nivolumab in transgenic C57BL/6-hPD-1 mouse implanted with MC38 colon cancer. Abstract: The therapeutic blockade of inhibitory PD-1 signaling has emerged as an effective approach for cancer immunotherapy. Nivolumab (Opdivo&#174;), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the PD-1 immune checkpoint, is approved for treatment of several cancer indications. It functions by blocking the PD-1-mediated T-cell inhibition thus reinstating anticancer immune responses. Tremendous advances in plant biotechnology offer an alternative and economical strategy to produce therapeutic mAbs for immune-based therapies. In this study, recombinant anti-PD-1 Nivolumab was produced in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and the plant-produced anti-PD-1 mAb was exploited for cancer treatment in syngeneic mice model C57BL/6 mice that were used to test the antitumor efficacy of plant produced Nivolumab, along with commercial Opdivo&#174;. C57BL/6 syngeneic mice treated with plant produced anti-PD-1 mAb exhibited reduction in the growth of established MC38 tumors. The plant produced Nivolumab treatment showed 82.9% antitumor effect in decreasing the tumor volume along with 50% tumor-free mice, whereas Opdivo&#174; showed 90.26% reduction in volume without any tumor-free mice. Finally, plant-derived anti-PD-1 therapy was also well tolerated in tumor-bearing mice that correlated with no significant body weight changes. Overall, our plant-produced Nivolumab elicits significant inhibition of tumor growth <i>in vivo</i> and provides a proof-of-concept for the production of immunotherapy targeting PD-1.\nDocument [10]: Title: Nivolumab: a review of its use in patients with malignant melanoma. Abstract: Nivolumab (Opdivo(\u00ae)) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against programmed death receptor-1, a negative regulatory checkpoint molecule with a role in immunosuppression. The drug is administered intravenously and is approved for the treatment of unresectable malignant melanoma in Japan. The potential for intravenous nivolumab to be used in the treatment of advanced malignancies such as melanoma was initially demonstrated in phase I dose-ranging trials. Subsequently, in a noncomparative, open-label, phase II trial, almost one-quarter of Japanese patients with previously treated stage III/IV melanoma (recurrent or unresectable) achieved a partial tumour response with intravenous nivolumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The clinical benefit of the drug was durable, with patients surviving free from progression for a median of 172 days and median overall survival not yet reached. Nivolumab had an acceptable tolerability profile in this trial, with fewer than 18 % of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to the drug, the most common of which was increased \u03b3-glutamyl transferase. Thus, nivolumab is an emerging, promising option for the treatment of malignant melanoma.\nDocument [11]: Title: European Medicines Agency extension of indication to include the combination immunotherapy cancer drug treatment with nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) for adults with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. Abstract: On the 15 November 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted an extension to an existing indication for the use of nivolumab (Opdivo) in combination with ipilimumab (Yervoy) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with intermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The approval was based on results from the Pivotal CA209214 study, a randomised, open-label, phase III study, comparing nivolumab +ipilimumab with sunitinib in subjects\u226518 years of age with previously untreated advanced RCC (not amenable for surgery or radiotherapy) or metastatic RCC, with a clear-cell component. A total of 1096 patients were randomised in the trial, of which 847 patients had intermediate/poor-risk RCC and received either nivolumab (n=425) in combination with ipilimumab administered every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or sunitinib (n=422) administered orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle. A statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) was observed in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group compared with the sunitinib group in intermediate/poor-risk subjects (HR 0.63 (99.8% CI 0.44 to 0.89); stratified log-rank 2-sided p-value<0.0001). The median OS was not reached for the nivolumab + ipilimumab group and was 25.95 months for the sunitinib group. The OS rates were 89.5% and 86.2% at 6 months, and 80.1% and 72.1% at 12 months in the nivolumab +ipilimumab and the sunitinib groups, respectively. K-M curves separated after approximately 3 months, favouring nivolumab + ipilimumab. This was not mirrored in the favourable-risk patients where no statistically significant difference was observed between nivolumab + ipilimumab and sunitinib in favourable-risk patients (HR 1.45 (descriptive 99.8% CI 0.51 to 4.12), p =0.2715).\nDocument [12]: Title: Nivolumab for Metastatic Melanoma. Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer with a generally poor prognosis at Stage III-IV disease. Traditionally, metastatic melanoma was treated by surgical resection, when possible, and with systemic chemotherapy. New developments in molecular biology have led to the identification of immune checkpoints which are exploited by malignant cells, allowing them to go undetected by the immune system. Nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae) is a human monoclonal antibody which prevents immune inhibition by interacting with PD-1 on tumor cells; thus, increasing tumor-specific T cell proliferation. Nivolumab has demonstrated efficacy superior to that of standard chemotherapy and relative safety in clinical trials. Indeed, the outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma are being improved by novel biologic agents such as nivolumab.\nDocument [13]: Title: Successful Treatment of an Immune-Mediated Colitis Induced by Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy in a Patient with Advanced Melanoma. Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been used as immunotherapeutic agents in several malignancies because of their ability to modify the T cell-mediated response against tumor cells. Dual checkpoint inhibition improves remission rates in patients with metastatic melanoma compared to monotherapy. However, a higher incidence of toxicity, including immune-related colitis, has been reported before. A 54-year-old female was diagnosed with malignant melanoma on her left upper arm. Because of progressive metastatic disease, a rescue therapy with nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae) 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab (Yervoy\u00ae) 3 mg/kg was initiated and a clinical and radiological remission was achieved. Two weeks after completing the third cycle of the ICI therapy, the patient presented with persistent hemorrhagic diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain. A diagnostic colonoscopy revealed multiple ulcerative lesions and hemorrhagic colitis of the sigmoid and rectum. Due to the ongoing treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab, the diagnosis of a checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis was made and immunosuppression with local and systemic steroids, such as mesalazine was initiated. In order to achieve a long-lasting steroids reduction, we decided to start with infliximab (Remicade\u00ae 5 mg/kg body weight i.v. every 2 weeks). Clinical remission was achieved and prednisolone could be subsequently discontinued. Infliximab, in combination with mesalazine, could successfully induce a long-lasting remission without steroids. The treatment of ICI-induced colitis did not lead to a reoccurrence of malignant melanoma after 2 years of follow-up.\nDocument [14]: Title: Nivolumab-Induced Pneumonitis in Patient With Metastatic Melanoma Showing Complete Remission on 18F-FDG PET/CT. Abstract: A 49-year-old patient with metastatic melanoma was treated with nivolumab (Opdivo). An early F-FDG PET/CT after 2 cycles showed a progressive metabolic disease. A 4-month optimal follow-up F-FDG PET/CT showed a complete metabolic response. The treatment was stopped after 22 cycles because of immunotherapy-related pneumonitis. After discontinuation of treatment, PET/CT examinations demonstrated a metabolic complete remission during 2 years. The metabolic pattern on early PET was suggestive of pseudoprogression, which is a rare phenomenon reflecting an activation of inflammatory cells within the tumor microenvironment causing lesions to increase in size and to accumulate FDG until a sufficient immune response is developed.\nDocument [15]: Title: Pharmaceutical approval update. Abstract: Nivolumab (Opdivo) for unresectable or metastatic melanoma; ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir (Viekira Pak) for hepatitis C virus infection; and olaparib (Lynparza) for ovarian cancer.\nDocument [16]: Title: Successful Treatment of Refractory Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. Abstract: Treatment options for patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent, metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are limited, and prognosis is poor. Nivolumab (Opdivo) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who have disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. Recently, in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma a significant improvement of outcome and response was achieved with the combination of ipilimumab (CTLA4 antibody) and the programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitor nivolumab compared with monotherapy. Based on these results, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. So far, there have been no data concerning the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in squamous cell head and neck cancer. We here present the case of a 46-year-old male with refractory squamous cell head and neck cancer, who was successfully treated with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in combination with the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab.\nDocument [17]: Title: [Universal Health Coverage and Cancer Drugs - A Cost-Effectiveness Perspective]. Abstract: Japanese health system has been evaluated to be the closest to the ideal Universal Health Coverage(UHC)in the world. \"Ideal UHC\" is to ensure that all people could obtain the health services they need without suffering any financial hardship. However, maintaining current healthcare system, under which all medications are covered, is getting difficult due to the aging society and the existence of high-price drugs such as anti-cancer agents. Approval of OPDIVO(nivolumab)has raised the national discussion in Japan because of the possibility that the use of OPDIVO might collapse overall healthcare system. Many countries that have public health insurance system like Japan have introduced Health Technology Assessment(HTA)for pricing and reimbursement decision. In the UK, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence(NICE)is in charge of HTA and using health-economic data for reimbursement decisions. Japan has decided to implement HTA and the provisional phase has started this year. The use of health-economic data is different between Japan and UK. For instance, health-economic data is used only for pricing in Japan, although it is also used for reimbursement in the UK. HTA implementation in Japan has been criticized, saying that it might prohibit patients' access to medical treatments. However, the HTA is the solution of rising national burden of medical costs. It could benefit to sustainable UHC, and therefore, it could ensure patients' access to essential medicines.\nDocument [18]: Title: Fatal Myocarditis Following Treatment with the PD-1 Inhibitor Nivolumab. Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway function as immune checkpoint inhibitors, allowing the immune system to recognize tumors which otherwise escape immune surveillance. However, these agents can also elicit an autoimmune response by inhibiting the ability of non-neoplastic tissues and regulatory cells to suppress the immune system. Here we present a fatal case of active myocarditis in a 55-year-old man with non-small-cell lung cancer which occurred following monotherapy with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo). He presented with acute right-sided heart failure and died 1 day after admission. Postmortem examination revealed multiple gelatinous lesions in the myocardium of the interventricular septum and the bilateral atria and ventricles which had microscopic features diagnostic of myocarditis. Subsequent studies failed to identify an infectious cause. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are an increasingly common addition to anticancer regimens and they should be considered in the evaluation of acute myocarditis.\nDocument [19]: Title: U.S. FDA Approval Summary: Nivolumab for Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma Following Progression on Ipilimumab. Abstract: On December 22, 2014, the FDA granted accelerated approval to nivolumab (OPDIVO; Bristol-Myers Squibb) for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Approval was based on a clinically meaningful, durable objective response rate (ORR) in a non-comparative analysis of 120 patients who received 3 mg/kg of nivolumab intravenously every 2 weeks with at least 6-month follow-up in an ongoing, randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical trial. The ORR as assessed by a blinded independent review committee per RECIST v1.1 was 31.7% (95% confidence interval, 23.5-40.8). Ongoing responses were observed in 87% of responding patients, ranging from 2.6+ to 10+ months. In 13 patients, the response duration was 6 months or longer. The risks of nivolumab, including clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions (imARs), were assessed in 268 patients who received at least one dose of nivolumab. The FDA review considered whether the ORR and durations of responses were reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, the adequacy of the safety database, and systematic approaches to the identification, description, and patient management for imARs in product labeling. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(14); 3484-8. &#169;2017 AACR</i>.\nDocument [20]: Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Nivolumab, A Therapeutic Anti-Pd-1 Monoclonal Antibody: Impact of Handling and Stress. Abstract: Nivolumab, formulated in the medicine Opdivo<sup>&#174;</sup> (10 mg/mL), is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) used in the treatment of different types of cancer. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge about the behaviour of this protein with regards to the risk associated with its routine handling or unintentional mishandling, or when subjected to stress conditions in hospitals. These conditions can be simulated in forced degradation studies, which provide an in-depth understanding of the biophysical and biochemical properties of mAbs. In this study, we carried out a physicochemical and functional characterisation of nivolumab, which was subjected to various stress conditions: heat, freeze/thaw cycles, agitation, light exposure and high hypertonic solution. We used a wide range of analytical techniques: Far-UV CD, IT-FS, DLS, SE/UHPLC(UV)-[Native]MS, and ELISA. The results show that exposure to light was the stress test with the greatest impact on the samples, revelling the formation of non-natural dimers and a different isoform profile. In addition, nivolumab (Opdivo<sup>&#174;</sup>) demonstrated stability up to 60 &#176;C (1 h). As regards functionality all the nivolumab (Opdivo<sup>&#174;</sup>) stressed samples were found to be stable except for those subjected to light and agitation, and to a lesser extent, those subjected to FTC 5 and NaCl stresses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Ankle fractures are commonly treated by orthopedic surgeons. Fellowship versus non-fellowship training often adds a different perspective, use of specialty-specific implants, comfort with outpatient procedures, and may contribute to cost differences between surgeons. To assess the impact of fellowship training on the value of care provided, the difference in cost of ankle fracture open reduction internal fixation procedures between foot and ankle trained orthopedic surgeons and non-foot and ankle trained orthopedic surgeons over the past 10 years was retrospectively evaluated. We additionally evaluated the cost differences of ankle fracture open reduction internal fixations between hospitals, hospital-owned ambulatory surgery centers, and physician-owned ambulatory surgery centers. The study also assessed the costs effects of inpatient versus outpatient procedures and ankle open reduction internal fixation procedure volume of the surgeon observed within the timeframe of the study.\nDocument [2]: Title: The Operative Treatment of Ankle Fractures: A 10-Year Retrospective Study of 1529 Patients. Abstract: Ankle fractures are the second most common fracture of the lower limb and account for nearly 10% of all fractures. They range from simple to complex injuries and approximately 40% require surgical intervention. The aim of our study was to provide an up-to-date reference of the epidemiology, fracture, and fixation characteristics of operatively treated ankle fractures. We also sought to determine the number of patients undergoing further surgery through revision, implant removal, or ankle fusion. A retrospective observational study was conducted of 1529 consecutive patients that underwent operative intervention for an unstable ankle fracture between 2007 and 2017. Fractures of the distal tibia and pilon injuries were excluded. The mean age of patients was 41.8 years with 50.7% male. Unimalleolar fixation was performed in 60.1%, while bimalleolar and trimalleolar fixation was performed in 31.2% and 5%, respectively. Isolated syndesmotic fixation was performed in 3.8%. A posterior malleolus fracture was present in 28.6%, of which 31.6% underwent fixation. A further procedure was performed in 234 (15.3%) patients. Revision open reduction internal fixation was required in 1.4% and 0.8% underwent future ankle fusion. Treatment of ankle fractures makes up a sizeable part of orthopedic trauma practice with more than 1 in 7 patients requiring a second procedure. More complex fractures were predominantly seen in older females, while patients who suffered trimalleolar fractures have an increased likelihood of requiring future ankle fusion or revision. Despite this the rate of ankle fusion was <1%.\nDocument [3]: Title: Advances in the Surgical Management of Ankle Fractures. Abstract: Ankle fractures are one of the most common injuries treated by orthopedic surgeons worldwide. However, operative indications, techniques, and reported outcomes following operative fixation vary widely in the literature. This evidence-based review focuses on recent advances in the operative management of ankle fractures including arthroscopic-assisted surgery, deltoid ligament complex repair, expanded indications for posterior malleolus fixation, fibula intramedullary nailing, and dynamic syndesmosis repair.\nDocument [4]: Title: Results From an All Wales Trainee Led Collaborative Prospective Audit on Management of Ankle Fractures. Abstract: Aim The purpose of this all Wales national audit was to compare compliance against British Orthopedic Association Standards for Trauma (BOAST) guidelines on the management of ankle fractures. Methods A multi-center prospective audit of the management of adult ankle fractures was conducted between February 2, 2020, and February 17, 2020, via the Welsh Orthopedic Research Collaborative (WORC). Regional leads were recruited in nine NHS hospitals across six university health boards, and recruited collaborators in their respective hospitals. Questionnaires for the data collection on both surgical and conservative management were made available via a password-protected website (walesortho.co.uk). We defined early weight-bearing (EWB) as unrestricted weight-bearing on the affected leg within three weeks of injury or surgery and delayed weight-bearing (DWB) as unrestricted weight-bearing after three weeks of injury or surgery. Results A total of 28 collaborators contributed data for 238 ankle fractures. Poor documentation at the time of injury was noted. Less than 50% of patients with posterior malleolus fracture had a CT scan for further evaluation. Eighty-four percent of the non-operatively treated patients did not have a weight-bearing X-ray (WBXR). Patients who had a WBXR were more likely to be allowed EWB but this was not statistically significant. EWB was allowed in 59.43% and 10% of the non-operatively and operatively treated patients, respectively. DWB was higher in patients who had fixation of the posterior malleolus or syndesmosis. Conclusion There is poor compliance with BOAST guidelines on the management of ankle fractures across Wales. We need to improve documentation and also consider performing a CT scan when the posterior malleolus is fractured. A weight-bearing X-ray should be performed more often to ascertain the stability of an ankle fracture, and those that are deemed stable should be treated with early weight-bearing. The guidelines need to be clearer regarding weight-bearing after fixation especially when posterior malleolus and/or syndesmosis are fixed.\nDocument [5]: Title: A retrospective assessment of the clinical efficacy of different internal fixation methods in the treatment of distal fibula fractures in the elderly. Abstract: An ankle fracture is a fracture of the distal tibia or fibula that forms the ankle joint, usually associated with ligament and soft tissue injury, and is a common type of lower limb fracture and one of the most common types of fracture in the elderly. Although ankle fractures are one of the most common injuries seen by orthopedic trauma surgeons, there is no uniform protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of ankle fractures in the elderly, and there are many controversial indications for surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of different internal fixation methods in the treatment of distal fibular fractures in the elderly, in an effort to improve the rational selection and application of clinical acts. A retrospective analysis was performed on 68 cases of patients who suffered an ankle fracture and were treated with different internal fixation methods according to the fracture types and individual differences in distal fibula fractures. The postoperative therapeutic effect assessment was performed in terms of clinical examination, imaging evaluation, and AOFAS ankle-hind foot function scoring. There was no unhealed bone, ankle instability and loose/fractured internal fixation. Fracture healing time was 2.7 to 4.0 months (average 3.2 months). AOFAS score was 88.3 \u00b1 6.2, of which, 34 excellent cases, 30 good cases, and 4 fair cases. Ankle activity dorsiflexion 6\u00ba~18\u00ba, average 15\u00ba; plantar flexion 26\u00ba~47\u00ba, average 37\u00ba. A good clinical efficacy could be achieved from the most appropriate individualized internal fixation for distal fibula fractures of elderly patients.\nDocument [6]: Title: Ankle Fractures in Diabetic Patients: Report of Two Cases. Abstract: Although ankle fractures are very common cases for orthopedic surgeons with an easy diagnosis and very good outcomes either with conservative or with operative treatment, in diabetic patients, these fractures can be complex with difficult solutions. We report two cases with ankle fractures in diabetic patients from our department with demanding diagnostic or therapeutic approaches and poor outcomes. The first case, a 65-year-old man with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and neglected ankle fracture dislocation because of diabetic neuropathy, underwent open reduction internal fixation with additional external fixation. Early after the operation, he presented with pin-tract infection, and later after the operation, he developed osteomyelitis which led to salvage below-knee amputation. In the second case, a 70-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and severe coexisting medical comorbidities underwent open reduction internal fixation plus external fixation for an acute fracture-dislocation of the left ankle. Early after the operation, she developed ischemic lesions of the toes with worsened status despite the vascular surgeon's instructions. Although a below-knee amputation could be an acceptable choice, she denied it. As a result, systematic complications led to her death. It is very important for surgeons to follow an algorithm when they have to manage ankle injuries in diabetic patients because, in these patients, ankle fractures are very demanding and misdiagnosed cases with difficult treatment algorithms and often poor outcomes.\nDocument [7]: Title: [Modern aspects of the ankle fracture treatment]. Abstract: The ankle fractures continue to be a topical issue in orthopedic surgery. X-ray diagnostics, but primarily also other modem diagnostic procedures such as CT, MRI, and arthroscopy enable detection of not only fractures but also osteocartilaginous fractures and soft-tissue ligamentary lesions, which are frequent causes of pain and instability of the ankle. The key segment is the posterio-lateral segment and tibio-fibular syndesmosis whose integrity is sometimes only surgically establishable. In the ankle treatment, stable fixation - since recently by means of resorptive osteofixation materials - and early rehabilitation of the operated ankle are aimed at. The open and pylon fractures, as the most severe forms of ankle fractures, are treated by external fixation with minimum internal fixation (hybrid fixation) of the ankle with conversion of the rigid into a dynamic (articulated) external fixator enabling movement and nutrition of the damaged articular cartilage.\nDocument [8]: Title: The Effect of Insurance Type on Patient Access to Ankle Fracture Care Under the Affordable Care Act. Abstract: The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of insurance type (Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance) on the ability for patients with operative ankle fractures to access orthopedic traumatologists. The research team called 245 board-certified orthopedic surgeons specializing in orthopedic trauma within 8 representative states. The caller requested an appointment for their fictitious mother in order to be evaluated for an ankle fracture which was previously evaluated by her primary care physician and believed to require surgery. Each office was called 3 times to assess the response for each insurance type. For each call, information was documented regarding whether the patient was able to receive an appointment and the barriers the patient confronted to receive an appointment. Overall, 35.7% of offices scheduled an appointment for a patient with Medicaid, in comparison to 81.4%and 88.6% for Medicare and BlueCross, respectively (P < .0001). Medicaid patients confronted more barriers for receiving appointments. There was no statistically significant difference in access for Medicaid patients in states that had expanded Medicaid eligibility vs states that had not expanded Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement for open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture did not significantly correlate with appointment success rates or wait times. Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act, patients with Medicaid have reduced access to orthopedic surgeons and more complex barriers to receiving appointments. A more robust strategy for increasing care-access for patients with Medicaid would be more equitable.\nDocument [9]: Title: Editorial Commentary: Optimizing Surgical Management of Ankle Fractures: Is Arthroscopy the Answer? Abstract: The surgical management of ankle fractures can be an unforgiving endeavor. Subtle malreductions in fracture fragments lead to significant deviations in joint reactive forces and, consequently, accelerated arthritis. The diagnosis of associated ligamentous pathology, such as deltoid and syndesmotic injuries, is often difficult and ideal surgical management is debated. Ankle fractures that are seemingly optimally managed using traditional surgical techniques may remain persistently painful and function poorly-a scenario that begs the question, was there more to the injury than met the eye (or radiographs)? Here, unrecognized concomitant intra-articular injuries and subtle surgical malreductions have been implicated. In my practice, concurrent ankle arthroscopy at the time of definitive acute ankle fracture reduction and fixation results in improved accuracy of reduction, evaluation and management of concomitant syndesmotic and ligamentous injuries, assessment and treatment of occult intra-articular injuries, options for less-invasive fixation techniques through arthroscopic reduction, and a means to provide prognostic patient information. I typically reserve its use for fracture patterns that have been more closely associated with intra-articular injuries: high-energy mechanism injuries, Weber B and C fibula fractures, and those with a high likelihood of syndesmotic disruption based on preoperative imaging. Despite these intuitive advantages, concurrent ankle arthroscopy for acute fracture fixation is not routinely performed by most orthopedic surgeons, and a relative dearth of literature regarding its use and clinical impact remains.\nDocument [10]: Title: Effect of Early Weight Bearing on Outcomes After Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Trimalleolar Ankle Fractures. Abstract: Current practice allows early weight bearing of unstable ankle fractures after fixation. This study offers a unique comparison of early weight bearing (EWB) vs late weight bearing (LWB) in operatively stabilized trimalleolar ankle fractures. The goal of this study was to evaluate union rates, clinical outcomes, and complications for patients who were managed with EWB vs LWB. The authors performed a retrospective review of 185 patients who underwent surgical stabilization for trimalleolar ankle fracture. Fixation of the posterior malleolus and weight bearing status were determined by surgeon preference. For this study, EWB was defined as 3 weeks or less and LWB was defined as greater than 3 weeks. Patients were evaluated for fracture union and implant failure. Complications and clinical outcomes included ambulatory status, infection rate, and return to surgery. The EWB group included 47 (25.4%) patients, and the LWB group included 138 (74.6%) patients. Of the 7 nonunions, 1 (14.3%) occurred in the EWB group and 6 (85.7%) in the LWB group. A total of 72 (38.9%) posterior malleolar fractures were operatively stabilized, and stabilization did not affect union rates. Syndesmotic fixation was required for 12.5% of patients, despite posterior malleolar stabilization. Syndesmotic fixation increased the union rate 2.5 times. Deep infection and open fracture decreased union. No difference was seen between groups in implant failure, union rate, infection, or return to the operating room. No deleterious effect of EWB in operatively treated trimalleolar ankle fractures was found for union, implant failure, infection, or reoperation. Syndesmotic fixation may offer an advantage over posterior malleolar fixation, with improved union rates.

Abstract: Over the years, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of fluoroscopy in orthopaedics. The risk of contracting cancer is significantly higher for an orthopedic surgeon. Hip and spine surgeries account for 99% of the total radiation dose. The amount of radiation to patients and operating surgeon depends on the position of the patient and the type of protection used during the surgery. A retrospective study to assess the influence of the radiation exposure of the operating surgeon during fluoroscopically assisted fixation of fractures of neck of femur (dynamic hip screw) and ankle (Weber B) was performed at a district general hospital in the United Kingdom.\nDocument [12]: Title: Characteristics of and Factors Contributing to Immediate Postoperative Pain After Ankle Fracture Surgery. Abstract: To build an appropriate strategy of pain management after ankle fracture surgery, surgeons need to know the characteristics of postoperative ankle pain and its contributing factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the maximum pain period after ankle fracture surgery and the factors affecting postoperative pain using a linear mixed model when patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was used as a basic modality. A total of 219 adult patients (108 males and 111 females; mean age 51.2 \u00b1 15.9 years) who had undergone operative treatment for ankle fractures were included. Data on fracture severity, causes of injury, interval between injury and surgery, anesthesia method, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and operative time were collected. Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale preoperatively and postoperatively every 8 hours. Intravenous PCA was prescribed to all patients. The chronologic pattern of postoperative pain and factors affecting it were statistically analyzed using a linear mixed model. Maximum postoperative pain was observed at 8 hours postoperatively, and the maximum pain numerical rating scale score was 3.92, measured at 8-hour intervals. The severity of fracture (p = .01) was the only significant factor contributing to postoperative pain after ankle fracture surgery on multivariate analysis. Clinicians should consider the chronologic pattern of postoperative pain after ankle fracture surgery during postoperative pain management. Interventions for pain control, in addition to PCA, might be needed at ~8 hours postoperatively, especially for those with severe ankle fractures.\nDocument [13]: Title: Removal of the syndesmotic screw after the surgical treatment of a fracture of the ankle in adult patients does not affect one-year outcomes: a randomised controlled trial. Abstract: Our aim was to compare the one-year post-operative outcomes following retention or removal of syndesmotic screws in adult patients with a fracture of the ankle that was treated surgically. A total of 51 patients (35 males, 16 females), with a mean age of 33.5 years (16 to 62), undergoing fibular osteosynthesis and syndesmotic screw fixation, were randomly allocated to retention of the syndesmotic screw or removal at three months post-operatively. The two groups were comparable at baseline. One year post-operatively, there was no significant difference in the mean Olerud-Molander ankle score (82.4 retention vs 86.7 removal, p = 0.367), the mean American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score (88.6 vs 90.1, p = 0.688), the mean American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons foot and ankle score (96.3 vs 94.0, p = 0.250), the mean visual analogue pain score (1.0 vs 0.7, p = 0.237), the mean active dorsiflexion (10.2\u00b0 vs 13.0\u00b0, p = 0.194) and plantar flexion (33.6\u00b0 vs 31.3\u00b0, p = 0.503) of the ankle, or the mean radiological tibiofibular clear space (5.0 mm vs 5.3 mm, p = 0.276) between the two groups. A total of 19 patients (76%) in the retention group had a loose and/or broken screw one year post-operatively. We conclude that removal of a syndesmotic screw produces no significant functional, clinical or radiological benefit in adult patients who are treated surgically for a fracture of the ankle.\nDocument [14]: Title: Comparison of Complications, Metalwork Removal and Cost Between Locking and Tubular Plates for Lateral Malleolus Fractures Fixation. Abstract: Introduction Ankle fractures are common injuries in orthopaedic practice. Open reduction with internal fixation is the main line of management of displaced ankle fractures in fit patients. The study aims to analyse the complications, re-operation rate and cost difference between one-third tubular and locking plates which are the most frequently used constructs in lateral malleolus fractures. Materials and methods The total number of presented ankle fractures from April to August during the years 2015, 2017 and 2019 to our Tertiary Hospital in the United Kingdom were screened. Data including operative fixation, plate used, complication rates, the need for revision surgery and metalwork removal were collected from the hospital's electronic Virtual Trauma Board. Patients who had less than one-year follow-up were excluded. Results A total of 174 patients were included which represents more than half of presented ankle fractures (56%) with a decline in the mean age of operated patients from 56.4 in 2015 to 46.2 in 2019. The majority of fixation used tubular plates (n=122) versus (n=52) for locking plates. Locking plate fixation doubled from 10 in 2015 to 23 in 2019. However, they only contributed to 27% of the total operated ankle fractures. Despite the initial higher complications and removal rates of locking plates in 2015 (P<0.042 and P<0.038 respectively), there was no significant difference in overall complications, revision rates, and metalwork removal between locking plates and tubular plates (p=0.084, FEp= 0.158 and p=0.096 respectively). There was an estimated extra cost of \u00a315938.60 for the use of locking plates during the study timeline. Conclusion There was no significant difference in overall complications, revision surgery and metalwork removal between tubular and locking plates in treating lateral malleolus fractures despite the significantly higher cost of locking constructs. Further studies are needed to illustrate the trend and cost-effective analysis of the tubular and locking plates in treating ankle fractures.\nDocument [15]: Title: Challenges and Controversies in Foot and Ankle Trauma. Abstract: Management of foot and ankle trauma continues to evolve and change. It is important to be informed about the latest challenges and controversies in management of these injuries, which include ankle fractures, calcaneus fractures, Lisfranc injuries, and Jones fracture. Important concepts related to ankle fracture are the changing indications for surgery, utilization of stress radiographs, the role of arthroscopy, repair of the deltoid ligament, fixation of the posterior malleolus, and diagnosis and treatment of syndesmotic injuries. Regarding calcaneus fractures, discussion revolves around defining indications for fixation, factors that influence outcomes, less invasive approaches versus traditional extensile exposures, and the nature of the constant fragment. With Lisfranc injuries, the orthopaedic surgeon should be aware of fixation methods as well as the issue of fixation versus fusion. Discussion of Jones fracture should include evaluation of indications and different fixation techniques.\nDocument [16]: Title: Predictors of Adverse Events for Ankle Fractures: An Analysis of 6800 Patients. Abstract: Ankle fractures are one of the most common injuries seen by orthopedic surgeons. It is therefore essential to understand the risks associated with their treatment. Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program(\u00ae) database from 2006 to 2013, the patient demographics, comorbidities, and 30-day complications were collected for 5 types of ankle fractures. A bivariate analysis was used to compare the patient demographics, comorbidities, and complications across all Common Procedural Terminology codes. A multivariable logistic regression model was then used to assess the odds of minor and major postoperative complications within 30 days after open treatment. A total of 6865 patients were included in the analysis. Of these patients, 2507 (36.5%) had bimalleolar ankle fractures. The overall rate of adverse events for ankle fractures was low. Bimalleolar fractures had the greatest rate of major (2.6%, n = 64), minor (3.8%, n = 94), and total (5.7%, n = 143) complications. When controlling for individual patient characteristics, bimalleolar fractures were associated with 4.92 times the odds (95% confidence interval 1.80 to 13.5; p = .002) of developing a complication compared with those with a medial malleolar fracture. The risk factors driving postoperative complications for all ankle fractures were age >65 years, obesity, diabetes, American Society of Anesthesiologists score >2, and functional status (p < .05). Although the overall rate of adverse events for ankle fractures was low, bimalleolar fractures were associated with 5 times the odds of developing a complication compared with medial malleolar fractures. Orthopedic surgeons must be aware of the risk factors that increase the rate of ankle fracture complications to improve patients' quality of care.\nDocument [17]: Title: Complications after revision surgery of malreduced ankle fractures. Abstract: Ankle fractures are common orthopedic injuries requiring reduction and cast immobilization or fixation. Fractures fixed in a malreduced (misaligned) position can require revision surgery. However, because this has been a relatively rare occurrence, little is known about the complications that can occur after such surgery. We reviewed all adult closed ankle fractures that underwent revision surgery for technical failure in a regional trauma hospital from January 2007 to January 2010. Those with open fractures and those who required external fixation at any point in their treatment were excluded. Nine patients underwent revision surgery during the study period. Of these 9 patients, 3 (33%) developed a deep infection, all with positive microbiology cultures for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Each of these patients underwent removal of the metalwork and wound debridement, followed by plastic surgery free flap coverage. In addition to the 3 infection cases, those with noninfected complications included 1 patient (11%) with chronic regional pain syndrome, 1 (11%) with failure of plate fixation, and 1 (11%) with persistent pain requiring arthroscopy and debridement. The overall incidence of complications was 66.67% in this group of 9 patients who had undergone revision surgery for the treatment of a malreduced malleolar ankle fracture. Although our observational study involved a small subset of patients who had undergone surgical repair for ankle fracture, we suggest that if revision surgery will be undertaken, the high incidence of infection and the potential need for plastic surgery should be highlighted during the consent process before the original, open reduction internal fixation procedure.\nDocument [18]: Title: Intraoperative radiation use by trainees during ankle fracture fixation. Abstract: Orthopedic trainees are assessed during training regarding their use of radiological screening during operative procedures. The authors investigated whether orthopedic trainees' use of fluoroscopic screening during ankle fixation operations varied with the 2 variables of consultant supervision and trainee experience. Data from operative fixation of isolated Weber B ankle fractures were reviewed. The intraoperative radiation dose was retrieved from radiographers' data. Operations performed by consultants were used as a control group (n=25 patients). Trainee supervision was assessed as \"trainer in operating room (OR)\" and \"trainer out of OR.\" Regarding experience, the patients were divided into those operated on primarily by trainees in their first (n=36 patients) and in their last (n=34 patients) 3 years of formal specialist training. All trainee groups used more radiation than consultants. Supervision did not affect the radiation use of senior trainees (P<.05). Senior trainees used less radiation than their junior peers (P<.02). Junior trainees supervised by a trainer in the OR used less radiation than junior trainees supervised by a trainer outside of the OR (P<.05). During open reduction and internal fixation of ankle fractures, junior orthopedic trainees use less intraoperative radiation when they are supervised by a trainer in the OR. The more experience a surgeon has, the less fluoroscopic screening is used during operative ankle fixation.\nDocument [19]: Title: Current management of trimalleolar ankle fractures. Abstract: A trimalleolar ankle fracture is considered unstable and treatment is generally performed operatively. Computed tomography is important for the operative planning by providing an elaborated view of the posterior malleolus.Trimalleolar ankle fractures have a rising incidence in the last decade with up to 40 per 100,000 people per year. With a growing number of elderly patients, trimalleolar ankle injuries will become more relevant in the form of fragility fractures, posing a particular challenge for trauma surgeons.In patients with osteoporotic trimalleolar ankle fractures and relevant concomitant conditions, further evidence is awaited to specify indications for open reduction and internal fixation or primary transfixation of the ankle joint.In younger, more demanding patients, arthroscopic-assisted surgery might improve the outcome, but future research is required to identify patients who will benefit from assisted surgical care.This review considers current scientific findings regarding all three malleoli to understand the complexity of trimalleolar ankle injuries and provide the reader with an overview of treatment strategies and research, as well as future perspectives.

Abstract: There exist controversies in the surgical treatment of maisonneuve injury with regard to reduction and fixation of syndesmosis and management of proximal fibular fracture. It is very important for the orthopaedic surgeons to learn more techniques and avoid pitfalls from clinical practice. We summarized the clinical data of 1 failed case, a 20-year-old girl with big body weight who underwent a primary surgery for the treatment of maisonneuve fracture with minimally invasive reduction and fixation of ankle syndesmosis and posterior malleolus and open reduction and internal fixation of medial malleolus, then a revision surgery for the treatment of iatrogenic syndesmotic malreduction with open reduction and re-stabilization of ankle syndesmosis supplemented with open reduction and internal fixation of proximal fibular facture. The malreduction of distal fibula was not found until finishing the postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan 2 weeks after the primary surgery, then the patient experienced an revision surgery including removal of the screws installed primarily for fixation of ankle syndesmosis, and open reduction and internal fixation of proximal fibular fracture, and limited open reduction and re-stabilization of ankle syndesmosis. Then the patient rehabilitated regularly under the direction of the surgeon who performed these two operations, and the postoperative recovery was smooth, then the hardwares for fixation of ankle syndesmosis and fracture of proximal fibula and medial malleolus were removed at different postoperative time. The patient experienced an excellent outcome at the end of the 3-year follow-up. The reasons for the failure in this case might include the overemphasized minimally invasive technique in the process of reduction, inaccurate assessment of intraoperative fluoroscopy and postoperative radiographs, and inappropriate utilization of the reduction clamp. Attention should be paid to the fact that an obliquely placed clamp for closed reduction of diastasis of ankle syndesmosis could result in syndesmotic malreduction. The worsened alignment of the fracture end of proximal fibula observed by intraoperative fluoroscopy may alert surgeons to syndesmotic malreduction. Partial exposure of syndesmosis and anatomical reduction and fixation of proximal fibular fracture may be useful measurres to avoid malreduction of ankle syndesmosis in the surgical treatment of maisonneuve injury in some patient, especially the patient with critically destabilized ankle.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: A 36-year-old woman complained of bilateral lower limb weakness for the last 3 days. She could move her upper limb, neck, and facial muscles and had no respiratory or swallowing difficulties. About 4 years ago, she complained of sudden weakness involving her lower limbs. Two years later, she had another episode involving only the right upper limb. In both cases, she was hypokalemic and received oral and intravenous potassium. She is a known diabetic and has polycystic ovary disease. Her blood pressure was 150/100 mm Hg, and body mass index was 29. Her serum potassium was 2 mEq/L, plasma renin 5 ng/dL, plasma aldosterone 0.63 \u00b5IU/mL, and aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio 8. Cushing syndrome was considered a possibility. Subsequent analysis indicated a baseline cortisol level of 19.6 \u00b5g/dL at 8 Am. A screening overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) showed 17 \u00b5g/dL cortisol. The low-dose DST revealed a cortisol level of 10.8 \u00b5g/dL. Adrenocorticotropin level was 196 pg/mL, and 24-hour urinary cortisol level was 1284 mg/dL. A high dose of 8-mg DST at 11 Pm to find the source of hypercortisolism performed yielded 15.9 \u00b5g/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary displayed a well-defined, heterogeneously enhanced mass lesion (15 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 11 mm) in the sella with mild suprasellar extension. Transsphenoidal resection and stereotactic radiosurgery were performed on the tumor with hormone replacement and glycemic control following surgery.\nDocument [2]: Title: Coexistence of three distinct adrenal tumors in the same adrenal gland in a patient with primary aldosteronism and preclinical Cushing's syndrome. Abstract: A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of hypokalemia. Physical examination revealed no signs of excessive adrenocortical steroid production, as are found in Cushing's syndrome. Her plasma renin activity (PRA) was suppressed (0.10 ng/ml per h), and her serum aldosterone level was high (30.0 ng/dl). PRA was not increased after a renin-releasing test. Her plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was low (<5 pg/ml), but her serum cortisol level was normal (21.0 microg/dl). Administration of 8 mg dexamethasone did not suppress her plasma cortisol level. Finally, she was diagnosed with clinical primary aldosteronism associated with preclinical Cushing's syndrome. Magnetic resonance image revealed three sequential nodular masses (each 15 mm x 15 mm) in the right adrenal gland. A right adrenalectomy was performed by endoscopy. The three removed tumors appeared to have different characteristics. Microscopic examination revealed that the upper and lower tumors were adrenocortical adenomas, and the middle tumor was a black adenoma. Immunohistochemical staining for the enzymes involved in cortisol biosynthesis suggested that the upper tumor secreted aldosterone, whereas either or both of the two other tumors secreted cortisol. Surprisingly, at 33 years of age, she had been diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome, due to a cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenoma, and she had received a left adrenalectomy. Clinically and pathophysiologically, this was a very rare case.\nDocument [3]: Title: Fluconazole treatment in severe ectopic Cushing syndrome Abstract: Severe Cushing syndrome (SCS) is considered an emergency that requires immediate treatment to lower serum cortisol levels. Fluconazole may be considered an alternative treatment in Cushing syndrome when ketoconazole is not tolerated or unavailable. We report a 39-year-old woman with a history of partial pancreaticoduodenectomy due to a periampullary neuroendocrine tumor with locoregional extension. Three years after surgery, she developed liver metastases and was started on 120 mg of lanreotide/month, despite which, liver metastases progressed in the following 6 months. The patient showed extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, delirium, moon face, hirsutism and severe proximal weakness. Laboratory tests showed anemia, hyperglycemia and severe hypokalemia. 24-h urinary free cortisol: 2152 nmol/day (reference range (RR): <276), morning serum cortisol 4883.4 nmol/L (RR: 138\u2013690), ACTH 127.3 pmol/L (RR: 2.2\u201310). She was diagnosed with ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS). On admission, she presented with acute upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding and hemodynamic instability. Intravenous fluconazole 400 mg/day was started. After 48 h, her mental state improved and morning cortisol decreased by 25%. The dose was titrated to 600 mg/day which resulted in a 55% decrease in cortisol levels in 1 week, but then had to be decreased to 400 mg/day because transaminase levels increased over 3 times the upper normal level. After 18 days of treatment, hemodynamic stability, lower cortisol levels and better overall clinical status enabled successful bilateral adrenalectomy. This case report shows that intravenous fluconazole effectively decreased cortisol levels in SCS due to EAS.\nDocument [4]: Title: Bilateral adrenocortical adenomas causing ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome at different periods: a case report and discussion of corticosteroid replacement therapy following bilateral adrenalectomy. Abstract: We report a rare case of bilateral adrenocortical adenomas causing ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome at different periods 9 yr apart. The subject, a 24-yr-old woman, in June 1989 had a typical Cushingoid appearance. Her baseline plasma cortisol levels did not show a diurnal rhythm and she had a very low baseline plasma ACTH level. Plasma cortisol levels could not be suppressed by overnight low-dose or two-day high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Marked uptake of 131I-6beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) was observed in the right adrenal gland. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a right adrenal tumor. The right adrenal gland with adenoma was removed. The non-tumorous part of the adrenal cortex was atrophic. By April 1998, she had experienced a weight gain of more than 20 kg over a two-yr period. The baseline plasma cortisol levels were at the lower limit of the normal range with loss of diurnal rhythmicity. The baseline plasma ACTH levels were very low. Neither a two-day low-dose nor a two-day high-dose dexamethasone suppression test could suppress serum cortisol or urinary free cortisol levels. NP-59 adrenal scan revealed increased uptake of the left adrenal gland at 72 h after intravenous injection of the tracer. Abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) all demonstrated a left adrenal mass. Left adrenalectomy was performed in June 1998; histological features showed a cortical adenoma and atrophic change in the non-tumorous part of the adrenal cortex. Elevated plasma ACTH levels after bilateral adrenalectomy could be suppressed with conventional corticosteroid replacement therapy and overnight low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.\nDocument [5]: Title: Continuous Etomidate for the Management of Cushing's Syndrome Complicated by Pulmonary Nocardiosis. Abstract: Severe Cushing's syndrome is associated with significant complications including opportunistic infections. In the setting of infection, urgent reduction of circulating cortisol is warranted and commonly used oral medications have a slow onset of effect. Here we describe a 29-years old female who presented to an outside hospital with symptoms of untreated Cushing's syndrome on ketoconazole. Following identification of a pulmonary <i>Nocardia spp</i> infection, she was transferred for a higher level of care. Her initial serum ACTH and cortisol levels after transfer were 106pg/mL and 53.7mCg/dL respectively. Given the severity of her nocardiosis and lack of response to ketoconazole, the patient was placed in the ICU and started on a continuous etomidate infusion. Her serum cortisol rapidly decreased to 5.7mCg/dL. She was transitioned to metyarapone and the etomidate infusion was weaned to off. The etomidate infusion was well tolerated without adverse effects or need for an advanced airway. Following discontinuation of etomidate, she was found to have a pituitary microadenoma that was resected. The patient was discharged from the hospital on antibiotics for the management of her <i>Nocardia spp</i> infection. In patients with severe Cushing's syndrome, continuous etomidate may be safe and effective for patients who are unresponsive to other therapies.\nDocument [6]: Title: A Rare Case of Placental Abruption and Postpartum Compression Fractures in Pregnancy With Cushing Syndrome. Abstract: Cushing syndrome (CS) is a disorder rarely found during pregnancy. Patients with CS usually receive treatment before pregnancy. In addition, hypercortisolism suppresses gonadotropins, leading to amenorrhea or irregular menstruation. Therefore, few reports have described cases of pregnancy with untreated CS. Here, we observed the changes in the cortisol level of a 38-year-old woman with adrenal CS before and throughout pregnancy and delivery. She also had primary aldosteronism, and we were able to follow her plasma aldosterone levels. Her symptoms of CS before pregnancy were submandibular acne and irregular menstruation, but after conception, \"moon face\" and fatigue appeared. Laboratory tests also revealed impaired glucose tolerance, hypokalemia, lymphocytopenia, and increased urinary free cortisol levels. After administration of metyrapone to ameliorate her general condition, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in the nineteenth week of pregnancy. After the operation, the patient's symptoms improved, and the cortisol level was maintained with hydrocortisone supplementation. The patient's plasma aldosterone level and blood pressure did not deteriorate throughout the course. However, the delivery was complicated by placental abruption. One month after delivery, the mother presented with compression fractures. We review the literature and discuss the treatment and complications of pregnancy with CS.\nDocument [7]: Title: A case of Cushing's syndrome presenting as endometrial hyperplasia. Abstract: We describe here the case of a 39-year-old woman with a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma and she presented with endometrial hyperplasia and hypertension without the specific characteristics of Cushing's syndrome. The patient had consulted a gynecologist for menometrorrhagia 2 years prior to her referral and she was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia and hypertension. Her blood pressure and the endometrial lesion were refractory despite taking multiple antihypertensives and repetitive dilation and curettage and progestin treatment. On admission, the clinical examination revealed mild central obesity (a body mass index of 22.9 kg/m2, a waist circumference of 85 cm and a hip circumference of 94cm), but there was no hirsutism and myopathy. She showed impaired glucose tolerance on an oral glucose tolerance test. The biochemical hypercortisolemia together with the prolactin and androgen levels were evaluated to explore the cause of her anovulation. Adrenal Cushing's syndrome was confirmed on the basis of the elevated urinary free cortisol (454 microg/24h, normal range: 20-70) with a suppressed ACTH level (2.0 pg/mL, normal range: 6.0-76.0) and the loss of circadian cortisol secretion. A CT scan revealed a 3.1 cm, hyperechoic, well-marginated mass in the left adrenal gland. Ten months post-adrenalectomy, the patient had unintentionally lost 9 kg of body weight, had regained a regular menstrual cycle and had normal thickness of her endometrium.\nDocument [8]: Title: Carcinoembryonic antigen-producing adrenal adenoma resected using combined lateral and anterior transperitoneal laparoscopic surgery. Abstract: A 74-year-old woman presented with symptoms consistent with hyperadrenocorticism and hyperca-techolaminism. She had a cushingoid appearance and her cortisol level was elevated. Her serum dopamine and noradrenalin levels were also elevated. Computed tomography detected a left adrenal mass measuring 3.5 cm multiply 3.0 cm in diameter. Metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy was negative. Unexpectedly, the serum Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was elevated. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed increased uptake in the adrenal tumor only, with a maximum standardized uptake value of 2.8. Selective venography and blood sampling revealed that the concentrations of cortisol, catecholamines and CEA were significantly elevated in the vein draining the tumor. A diagnosis of CEA-producing benign adenoma was made. After preoperative management, we performed a combined lateral and anterior transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenectomy. Her vital signs remained stable during surgery. Histopathological examination revealed a benign adenoma. Her cortisol, catecholamine and CEA levels normalized immediately after surgery. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of CEA-producing adrenal adenoma, along with a review of the relevant literature, and discuss our laparoscopic surgery techniques.\nDocument [9]: Title: Resistant hypertension after shockwave lithotripsy: the rude awakening of an adrenal incidentaloma. Abstract: A 41-year-old woman presented to the hospital because of left flank pain. CT scan of the kidneys revealed left-sided calculi and an incidental right adrenal mass, no other symptoms noted. She then underwent shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). However, immediately postoperatively, she had elevated blood pressure and remained hypertensive despite having four different medications. How SWL could have increased blood pressure could not be identified. On endocrine consult 16 months after SWL, she was found to now exhibit signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. Further workup revealed the adrenal incidentaloma to be cortisol-secreting. After undergoing right laparoscopic adrenalectomy, her blood pressure normalised, cortisol levels decreased and signs of Cushing's syndrome gradually improved. We hypothesise that the performance of the SWL could have triggered the adenoma to 'awaken' from being non-functioning to cortisol-producing since this was the only intervening event. Observations of other patients are needed to validate our hypothesis.\nDocument [10]: Title: A Unique Presentation of Nelson Syndrome Due to Partial Adrenal Insufficiency Without Bilateral Adrenalectomy. Abstract: Nelson syndrome is a rare disorder, characterized by clinical features arising from an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary macroadenoma after bilateral adrenalectomy. Common symptoms of Nelson syndrome include weight gain, vision problems, and skin hyperpigmentation, among many others. In this case report, a 58-year-old Asian female who displayed clinical features akin to Nelson syndrome despite not undergoing bilateral adrenalectomy is investigated. The patient has a past history of an ACTH-secreting pituitary macroadenoma, for which a transsphenoidal resection was performed along with radiation therapy. A year following this, she displayed severe facial and neck hyperpigmentation. According to the laboratory results obtained, the patient displayed initial high ACTH levels and low-normal AM cortisol levels, which are signs of partial adrenal insufficiency. A brain MRI was performed, which confirmed stable residual tumor tissue in the cavernous sinus. The results pointed to the adrenal glands as the cause of the hyperpigmentation, and the patient was diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency. To bring her ACTH levels and low-normal AM cortisol into the proper range, she was given low-dose hydrocortisone and monitored for five years. Over this time period, her hyperpigmentation improved significantly and eventually resolved entirely, and her ACTH levels were lowered, indicating that hydrocortisone was the appropriate treatment for normalizing ACTH levels. In this case, it was determined that unresponsive adrenal glands lead to high ACTH levels, which resulted in an atypical case of Nelson syndrome and the physical symptom of hyperpigmentation.\nDocument [11]: Title: [A case of nasal NK/T cell lymphoma presenting with bilateral giant adrenal tumors]. Abstract: A 76-year-old woman presented to a clinic with fever and loss of body weight. Abdominal echogram showed bilateral adrenal swelling (left adrenal 90x80 mm, right adrenal 50x20 mm) and she was admitted to the hospital for further examination. A tumor was also found inside nasal cavity by enhanced computed tomography (CT), and abnormal uptake in the nasal cavity and adrenal gland was shown in gallium scintigraphy. Laboratory tests revealed the elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and sIL-2R. Biopsy of the nasal tumor revealed nasal natural killer or thymus-derived (NK/T) cell lymphoma. No Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -encoded RNA was detected in tissue. After THP-COP chemotherapy regimen, both the nasal and adrenal tumors decreased in size. However, a CT scan taken on admission revealed a pulmonary embolism. After treatment with heparin and warfarin, emboli disappeared. Chemotherapy was continued, but perforation of the small intestine occurred. Since the prognosis was poor, no operation was performed. Her condition slowly, and she died 60 days after admission. Since she had a high level of plasma ACTH (158.0 pg/ml) and normal serum cortisol (14.6 microg/dl), partial adrenal insufficiency was suspected. In addition, since her cortisol circadian rhythm was lost and cortisol levels were not completely suppressed by the 1 mg and 8 mg dexamethasone test, she met the criteria of the diagnosis of preclinical Cushing syndrome. NK/T cell lymphoma with giant adrenal tumor is extremely rare, but should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of bilateral adrenal tumor.\nDocument [12]: Title: Iatrogenic Cushing Syndrome And Hypertension In An Infant Girl Due To Use Of Nappy Rash Cream Containing A Potent Topical Steroid. Abstract: Eleven months old female patient presented to paediatric out patient with parents concerned about her facial swelling. Upon examination child's weight and height for age were normal on her percentiles, she had a cushingoid facies with plethoric cheeks (Figure-1,2) though generalized oedema was absent and there was centripetal obesity with some muscle wasting (Figure-3,4). Systemic examination was normal excluding blood pressure which was high for her age. Electrolytes and cortisol levels were normal. On further inquiry it was revealed that she had been using a nappy rash cream containing a potent steroid, i.e., fluticasone for 2 months and this was identified as a cause for her cushingoid features.\nDocument [13]: Title: APPLICATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL KNOWLEDGE TO THE UNCONVENTIONAL USE OF A RARELY USED ANAESTHETIC AGENT. Abstract: A 6 yr old 45 kg child with severe Cushinoid features was admitted to PICU with probable hypertensive encephalopathy. She presented with increasing headaches, vomiting and seizures becoming unresponsive with a GCS of 3. She was profoundly hypertensive and her cortisol levels were significantly elevated (>2000 nmol/L). Rapid reduction in cortisol levels was required to stabilise her condition prior to surgery. Etomidate is the only readily available intravenous preparation which reliably suppresses adrenocortical function. A continuous infusion was started at 2.5 mg/hr and escalated to 3.5 mg/hr to reduce cortisol levels to 200 nmol/L. Cortisol levels were monitored after 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr on starting and at regular intervals subsequently. Hydrocortisone 20 mg/m2/24 hr was introduced to balance the adrenal suppression and optimise cortisol levels to 200-800 nmol/L. Mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone became necessary, together with significant electrolyte replacement therapy. Surgery was delayed due to sepsis, and block and replace therapy was continued for a period of 3 weeks. During this time she experienced minimal sedative effects from the etomidate.\nDocument [14]: Title: Cortisol-Producing Adrenocortical Carcinoma Presenting with Hypertensive Emergency. Abstract: BACKGROUND Hypertensive crisis is a relatively common condition often due to uncontrolled essential hypertension, but also potentially driven by one of many possible secondary etiologies. In this report, we detail a case of new-onset resistant hypertension leading to hypertensive emergency complicated by myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure secondary to underlying cortisol-producing metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old woman with no past medical history presented with generalized weakness and weight gain. Her blood pressure was 239/141 with a pulse of 117. Other vital signs were normal. A physical exam was notable for obesity and lower-extremity edema. Initial serum investigations were notable for leukocytosis, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated troponin and BNP. An ECG showed anterolateral ST depression and left ventricular hypertrophy. A coronary angiogram revealed no coronary artery disease. Her ejection fraction was 25% by echocardiogram. Further investigation revealed severely elevated serum cortisol levels. CT scans were notable for left adrenal mass with evidence of hepatic, lung, and bone metastasis. A liver biopsy confirmed metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma. The patient was started on antihypertensives and a steroidogenesis inhibitor, with improvement in her blood pressure. She received palliative chemotherapy but later elected to pursue hospice care. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the potential for underlying cortisol excess and adrenocortical carcinoma as a potential secondary etiology of resistant hypertension and hypertensive crisis. Due to the aggressive nature of this tumor, as demonstrated in this patient, a high index of suspicion and prompt attention are required for patients presenting with these clinical manifestations.\nDocument [15]: Title: Pituitary apoplexy associated with cortisol-induced hyperglycemia and acute delirium. Abstract: Pituitary apoplexy indicates pituitary adenoma hemorrhage, which could result in acute pituitary insufficiency and mortality. The typical symptoms are headache, visual disturbance, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and panhypopituitarism. However, cortisol-induced hyperglycemia and acute delirium could be an initial presentation of a pituitary adenoma hemorrhage with stormy release of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone. A 28-year-old woman presented with severe vomiting, irritable state, and delusion. She had medical history of irregular menstrual cycles and marked body weight gain after her second childbirth 8 years ago. She was diagnosed of diabetic ketoacidosis 2 days before this visiting at local medical department. On physical examination, Cushing appearance without definite neurological deficit was disclosed. Further blood tests revealed high blood sugar, cortisol, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels without evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis. The brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed pituitary macroadenoma and pituitary hemorrhage. Cushing disease with pituitary apoplexy was then diagnosed. Conservative management with delayed neurosurgery was applied. The patient became clear with normalized cortisol and blood sugar levels soon after. Follow-up computed tomography scan of the brain revealed no progression of tumor bleeding or mass effect. To our knowledge, pituitary apoplexy associated with cortisol-induced hyperglycemia and acute delirium has never been reported before. This case reminds us of pituitary apoplexy and its rare manifestations.\nDocument [16]: Title: Unilateral adrenalectomy partially improved hyperglycemia in a patient with primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. Abstract: Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) is characterized by bilateral multiple adrenal macro-nodules that often cause mild over-secretion of cortisol in the form of subclinical Cushing's syndrome. We herein describe a case, wherein unilateral adrenalectomy partially improved hyperglycemia in a patient with PBMAH and suggest the usefulness and limitations of this surgical strategy. A 64-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes had an incidental diagnosis of bilateral adrenal lesions. She had a family history of type 2 diabetes, and her HbA1c level was 8.9% under insulin therapy. She did not present with any symptoms associated with Cushing's syndrome. The basal cortisol level was in the normal range (12.0&#160;&#956;g/dL); however, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was suppressed (2.1&#160;pg/mL) and the serum cortisol level was not suppressed in the dexamethasone test. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral adrenal macro-nodules and <sup>131</sup>I-adosterol accumulated in the bilateral adrenal lesions. Collectively, she was diagnosed with subclinical Cushing's syndrome due to PBMAH complicated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed, and the pathologic findings were consistent with PBMAH. After unilateral adrenalectomy, serum cortisol levels decreased, and hypertension improved. Both HbA1c levels and insulin requirement also decreased, but insulin therapy was continuously needed. It should be noted that hyperglycemia may not be cured after successful surgery in a patient with PBMAH. Additional operation or medical therapy should be considered if unilateral adrenalectomy is unable to correct hypercortisolism in PBMAH patients.\nDocument [17]: Title: Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome in a case of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis treated with oral itraconazole and inhaled budesonide. Abstract: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> that occurs in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. Here, we report a case of a young female with bronchial asthma who presented to our hospital with worsening breathlessness on exertion. She was diagnosed to have ABPA and was initiated on oral itraconazole while continuing inhaled long acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist and medium dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for her asthma. Three months after initiation of therapy, the patient had significant improvement in breathlessness. However, she had weight gain, facial puffiness, increased facial hair and development of striae on her inner thighs, calf and lower abdomen. Her serum cortisol levels were found to be suppressed and hence a diagnosis of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome was made. Our case describes the potentially serious interaction between ICS and oral itraconazole, a treatment very commonly prescribed in patients with ABPA.\nDocument [18]: Title: Resolution of Metabolic Disorders and Overweight in a Patient with ACTH-independent Cushing's Syndrome after Unilateral Adrenalectomy. Abstract: Excessive production of cortisol by abnormal adrenocortical tissue causes clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome and is associated with metabolic abnormalities including abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which increase the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as vascular morbidity and mortality. Removing the cause of hypercortisolism is initially required to resolve metabolic disorders in patients with adrenal Cushing's syndrome. A 38-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which were not well controlled by medications, complained of abdominal obesity, rounded face, thin limbs, and bruising. Based on clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, she was diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome due to unilateral cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma. After left adrenalectomy, the patient's blood glucose improved to a satisfactory level, and she rapidly discontinued insulin and oral glucose-lowering agent therapy. Her body mass index decreased to the normal range, and her other metabolic symptoms, dyslipidemia and hypertension, also improved significantly. She has maintained resolution of metabolic disorders and overweight for eight years since surgery without recurrence of Cushing's syndrome.\nDocument [19]: Title: [Clinical value of serum cortisol determination (a literature review)]. Abstract: The generalization of the results of a considerable body of papers on the use of cortisol as an adaptation hormone allows one to conclude that the negative moments of life and health in human beings, including children, are followed by a reduction in its serum values and the moments of stressful situations of a healthy organism are attended by an increase in its serum levels. The data available in the literature on serum cortisol determination in diseases, including infectious diseases, suggest that the mild, uncomplicated, and acute forms of the disease without a history of prior premorbid conditions run mainly with the elevated serum levels of cortisol and the severe, complicated, lingering, and chronic ones in the presence of comorbidity with lowered cortisol values. It is concluded that serum cortisol measurement is an informative test for the health of a human being, his/her adaptation to the environment and, in case of disease, a test to predict its exacerbation and outcome, which allows therapy to be corrected in proper time.\nDocument [20]: Title: A case of adrenal Cushing's syndrome with bilateral adrenal masses. Abstract: A functional lesion in corticotrophin (ACTH)-independent Cushing's syndrome is difficult to distinguish from lesions of bilateral adrenal masses. Methods for distinguishing these lesions include adrenal venous sampling and (131)I-6\u03b2-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol ((131)I-NP-59) scintigraphy. We present a case of a 29-year-old Han Chinese female patient with a history of hypercholesterolaemia and polycystic ovary syndrome. She presented with a 6month history of an 8kg body weight gain and gradual rounding of the face. Serial examinations revealed loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol, elevated urinary free-cortisol level and undetectable ACTH level (<5pg/mL). No suppression was observed in both the low- and high-dose dexamethasone suppression tests. Adrenal computed tomography revealed bilateral adrenal masses. Adrenal venous sampling was performed, and the right-to-left lateralisation ratio was 14.29. The finding from adrenal scintigraphy with NP-59 was consistent with right adrenal adenoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy, and the pathology report showed adrenocortical adenoma. Her postoperative cortisol level was 3.2\u03bcg/dL, and her Cushingoid appearance improved. In sum, both adrenal venous sampling and (131)I-NP-59 scintigraphy are good diagnostic methods for Cushing's syndrome presenting with bilateral adrenal masses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Osteosarcomas are a type of bone cancer that typically affect young adults, often in the bones of the arms and legs. To treat osteosarcoma, doctors typically use a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, with External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) being the most commonly used form of radiotherapy. EBRT involves directing high-energy photons, X-rays, gamma rays, protons, and electrons at the tumor to induce cancer cell death. Additionally, healthcare providers use imaging techniques to monitor treatment success. This literature review aims to explore the relationship between osteosarcomas and EBRT, investigate the impact of the delayed diagnosis on survival rates, and examine the effectiveness of innovative uses of EBRT for treating osteosarcomas in unusual locations using comprehensive diagnostic techniques. To achieve these objectives, the review examines case studies and literary analyses and categorizes them based on the delay between symptom onset and diagnosis. The null hypothesis is that the presence or absence of a delay in diagnosis does not significantly impact outcomes for the \"Delay\" category. A lack of delay results in a more favorable outcome in the \"Lack of Delay\" category. However, the data and statistical results suggest that additional follow-up care in patients with rare or commonly recurring cancers could benefit outcomes. It is important to note that due to the rarity of osteosarcoma with EBRT, the small sample size in the studies warrants further investigation. Interestingly, many patients presented with head and neck tumors despite the most common location of osteosarcoma being in the long bones.\nDocument [2]: Title: Bone Tumors: Primary Bone Cancers. Abstract: The three most common primary bone cancers are osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. Osteosarcoma occurs most often in children and young adults, with a peak incidence at ages 10 to 14 years. It also can occur later in life due to malignant transformation of benign bone lesions. Osteosarcoma occurs most commonly around the knee, but can occur in other bones. Management varies depending on tumor characteristics and involves chemotherapy and surgery. Ewing sarcoma is most common in teenagers. It occurs most commonly in long bones but can occur in the pelvis and other bones. Management involves surgical resection when possible, along with chemotherapy and occasionally radiation therapy. Chondrosarcoma typically occurs in patients 40 years and older. It can occur as a primary tumor or from malignant transformation of benign bone tumors. Chondrosarcomas are relatively resistant to chemoradiation, so surgery is the standard therapy. When any of these tumors is suspected, patients should be instructed to avoid weight-bearing on the affected extremity to help prevent pathologic fracture while evaluation is completed. Imaging with x-rays and occasionally magnetic resonance imaging study are the initial diagnostic steps. If imaging suggests a primary bone cancer, prompt referral to an orthopedic oncology subspecialist is indicated.\nDocument [3]: Title: Clinicopathologic characteristics and survival of patients with bone metastasis in Yazd, Iran: a cross-sectional retrospective study. Abstract: To evaluate the clinico-pathological and survival characteristics in patients with bone metastasis. This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with bone metastasis who referred to Shahid Ramezanzadeh radiation oncology center. For all of the patients studied, demographic and survival information was recorded. SPSS was used to analyze the data. In this study, 89 men (53.3%) and 78 women (46.7%) with bone metastasis were examined. Most of the patients were in the 66 to 87 age range. Breast cancer was the most common type of cancer in women and prostate cancer was the commonest in men. In most patients, pain was the first manifestation of the disease, and the spine has been most frequently involved areas. The disease was diagnosed by isotope bone scan in the most cases. The mean survival was 31.1 months for patients with breast cancer, 12.9 months for patients with prostate cancer, 13.7 months for patients with lung cancer and the overall survival was 22.5. There was only a meaningful correlation between sex, type of cancer, radiation dose, and survival in patients. We found that age was more effective than the variable of cancer type in survival of patients with bone metastasis. The prognosis of patients with bone metastasis in our center is fair. There was a significant correlation between sex, type of cancer, radiation dose, and survival. Cox proportional hazards model showed that age was a predictor of death.\nDocument [4]: Title: Advances in the study of biomarkers related to bone metastasis in breast cancer. Abstract: Breast cancer is by far the most common malignancy in females. And bone is the most common site of distant metastasis in breast cancer, accounting for about 65 to 75% of all metastatic breast cancer patients.<sup>1,2</sup>Bone metastasis is an important factor affecting the prognosis of breast cancer. When patients have early-stage breast cancer without metastasis, their 5-year survival rate is as high as 90%, and once metastasis occurs, their 5-year survival rate will drop to 10%.<sup>3</sup> Bone radionuclide imaging (ECT), X-ray, CT scan, MRI and other imaging tests to diagnose breast cancer bone metastasis are commonly used in clinical, It is currently believed that breast cancer bone metastasis is a multistep process: first, breast cancer cells need to acquire invasive and metastatic properties; breast cancer cells enter the blood circulation and migrate from blood breast cancer cells enter the blood circulation and migrate from blood vessels to bone tissue in a targeted manner; breast cancer cells adhere and remain in bone tissue and colonise it; and finally, it leads to bone destruction.<sup>4</sup> Several key molecules are involved in breast cancer bone metastasis, and serum biomarkers are generally able to detect pathological changes earlier Several key molecules are involved in breast cancer bone metastasis, and serum biomarkers are generally able to detect pathological changes earlier than imaging.<sup>5</sup> This review describes the progress of serum biomarkers for breast cancer bone metastasis.\nDocument [5]: Title: Postmenopausal Breast Cancer, Aromatase Inhibitors, and Bone Health: What the Surgeon Should Know. Abstract: Breast cancer, as the most common malignancy in women, remains a major public health issue despite countless advances across decades. Endocrine therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of the hormone-sensitive subtype of breast cancer. The use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in the postmenopausal women has extended the survival beyond that of Tamoxifen, but harbors a subset of side effects, most notably accelerated bone loss. This, however, does not occur in all women undergoing treatment. It is vital to identify susceptible patients early, to limit such events, employ early treatment thereof, or alter drug therapy. International trials on AIs, predominantly performed in North American and European females, provide little information on what to expect in women in developing countries. Here, surgeons often prescribe and manage endocrine therapy. The prescribing surgeon should be aware of the adverse effect of the endocrine therapy and be able to attend to side effects. This review highlights clinical and biochemical factors associated with decrease in bone mineral density in an, as yet, unidentified subgroup of postmenopausal women. In the era of personalized medical care, appropriate management of bone health by surgeons based on these factors becomes increasingly important.\nDocument [6]: Title: The rise of metastatic bone disease in Ireland. Abstract: To describe the expected rise of metastatic bone disease in Ireland, the relative primary types, and the locations of spread within the skeleton. This was a population-based epidemiological study using cancer registry data. We included patients with known metastatic cancer to bone, within 1 year of the primary diagnosis, during the years 1994 to 2012 inclusive. Our main outcome measures were age-specific, gender-specific and age-standardised incidence rates of bone metastasis, primary types and metastatic location within the skeleton. There were 14,495 recognised cases of bone metastasis in Ireland, 1994-2012 inclusive. Cases consistently rose over the time period, with 108% case increase and 51% age-standardised incidence rise. Annual percentage change increased across both genders and over all age groups. Most of this rise was not due to demographic population change. Breast, prostate and lung accounted for the majority of primary types. GI cancers were the fourth most common primary type. There were proportional increases in breast and lung, with proportional decreases in prostate. The spine was the major metastatic site. Bone metastasis is a significant and rising healthcare concern in Ireland. This rise is disproportionate to demographic changes. Breast, prostate and lung cancers account for the majority. GI cancers are implicated in an unexpectedly high number of cases. Spine is the most common location of bony metastasis, especially at presentation. Prudent healthcare planning is necessitated to prepare for the growing consequences of bone metastasis in cancer patients.\nDocument [7]: Title: Approach to the prostate cancer patient with bone disease. Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most common visceral malignancy in men. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used in patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and is associated with significant bone loss and fractures. The greatest bone loss occurs during initiation of ADT. Men should have assessment of skeletal integrity with bone mineral density examination by dual x-ray absorptiometry of the hip and spine. Men with fragility fractures or osteoporosis by bone density should be considered for bisphosphonate therapy. Men with low bone mass may need antiresorptive therapy, depending on other risk factors. Men with a normal bone mineral density should be followed up closely with bone densitometry while on ADT. All men should receive preventive measures with calcium (1200 mg daily in divided doses), vitamin D (800-1000 IU/d), and weight-bearing exercise. Men should be evaluated for additional secondary causes of bone loss including vitamin D insufficiency. Guidelines are needed for androgen-induced bone loss screening and treatment.\nDocument [8]: Title: Bone Cancer: Diagnosis and Treatment Principles. Abstract: Primary bone cancers include osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. They account for less than 1% of diagnosed cancers each year and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis is challenging because of late patient presentation, nonspecific symptoms that mimic common musculoskeletal injuries, and low suspicion by physicians. Plain radiography is the preferred diagnostic test. Radiographic suspicion of a bone malignancy should prompt quick referral to a cancer center for multidisciplinary care. Osteosarcoma, the most common bone cancer, most often occurs in children and adolescents. It typically develops in the metaphysis of long bones, specifically the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. Metastasis to the lungs is common. Use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, in combination with surgery, has improved survival rates to nearly 80% for patients with localized disease, and 90% to 95% of patients do not require limb amputation. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone cancer and is similar to osteosarcoma in terms of presenting symptoms, age at occurrence, and treatment. Prognosis for osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma depends on the presence of metastasis, which lowers the five-year survival rate to 20% to 30%. Chondrosarcoma is the rarest bone cancer, primarily affecting adults older than 40 years. Survival rates are higher because most of these tumors are low-grade lesions.\nDocument [9]: Title: Understanding treatments for bone loss and bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer: a practical review and guide for the clinician. Abstract: Prostate cancer patients are at risk for developing bone loss and bone metastases. Clinicians prescribing ADT should appreciate the potential effects of ADT on BMD as well as the morbidity and mortality that can result from osteoporotic fractures. Measures to address the evaluation of patients and when to treat patients with significant bone loss have been discussed. Bisphosphonates effectively prevent loss of BMD in prostate cancer patients. Treatment of prostate cancer patients with established bone metastases with zoledronic acid should be considered strongly based on the results of the Saad study and other studies of patients with bone metastases with other malignancies. Zoledronic acid is approved by the US FDA for use in men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer and in the European Union for any patient with bone metastases, including prostate cancer patients,because of the beneficial impact of zoledronic acid on skeletal-related events. There is no validated method to determine which patients might benefit most from bisphosphonate therapy in this setting. Many questions about the use of bisphosphonate therapy in men with prostate cancer must be addressed, both in terms of the use in bone loss and bone metastases. These questions include: What is the optimal timing of therapy? Which bisphosphonate is best? What is the best dose and dose schedule? Do bisphosphonates effectively decrease skeletal fracture rates in patients with osteoporosis? How long should patients receive therapy? Are bisphosphonate \"holidays\" warranted? What are the long-term skeletal and renal toxicities? Is there a role for sequencing bisphosphonate therapy either before or after chemotherapy? Is bisphosphonate therapy synergistic with certain chemotherapy or other bone-targeted therapies? Which patients are the most likely to benefit from bisphosphonate therapy? What are clinically significant endpoints of bisphosphonate trials in patients with metastatic disease? Does inhibiting bone turnover also inhibit formation of bone metastases? Preliminary work in these areas has been completed, but more questions than answers are available. Given the rising costs of health care, it is imperative that these questions be addressed to best use the health care dollar while offering high-risk patients the best available therapy. At present, no data suggest that bisphosphonates should be used routinely to prevent BMD loss in men with normal BMD or to prevent the development of bone metastases in men with biochemical relapse. Continuing trials may give us guidance in the future.\nDocument [10]: Title: Acrometastases. Abstract: Metastases distal to the elbow and the knee (acrometastases) are rare, accounting for approximately 0.1 % of all cases. Acrometastases can appear in patients of every age, with men being twice as likely as women to be affected. The most common primary cancer site is the lung (>50 %), followed by the colon, breast and genito-urinary tract. They mainly appear in cancer patients with wide-spread disseminated disease. Rarely, they may be the first presentation of occult silent cancer, mimicking a benign condition. Current evidence supports that the tumor cells reach the bones of the hands through the circulation and not the lymphatic system; the malignant cells from the lungs have an easy access through the arterial circulation of the arms. The rare incidence of foot acrometastases is believed to be due to the lack of red marrow in these bones, a further distance from the primary cancer site, and the valveless paravertebral venous plexuses (Batson's plexuses), which allow retrograde tumor cell embolization through the iliofemoral venous system. Treatment depends on staging and tumor extent. Amputative surgery is the more common approach, especially for cancers with poor response to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In the majority of cases, disarticulation of the ray is required to achieve wide margin resection. In the foot, amputation can be that of a ray, midfoot or transtibial, depending on the location and spread of the tumor. If unresectable, palliative treatment with radiation therapy, bisphosphonates and chemotherapy is recommended. The prognosis of the patients with acrometastatic cancer is poor; the mean survival time after diagnosis is <6 months. An exception seems to be the patients with renal cell carcinoma, if treated with radical surgical resection, and a long latency period between nephrectomy and metastasis has occurred.\nDocument [11]: Title: Human Immune System Increases Breast Cancer-Induced Osteoblastic Bone Growth in a Humanized Mouse Model without Affecting Normal Bone. Abstract: Bone metastases are prevalent in many common cancers such as breast, prostate, and lung cancers, and novel therapies for treating bone metastases are needed. Human immune system-engrafted models are used in immuno-oncology (IO) studies for subcutaneous cancer cell or patient-derived xenograft implantations that mimic primary tumor growth. Novel efficacy models for IO compounds on bone metastases need to be established. The study was performed using CIEA NOG (NOG) mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (huNOG) and age-matched immunodeficient NOG mice. Bone phenotyping was performed to evaluate baseline differences. BT-474 human breast cancer cells were inoculated into the tibia bone marrow, and cancer-induced bone changes were monitored by X-ray imaging. Bone content and volume were analyzed by dual X-ray absorptiometry and microcomputed tomography. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of immune checkpoint markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Bone phenotyping showed no differences in bone architecture or volume of the healthy bones in huNOG and NOG mice, but the bone marrow fat was absent in huNOG mice. Fibrotic areas were observed in the bone marrow of some huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors induced osteoblastic bone growth. Bone lesions appeared earlier and were larger, and bone mineral density was higher in huNOG mice. huNOG mice had a high number of human CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells in immune-related organs. A low number of TILs and PD-1-positive cells and low PD-L1 expression were observed in the BT-474 tumors at the endpoint. This study reports characterization of the first breast cancer bone growth model in huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors represent a \"cold\" tumor with a low number of TILs. This model can be used for evaluating the efficacy of combination treatments of IO therapies with immune-stimulatory compounds or therapeutic approaches on bone metastatic breast cancer.\nDocument [12]: Title: Determination and biological relevance of serum cross-linked type I collagen N-telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase in breast metastatic cancer. Abstract: Bone metastasis is a frequent complication of cancer disease. The metastatic spread of cancer to bone is common to many different malignancies, particularly breast (ca. 73%), prostate (ca. 68%) and lung (ca. 36%) cancers. Metastases to bone cause increased bone resorption both from direct effects of the tumor itself and thought osteoclastic activation. The diagnosis and follow-up of bone metastatic cancer patients usually relies on skeletal X-ray and bone scintigraphy. However, the development of biochemical markers, used as indicators of bone metabolism, provides data useful in the clinical practice. The most important markers for bone remodeling process, bone formation and resorption, are bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx), respectively. In this report, we applied two solid-phase immunoassays used for the determination of BAP and NTx in serum of breast cancer (BC) post-menopausal women with bone metastasis and healthy individuals. BAP level in patients was found to be 45.72 +/- 12.92 U/l, while the normal range for healthy individuals was 14.2 - 42.7 U/l. The respective level of serum NTx was 19.20 +/- 8.87 nM bone collagen equivalents (BCE) for patients and 15.9 +/- 3.8 nM BCE for healthy women. Correlation of the obtained data showed elevated levels for both markers indicating high rate of bone degradation in breast metastatic cancer.\nDocument [13]: Title: Classification, imaging, biopsy and staging of osteosarcoma. Abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary osseous malignancy excluding malignant neoplasms of marrow origin (myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia) and accounts for approximately 20% of bone cancers. It predominantly affects patients younger than 20 years and mainly occurs in the long bones of the extremities, the most common being the metaphyseal area around the knee. These are classified as primary (central or surface) and secondary osteosarcomas arising in preexisting conditions. The conventional plain radiograph is the best for probable diagnosis as it describes features like sun burst appearance, Codman's triangle, new bone formation in soft tissues along with permeative pattern of destruction of the bone and other characteristics for specific subtypes of osteosarcomas. X-ray chest can detect metastasis in the lungs, but computerized tomography (CT) scan of the thorax is more helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lesion delineates its extent into the soft tissues, the medullary canal, the joint, skip lesions and the proximity of the tumor to the neurovascular structures. Tc99 bone scan detects the osseous metastases. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is used for metastatic workup and/or local recurrence after resection. The role of biochemical markers like alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase is pertinent for prognosis and treatment response. The biopsy confirms the diagnosis and reveals the grade of the tumor. Enneking system for staging malignant musculoskeletal tumors and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems are most commonly used for extremity sarcomas.\nDocument [14]: Title: [Cancer-related bone pain in children]. Abstract: Pain often discloses the existence of bone tumors in children. The complex physiopathology of pain in malignant bone tumors remains largely unknown and is currently investigated. Cancer-related bone pain is independent from the type and the location of the tumor, and from the number and size of the malignant lesions. It does not necessarily increase with tumor growth. Pain, which is the most common early symptom of bone cancer, may also be present at every step of the disease. It may arise from postsurgery injury, side effects of chemo- or radiotherapy, tumor evolution, secondary sequels of treatments, phantom pain. Tumor eradication using cancer therapeutic strategies is the major etiological treatment option for bone cancer pain. Symptom control requires multidisciplinary medical management with drugs effective against bone lysis, analgesics, drugs with anti-neuropathic activity, as well as non-pharmacological techniques and psycho-social management. This psycho-social management must be tailored to the specific needs of teenagers who are particularly prone to this pathological manifestation. Measures to prevent the occurrence of residual chronic pain must be implemented, whereas children and their family should be clearly informed of the risks and of analgesic options available.\nDocument [15]: Title: The Burden of Metastatic Cancer-Induced Bone Pain: A Narrative Review. Abstract: Bone pain is one of the most common forms of pain reported by cancer patients with metastatic disease. We conducted a review of oncology literature to further understand the epidemiology of and treatment approaches for metastatic cancer-induced bone pain and the effect of treatment of painful bone metastases on the patient's quality of life. Two-thirds of patients with advanced, metastatic, or terminal cancer worldwide experience pain. Cancer pain due to bone metastases is the most common form of pain in patients with advanced disease and has been shown to significantly reduce patients' quality of life. Treatment options for cancer pain due to bone metastases include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, palliative radiation, bisphosphonates, denosumab, and opioids. Therapies including palliative radiation and opioids have strong evidence supporting their efficacy treating cancer pain due to bone metastases; other therapies, like bisphosphonates and denosumab, do not. There is sufficient evidence that patients who experience pain relief after radiation therapy have improved quality of life; however, a substantial proportion are nonresponders. For those still requiring pain management, even with available analgesics, many patients are undertreated for cancer pain due to bone metastases, indicating an unmet need. The studies in this review were not designed to determine why cancer pain due to bone metastases was undertreated. Studies specifically addressing cancer pain due to bone metastases, rather than general cancer pain, are limited. Additional research is needed to determine patient preferences and physician attitudes regarding choice of analgesic for moderate to severe cancer pain due to bone metastases.\nDocument [16]: Title: Paget disease of the bone: does it exist in Saudi Arabia? Abstract: Paget disease of the bone is a chronic disease characterized by accelerated bone turnover with abnormal repair leading to expansion, pain and deformities. The disease is common in the West, but little if any information is available on its existence in the Arab world, including Saudi Arabia. We present four cases of Saudi patients with Paget disease with variable presentations. The first case, a 63-year-old woman with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, presented with bone, shoulder and chest wall pain and foci of uptake in the ribs and skull that were thought to be metastases, indicating the possibility of diagnostic difficulty in a patient with history of malignancy. Bone biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Paget disease. The second case was a 47-year-old asymptomatic woman with an elevated alkaline phosphatase of 427 U/L, a common presentation but at an unusual age. Plain x-rays and bone scan confirmed the diagnosis. The third case was a 43-year-old man who presented with hearing impairment and right knee osteoarthritis, unusual presentations at a young age leading to a delay in diagnosis. The fourth case was a 45-year-old man who presented with sacroiliac pain and normal biochemical values, including a normal alkaline phosphatase. Bone biopsy unexpectedly revealed features of Paget disease, which evolved over time into a classical form. A common feature in all except the first case was the relatively young age. Paget disease does exist in Saudi Arabia, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of similar cases.\nDocument [17]: Title: Bone metastasis is associated with acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype and immune suppression in a model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis. Abstract: The most common site of breast cancer metastasis is the bone, occurring in approximately 70% of patients with advanced disease. Bone metastasis is associated with severe morbidities and high mortality. Therefore, deeper understanding of the mechanisms that enable bone-metastatic relapse are urgently needed. We report the establishment and characterization of a bone-seeking variant of breast cancer cells that spontaneously forms aggressive bone metastases following surgical resection of primary tumor. We characterized the modifications in the immune milieu during early and late stages of metastatic relapse and found that the formation of bone metastases is associated with systemic changes, as well as modifications of the bone microenvironment towards an immune suppressive milieu. Furthermore, we characterized the intrinsic changes in breast cancer cells that facilitate bone-tropism and found that they acquire mesenchymal and osteomimetic features. This model provides a clinically relevant platform to study the functional interactions between breast cancer cells and the bone microenvironment, in an effort to identify novel targets for intervention.\nDocument [18]: Title: Radioisotopes for the palliation of metastatic bone cancer: a systematic review. Abstract: Strontium-89 and samarium-153 are radioisotopes that are approved in the USA and Europe for the palliation of pain from metastatic bone cancer, whereas rhenium-186 and rhenium-188 are investigational. Radioisotopes are effective in providing pain relief with response rates of between 40% and 95%. Pain relief starts 1-4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, continues for up to 18 months, and is associated with a reduction in analgesic use in many patients. Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are the most common toxic effects, but they are generally mild and reversible. Repeat doses are effective in providing pain relief in many patients. The effectiveness of radioisotopes can be greater when they are combined with chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin. Some studies with 89Sr and 153Sm indicate a reduction of hot spots on bone scans in up to 70% of patients, and suggest a possible tumoricidal action. Further studies are needed to address the questions of which isotope to use, what dose and schedule to use, and which patients will respond.\nDocument [19]: Title: Bone metastases: assessment, management and treatment options. Abstract: Cancer cells from a primary tumour can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. Bone metastases are common in multiple myeloma, where 70-80% of patients have bone metastases at diagnosis. They are also a common feature in solid tumours such as breast, lung, prostate, thyroid and renal carcinomas. The median survival in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer is 24 months; 20% of patients survive for 5 years or more. Pain is the most common symptom of bone metastases, which can often be severe and difficult to control. This article will discuss normal bone physiology and explain the changes that occur when cancer cells spread to bone. It will outline the signs and symptoms of bone metastases and discuss patient assessment, symptom management and treatment options, including different bisphosphonates. The physical and psychological impact of bone metastases should not be underestimated and nurses are well placed to improve the quality of life of patients.\nDocument [20]: Title: The added challenges of bone metastases treatment in elderly patients. Abstract: Most cancers occur in those older than the age of 65 years. As the population of the world ages and life expectancies continue to increase, it is important to address treatment challenges for elderly patients. This narrative review details the challenges of palliative radiotherapy treatment for elderly patients with bone metastases. We begin with the definition of elderly and its appropriateness, outlining recent demographic data of patients with cancer. The current status of elderly participation in clinical trials is discussed by reviewing the recent literature and clinical trial data. Factors affecting enrolment of the elderly are assessed, with a focus on palliative radiotherapy trials, and what we can do to improve accrual in this data-driven setting. At present, there is a lack of level 1 evidence that evaluates the optimal treatment for elderly patients with bone metastases. Therefore, a review of safety and efficacy is given based on previously published reports. Palliative radiotherapy for elderly patients is a worthwhile treatment and should be recommended regardless of age, as supported by available evidence. Patient, family and physician concerns about physical burden may be reduced as single treatments (that often can be done in a single visit) are as beneficial as multiple treatments for painful bone metastases. In elderly patients, radiotherapy may even be the best treatment for these cases as opioid-related adverse events are amplified in this group and often dosages are more difficult to titrate. Clinicians should continue to encourage the enrolment of elderly patients on to clinical trials as these data form the basis of optimal treatment guidelines. Radiation oncologists are encouraged to reduce the physical burden for elderly patients by offering single treatments where appropriate and completing consultation, treatment simulation and treatment in a single clinical visit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Nutritional rickets has occasionally been described in children with lamellar ichthyosis, but their vitamin D endocrine status has not been described. We report 3 cases of vitamin D-deficiency rickets associated with ichthyosis in African children. A 13-month-old Nigerian boy with lamellar ichthyosis had rib beading, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and rachitic changes on radiographs. His rickets did not resolve with calcium therapy, and his 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was low. His rickets resolved with parenteral vitamin D treatment, but his skin did not improve. Topical 0.005% calcipotriene (an analog of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D that has been useful in treating adults with psoriasis) was similarly ineffective in improving the child's skin condition. An 8-year-old Nigerian boy with life-long skin findings consistent with lamellar ichthyosis had windswept deformity of the legs with rib beading and enlargement of the wrists and ankles. Radiographs showed active rickets, and the boy had an elevated alkaline phosphatase level and a decreased calcium level. Before knowing that his 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was low, he was treated with calcium and showed radiologic improvement. The skin did not improve with resolution of the rickets but did improve with unilateral topical application of 0.005% calcipotriene. A 7-year-old South African girl presented with progressive windswept deformities of the legs and a 4-year history of skin disease (and a skin biopsy consistent with X-linked ichthyosis). Radiographs and biochemical data confirmed active rickets. Her rickets improved dramatically with vitamin D treatment. Thus, 3 African children with ichthyosis developed vitamin D-deficiency rickets, probably because of a combination of impaired skin production and sunlight avoidance. This is consistent with previous findings of hypovitaminosis D in adults with ichthyosis and other disorders of keratinization. Measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be indicated in children with ichthyosis to identify those at risk for vitamin D-deficiency rickets, because it is possible that the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D in such children is impaired. Although the ichthyosis did not improve with resolution of vitamin D deficiency and rickets, 1 of 2 children treated with topical calcipotriene showed improvement in the treated areas of skin. Calcipotriene does not seem to be effective in reversing systemic vitamin D deficiency but can be effective in improving the severity of skin disease in children with ichthyosis.\nDocument [2]: Title: Mechanisms Involved in the Relationship between Vitamin D and Insulin Resistance: Impact on Clinical Practice. Abstract: Recent evidence has revealed anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D as well as extra-skeletal activity. In this context, vitamin D seems to be involved in infections, autoimmune diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and cancer development. In recent years, the relationship between vitamin D and insulin resistance has been a topic of growing interest. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels appear to be associated with most of the insulin resistance disorders described to date. In fact, vitamin D deficiency may be one of the factors accelerating the development of insulin resistance. Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in the population and may be associated with the pathogenesis of diseases related to insulin resistance, such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MS) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). An important question is the identification of 25(OH)D levels capable of generating an effect on insulin resistance, glucose metabolism and to decrease the risk of developing insulin resistance related disorders. The benefits of 25(OH)D supplementation/repletion on bone health are well known, and although there is a biological plausibility linking the status of vitamin D and insulin resistance supported by basic and clinical research findings, well-designed randomized clinical trials as well as basic research are necessary to know the molecular pathways involved in this association.\nDocument [3]: Title: The Role of Vitamin D in Reducing the Risk of Metabolic Disturbances That Cause Cardiovascular Diseases. Abstract: Among the most common problems facing public health today is a lack of vitamin D, which plays a role in the physiological processes of chronic illness conditions. Vitamin D deficiency in metabolic disorders has primary effects on osteoporosis, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vitamin D acts as a \"co-hormone\" in the various tissues of the body, and it has been found that vitamin D receptors (VDR) are present on all cell types, suggesting that vitamin D has a wide range of effects on most cells. Recently, there has been a surge in interest in assessing its roles. Vitamin D insufficiency increases the risk of diabetes because it lowers insulin sensitivity, and also raises the risk of obesity and CVD because of its effect on the body's lipid profile, particularly in terms of the prevalence of dangerously high levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Furthermore, vitamin D insufficiency is often related to CVD and connected risk factors, highlighting the need to know vitamin D's functions in relation to metabolic syndrome and related processes. Through looking at previous studies, this paper explains why vitamin D is important, how deficiency is related to risk factors for metabolic syndrome through different mechanisms, and how deficiency affects CVD.\nDocument [4]: Title: Vitamin D and autoimmune thyroid diseases: facts and unresolved questions. Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency (levels lower than 20 ng/ml) is becoming a global health problem, since it is increasingly represented even among healthy subjects. Vitamin D, as an environmental factor, is involved in many biological processes, like perception of chronic pain and response to infections. In recent years, evidence has emerged pointing to an involvement of vitamin D in the development of many autoimmune diseases, and a severe vitamin D deficiency has been especially demonstrated in patients affected with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Low levels of vitamin D were found associated with antithyroid antibody presence, abnormal thyroid function, increased thyroid volume, increased TSH levels, and adverse pregnancy outcome in women with AITD. Vitamin D mediates its effect through binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is harbored on many human immune cells, and in this way is able to modulate immune cells activity, triggering both innate and adaptive immune responses. As VDR gene polymorphisms were found to associate with AITD, the evidence links vitamin D deficiency to AITD either through gene polymorphism or by environmental factors (lack of dietary uptake and sun exposure). Vitamin D supplementation may be offered to AITD patients, but further research is needed to define whether it should be introduced in clinical practice.\nDocument [5]: Title: Vitamin D Binding Protein and the Biological Activity of Vitamin D. Abstract: Vitamin D has a long-established role in bone health. In the last two decades, there has been a dramatic resurgence in research interest in vitamin D due to studies that have shown its possible benefits for non-skeletal health. Underpinning the renewed interest in vitamin D was the identification of the vital role of intracrine or localized, tissue-specific, conversion of inactive pro-hormone 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D]. This intracrine mechanism is the likely driving force behind vitamin D action resulting in positive effects on human health. To fully capture the effect of this localized, tissue-specific conversion to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, adequate 25(OH)D would be required. As such, low serum concentrations of 25(OH)D would compromise intracrine generation of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D within target tissues. Consistent with this is the observation that all adverse human health consequences of vitamin D deficiency are associated with a low serum 25(OH)D level and not with low 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D concentrations. Thus, clinical investigators have sought to define what concentration of serum 25(OH)D constitutes adequate vitamin D status. However, since 25(OH)D is transported in serum bound primarily to vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and secondarily to albumin, is the total 25(OH)D (bound plus free) or the unbound free 25(OH)D the crucial determinant of the non-classical actions of vitamin D? While DBP-bound-25(OH)D is important for renal handling of 25(OH)D and endocrine synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, how does DBP impact extra-renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and subsequent 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D actions? Are their pathophysiological contexts where total 25(OH)D and free 25(OH)D would diverge in value as a marker of vitamin D status? This review aims to introduce and discuss the concept of free 25(OH)D, the molecular biology and biochemistry of vitamin D and DBP that provides the context for free 25(OH)D, and surveys <i>in vitro</i>, animal, and human studies taking free 25(OH)D into consideration.\nDocument [6]: Title: Vitamin D deficiency: A Public Health Issue in High- and Low-Income Countries or Just Hype? Abstract: Globally, there has been increasing attention being paid to the problem of micronutrient malnutrition, especially as contrary to previous thinking, it is not uniquely the concern of poor countries. While, in general, micronutrient deficiencies are certainly more frequent and severe among disadvantaged populations, they also present a public health problem in some industrialized countries. Vitamin D deficiency is a good example, as it is certainly prevalent in some upper-middle to high-income countries, arising due to a lack of ultraviolet B (UVB) sunshine availability for anything from 2 to 8 months of the year. Furthermore, current population dietary vitamin D intakes do not compensate for the lack of vitamin D synthesis in the skin during this \"vitamin D winter\" period. It has been suggested that micronutrient deficiencies (sometimes referred to as \"hidden hunger\") is a major public health problem in developing countries. Whether vitamin D deficiency is one of these hidden hunger component deficiencies is an important question and worthy of consideration. This short chapter will highlight data to suggest that vitamin D deficiency may be evident in vulnerable groups (women of child-bearing age, infants, and young children) within several, but certainly not all, lower-middle and low-income countries (LMICs), despite the fact that many of these countries are generally sun-rich locations for significant parts of the year. However, despite this ample UVB availability, vitamin D deficiency in these LMICs arises due to one or more underlying reasons, which include low exposure to this UVB-rich sunshine, skin pigmentation, air pollution, skin covering, and low vitamin D intakes. This chapter will highlight lessons learned from industrialized countries on how to address vitamin D deficiency via a foods-first approach, with consideration of their utility in LMICs.\nDocument [7]: Title: The effects of single high-dose or daily low-dosage oral colecalciferol treatment on vitamin D levels and muscle strength in postmenopausal women. Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency is a common health problem. Vitamin D supplements are used to improve vitamin D status; however, there are contradictory data related to what doses to give and how often they should be given. Many studies have investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength, but the results remain controversial. We aimed to compare the effects and safety of single high-dose with daily low-dose oral colecalciferol on 25(OH)D levels and muscle strength in postmenopausal women with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.\nDocument [8]: Title: [Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy : what's the local situation ?] Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem, also during pregnancy. Inadequate maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy is associated with poor fetal growth, impaired bone development and rickets in infants after birth. Furthermore, higher rates of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes are associated with low maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy. Toxicity of vitamin D is rare. Most countries recommend vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy but guidelines are controversial and inadequate compared to real mother's and child's needs. Wath's the best strategy to follow and supplement mother during pregnancy? In a study carried out at the maternity clinic Notre-Dame des Bruy\u00e8res (CHU Li\u00e8ge), we studied for a year the vitamin D concentrations of young women at start of pregnancy and of others after delivery to evaluate the local situation and management of vitamin D status during pregnancy. We did not collect the cord blood samples in this study. However, this is a project we would like to achieve soon. This would allow us to compare the vitamin D results of the mother at the time of delivery, to those of the cord blood of their respective child.\nDocument [9]: Title: Vitamin D for skeletal and non-skeletal health: What we should know. Abstract: Vitamin D plays an essential role in regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism and maintaining a healthy mineralized skeleton. Humans obtain vitamin D from sunlight exposure, dietary foods and supplements. There are two forms of vitamin D: vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and vitamin D<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is synthesized endogenously in the skin and found naturally in oily fish and cod liver oil. Vitamin D<sub>2</sub> is synthesized from ergosterol and found in yeast and mushrooms. Once vitamin D enters the circulation it is converted by 25-hydroxylase in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which is further converted by the 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1&#945;-hydroxylase in the kidneys to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D]. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D binds to its nuclear vitamin D receptor to exert its physiologic functions. These functions include: promotion of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, renal tubular calcium reabsorption, and calcium mobilization from bone. The Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline defines vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency as serum concentrations of 25(OH)D of &lt;20&#8239;ng/mL, 21-29&#8239;ng/mL, and 30-100&#8239;ng/mL, respectively. Vitamin D deficiency is a major global public health problem in all age groups. It is estimated that 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. This pandemic of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is attributed to a modern lifestyle and environmental factors that restrict sunlight exposure, which is essential for endogenous synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of rickets and osteomalacia, and can exacerbate osteoporosis. It is also associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain, muscle weakness, and an increased risk of falling. In addition, several observational studies observed the association between robust levels of serum 25(OH)D in the range of 40-60&#8239;ng/mL with decreased mortality and risk of development of several types of chronic diseases. Therefore, vitamin D-deficient patients should be treated with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> or vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation to achieve an optimal level of serum 25(OH)D. Screening of vitamin D deficiency by measuring serum 25(OH)D is recommended in individuals at risk such as patients with diseases affecting vitamin D metabolism and absorption, osteoporosis, and older adults with a history of falls or nontraumatic fracture. It is important to know if a laboratory assay measures total 25(OH)D or only 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. Using assays that measure only 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> could underestimate total levels of 25(OH)D and may mislead physicians who treat patients with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> supplementation.\nDocument [10]: Title: Vitamin D and Autoimmune Diseases: Is Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) Polymorphism the Culprit? Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency is becoming an increasing problem worldwide. It should not be underestimated, not only due to the well-known consequences vitamin D deficiency has on bone health, but primarily because recent studies have shown how the biologically active form of vitamin D - 1,25(OH)2D - is involved in many biological processes, including immune system modulation. Moreover, the presence of a vitamin D receptor was discovered in almost all immune cells and some of its polymorphisms were found to be associated with increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. This finding led to a proposed link between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmune diseases. Patients affected by various autoimmune diseases showed low levels of vitamin D. However, it is not always clear whether vitamin D deficiency is the cause or rather a consequence of the disease. Limitations of the studies, such as the small number of patients, heterogeneity of selected groups, environmental conditions, methods used to measure vitamin D serum concentration and other confounding factors do not lead to unequivocal results to demonstrate a direct link between low vitamin D levels and autoimmune disease. Therefore, randomized trials are needed to clarify conflicting results.\nDocument [11]: Title: 'Scientific Strabismus' or two related pandemics: coronavirus disease and vitamin D deficiency. Abstract: The WHO has announced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak to be a global pandemic. The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature and humidity, that is, similar to the behaviour of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections. COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern mid-latitude countries with an average temperature of 5\u201311\u00b0C and low humidity. Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in Europe. Regardless of age, ethnicity and latitude, recent data showed that 40 % of Europeans are vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50 nmol/l), and 13 % are severely deficient (25(OH)D < 30 nmol/l). A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and mid-latitude countries than the tropical and high-latitude countries. The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia 46 %; Qatar 46 %; Iran 33\u00b74 %; Chile 26\u00b74 %) and mid-latitude (France 27\u00b73 %; Portugal 21\u00b72 %; Austria 19\u00b73 %) regions. Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0 % in some high-latitude countries (e.g. Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands). Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19. Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.\nDocument [12]: Title: Vitamin D and kidney disease: what we know and what we do not know. Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency is common in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. CKD has been recognized as a significant public health problem and CKD patients are at increased risk of total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There are increasing epidemiological data suggesting that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in overall morbidity and mortality associated with CKD. The vitamin D hormonal system is classically implicated in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism but there is ample evidence to support the claim that extra renal conversion of 25(OH)D to 1.25(OH)2 has significant biological roles beyond those traditionally ascribed to vitamin D. Based on the current state of evidence this review intends to give an update on novel biological and clinical insights with relevance to the steroid hormone vitamin D specifically in patients with kidney disease.\nDocument [13]: Title: Comparative Clinical Effects and Risk Factors Associated With Vitamin D in Foot and Ankle Fracture and Arthrodesis Healing. Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency in relation to bone metabolism and healing has been controversial and not well studied. However, hypovitaminosis has been widely identified within the orthopedic patient population. The current best evidence suggests a lack of data on this important topic. The ability to assess patients for optimum bone healing and metabolism is still in question due to lack of a suitable reliable biomarker and multiple other unknown variables affecting bone metabolism. To compound this effect, popular dermatological precautions in the last 20 to 30 years of avoiding sunlight also have the effect of further reducing serum vitamin D production in the skin. As a proof of concept, we performed a preliminary comparative observational retrospective review of orthopedic patients undergoing fracture and arthrodesis osseous healing to determine how serum vitamin D levels are associated with bone healing along with their confounding comorbidities. Based on our review, the current accepted vitamin D levels (\u226520 ng/mL) are low and insufficient for fractures and for arthrodesis osseous healing due to observed high rates (>35%) of delayed unions, and an increased (>90%) in the number of multiple confounding comorbidities affecting bone healing process that are often not mentioned or captured in this type of study in previous literature. Obesity and diabetes are significant contributory risks factors, and the preliminary findings suggest that the current accepted adequate levels may not be enough for osseous healing. These low vitamin D levels appear to affect bone healing and prolong treatment, with worsening trends with diabetes and obesity comorbidities.\nDocument [14]: Title: Abstract: <b>Background</b> Vitamin D deficiency represents a global health problem, affecting children and adolescents worldwide. <b>Objects</b> To confirm that vitamin D deficiency can present as a spectrum of clinical pictures. <b>Methods</b> We diagnosed nutritional rickets in a 10-month-old infant of Senegal origin with several risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. As many of these factors affected also his cohabitant relatives, we evaluate infant's family members (mother and 4 brothers) looking for other vitamin D deficiency-related comorbidities. <b>Results</b> 3 brothers had asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency and 2 of them (9.8 and 13.4 years-old) showed secondary hyperparathyroidism. The fourth brother (11.3 years-old) had nutritional rickets. Their mother was affected by osteomalacia. None of them received vitamin D supplementation. <b>Conclusion</b> Vitamin D deficiency may present as a spectrum of clinical pictures, representing a continuum ranging from asymptomatic/subtle conditions to overt rickets/osteomalacia. Immigrant families are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency at every age. If a case of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency is recognized, then the evaluation of the all family members is recommended, as they can have the same and/or other risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.\nDocument [15]: Title: Dilemmas in Vitamin D Management in Children and Adolescents. Abstract: The importance of vitamin D and its role in several biological processes has been a topic of interest in recent years. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that is needed for metabolic bone health and for maintaining bone calcium homeostasis. It is primarily synthesized in the skin on exposure to sunlight. Of late, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with conditions such as obesity, poor control of asthma and other autoimmune diseases, which has led to questions about its potential role in causation and management of these conditions. Given the increase in data about this topic, providers may often have questions about whom to screen and what to tell patients. In this article, we address screening guidelines for vitamin D in children and adolescents, management of vitamin D deficiency, and current literature on the role of vitamin D in conditions such as obesity, asthma, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. [Pediatr Ann. 2019;48(8):e298-e303.].\nDocument [16]: Title: The role of vitamers and dietary-based metabolites of vitamin D in prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Abstract: There is little doubt that vitamin D deficiency across all age groups in Europe is a problem. Low vitamin D status arises due to limited, if any, dermal synthesis during the winter months at latitudes above 40\u00b0N, putting increased importance on dietary supply of the vitamin. However, dietary intakes by most populations are low due to the limited supply of vitamin D-rich foods in the food chain. Thus strategies that effectively address this public health issue are urgently required. It has been emphasized and re-emphasized that there are only a limited number of public health strategies available to correct low dietary vitamin D intake: (1) improving intake of naturally occurring vitamin D-rich foods, (2) vitamin D fortification (mandatory or voluntarily) of food, and (3) vitamin D supplementation. Recent evidence suggests that the levels of vitamin D added to food would need to be high so as to ensure dietary requirements are met and health outcomes optimized. In addition, knowledge of the most effective forms of vitamin D to use in some of these preventative approaches is important. There is still uncertainty in relation to the relative efficacy of vitamin D(2) versus D(3), the two main food derived forms and those used in vitamin D supplements. The major metabolite of vitamin D with biological activity is 1,25(OH)(2)D; however, this is usually used for pharmacological purposes and is not typically used in normal, healthy people. The other major metabolite, 25(OH)D, which has also been used for pharmacological purposes is present in certain foods such as meat and meat products (particularly offal) as well as eggs. This metabolite may have the potential to boost vitamin D status up to five times more effectively that native vitamin D(3) in foods. However, the exact bioactivity of this compound needs to be established.\nDocument [17]: Title: Vitamin D supplementation: when and how? Abstract: The multiple effects of vitamin D on skeletal and extra-skeletal tissues increased the attention of scientists and public to the possible relationship between hypovitaminosis D and a variety of acute and chronic diseases. However, several points are still largely debated. In particular, the definition of optimal vitamin D status [as assessed by the circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)] remains controversial, and experts still disagree about several related outcomes: how to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, when to start treatment, how to reach optimal 25(OH)D levels, which type of vitamin is preferable for supplementation, which dosing strategy is the better option. In this context, a matter of major debate is represented by the measurement of circulating level of 25(OH)D, whose determination is affected by the lack of standardization and by several technical problems. It has been recently hypothesized that free and bio-available, rather than total 25(OH)D, mostly determine its biological action. However, further evaluation of directly measured free 25(OH)D levels is needed, in order to establish its role in research and clinical practice. Finally, it is not yet defined if a threshold of optimal vitamin D status for reducing the risk of extra-skeletal diseases exists. Actually, it is plausible that the desired 25(OH)D level may vary widely, depending on the health outcome in question. However, this topic is uncertain, partly due to the lack of randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on extra-skeletal end-points.\nDocument [18]: Title: Vitamin D and prevention of osteoporosis: Japanese perspective. Abstract: Vitamin D insufficiency or a low vitamin D status, is a prevalent condition worldwide. However, there have been no studies addressing this public health issue until recently. In this review article, a summary of a series of studies conducted by the author and his colleagues to determine whether the vitamin D status of Japanese people is adequate and how their vitamin D status affects bone mass and bone metabolism is presented. The observational studies conducted by our group revealed that vitamin D insufficiency does not seem to be a serious problem among active elderly people, but that elderly people with a low level of activities of daily living (ADL) are at a very high risk of vitamin D insufficiency. In young adults, a high intact PTH concentration due to vitamin D insufficiency, which adversely affects their bone mass, is common, suggesting that vitamin D nutrition, as well as dietary calcium intake, should be improved. However, the effects of vitamin D insufficiency among elderly Japanese on bone metabolism, bone mass, and fractures have not been clarified, and should be studied further to determine whether specific preventive strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation, are required for this high-risk group. Intervention studies targeting Japanese populations are required to further address this issue.\nDocument [19]: Title: Vitamin D -- the sun hormone. Life in environmental mismatch. Abstract: While some representatives of the animal kingdom were improving their biological mechanisms and properties for adapting to ever-changing life conditions, the genus Homo was developing backward: human individuals were losing their adaptation to life areas conquered earlier. Losing step-by-step their useful traits including the body hair cover, the primitive genus Homo retained his viability only under very favorable conditions of the equatorial Africa. Protection from UV radiation danger was provided only by pigmentation of skin, hair, and eyes. However, \"impoverished\" individuals of this genus gained the ability to walk upright. Their hands became free from participation in movement and became fine tools for producing useful instruments, from the stone knife to the computer. The major consequence of upright movement and hand development became the powerful development of the brain. A modern human, Homo sapiens, appeared capable of conquering very diverse new habitats. The human's expansion on the Earth occurred somewhat limited by his dependence on vitamin D. His expansion into new areas with lower Sun activity was partially associated with the loss of skin pigmentation. But there is an open question, whether under these new conditions he is satisfactorily provided with vitamin D. This paper discusses the following problems: how can we ensure a sufficient intake of vitamin D, how much does an individual require for his existence and optimal life, what will be consequences of vitamin D deficiency, and what are the prospects for better provision with vitamin D?\nDocument [20]: Title: Vitamin D, light and mental health. Abstract: Vitamin D receptors and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes are present in the central nervous system. Calcitriol (the active vitamin D hormone) affects numerous neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors, relevant for mental disorders. In the case of depressive disorders, considerable evidence supports a role of suboptimal vitamin D levels. However, the data are not conclusive and further studies are necessary. Especially, the relative importance of the pineal-melatonin system versus the vitamin D-endocrine system for the pathogenesis of seasonal affective disorders is presently unresolved. Two diagnoses, schizophrenia and autism, have been hypothetically linked to developmental (prenatal) vitamin D deficiency, however, also in adult patients, low levels have been reported, supporting the notion that vitamin D deficiency may not only be a predisposing developmental factor but also relate to the adult patients' psychiatric state. Two cases are described, whose psychiatric improvement coincided with effective treatment of vitamin D deficiency.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: A 23-year-old woman, G0, presented to the emergency department with painful bruising of the legs shortly after starting an oral contraceptive pill. The presumed diagnosis was pill-induced ecchymosis, and she was instructed to discontinue the medication. Her bruising resolved. However, the working diagnosis was later questioned as the patient had used other oral contraceptive pills in the past without any adverse reaction. In addition, there is robust literature associating these medications with thrombosis, not bruising. The patient later disclosed that she had concomitantly started an oral hair supplement along with her oral contraceptive pill. Analysis of the supplement contents revealed that it contained extract of <i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>, a herbal anticoagulant, making this a much more plausible explanation for the ecchymosis. She then resumed the original oral contraceptive pill alone without any reaction. The case highlights how cognitive bias resulted in a misdiagnosis. Specifically, this case introduces the concept of <i>pill bias</i>, as the patient's unexplained bruising was presumed to be a result of her use of an oral contraceptive despite the lack of evidence to support this claim. This bias has the potential to impact clinical decision-making and lead to clinical errors.\nDocument [2]: Title: Bruises on the ears and body. Abstract: Over the course of a month, this 34-year-old woman had sought care at our facility--and another--on 3 separate occasions for painful bruises (visits #1 and #3) and deep vein thrombosis (visit #2). The bruises first appeared acutely on her arms, prompting her first visit to our ED and leading to a hospital stay. Several weeks later, the patient developed new bruise-like lesions on her earlobes, face, trunk, and lower extremities. In between these 2 visits, the patient was seen in another ED (and admitted) for right upper extremity DVT and was started on enoxaparin, followed by warfarin. The patient had no history of trauma, but did have a 7-year history of cocaine abuse. The initial bruises appeared one week after using cocaine from a different dealer. On her most recent visit, her vitals and physical examination were unremarkable, apart from the skin findings. Her complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and urinalysis were unremarkable. On her previous admissions, the patient's urine drug test had been positive for cocaine. She'd also tested positive for cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anti-double stranded DNA, and anticardiolipin IgM. WHAT IS YOUR DIAGNOSIS? HOW WOULD YOU TREAT THIS PATIENT?\nDocument [3]: Title: A rare cause of Dysphagia - Dysphagia aortica - complicated with intravascular disseminated coagulopathy. Abstract: Dysphagia aortica is an uncommon condition defined by the difficulty in swallowing caused by extrinsic compression of the esophagus due to an ectatic, tortuous, or aneurysmatic atherosclerotic thoracic aorta. We report the case of a 93 year old woman with dysphagia secondary to extrinsic compression by a giant sacciform aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta. As a consequence of small liniar dissection tracts of the aneurysm, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with spontaneous forearm hematoma and multiple bruising, a clinical setting with a difficult therapeutic approach. Taking into account that aneurysm of the thoracic aorta is a very rare cause of dysphagia, the case report on this rare cause should contribute to better diagnosis of dysphagia aortica and swallowing difficulties in general. Dissecting aneurysm of the thoracic aorta is a very rare cause of DIC so the combination of easy bruising or spontaneous hematoma and an aortic aneurysm demands special caution.\nDocument [4]: Title: Potential forensic implications of <i>kerokan</i> therapy - a traditional Indonesian therapy associated with neck bruising. Abstract: <i>Kerokan</i> is a traditional Indonesian treatment involving abrading the skin over various parts of the body with a blunt object such as a coin or a piece of ginger which may create suspicious injuries. Here, the case of a 30-year-old woman who had undergone <i>kerokan</i> therapy is reported. She was complaining of retro-sternal pain and epigastric discomfort and subsequently became markedly short of breath and died. The observation of injuries predominantly located around the neck initiated a police investigation and forensic autopsy. Scattered abrasions, blisters and bruises were present on the forehead, the bridge of the nose extending to the ala, the upper and anterior aspect of the chin and the sternal notch, with discrete fresh and scabbed abrasions around the neck, over the sternum and on the backs of both hands. There were, however, no facial or conjunctival petechiae and no bruising of the underlying strap muscles, or fractures of the hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage. Histology revealed that myocarditis was the cause of death. Traditional practices may cause unusual bruises, abrasions, blisters and burns that may raise suspicion of inflicted injury from an assault. Knowledge of the manifestations of socio-ethnic practices such as <i>kerokan</i> is important in the evaluation of trauma in specific cultural groups.\nDocument [5]: Title: Confusion recurs 2 weeks after fall. Abstract: A 77-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of a headache following a syncopal episode (while standing) earlier that day. She said that she'd lost consciousness for several minutes, and then experienced several minutes of mild confusion that resolved spontaneously. On physical exam, she was oriented to person and place, but not time. She had a contusion in her left occipitoparietal region without extensive bruising or deformity. The patient had normal cardiopulmonary, abdominal, and neurologic exams. Her past medical history included hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and her vital signs were within normal limits. She was taking aspirin once daily. The patient's initial head and neck computerized tomography (CT) scans were normal, but she was hospitalized because of her confusion. During her hospitalization, the patient had mild episodic headaches that resolved with acetaminophen. The next day, her confusion resolved, and repeat CT scans were unchanged. She was discharged within 24 hours. Two weeks later, the patient returned to the hospital after her daughter found her on the toilet, unable to stand up from the sitting position. She was confused and experienced a worsening of headache during transport to the hospital. No recurrent falls or additional episodes of trauma were reported. A CT scan was performed. WHAT IS YOUR DIAGNOSIS? HOW WOULD YOU TREAT THIS PATIENT?\nDocument [6]: Title: Child abuse: discovering the horrifying truth. Abstract: EMS is called to the residence of a 2-month-old child who's lethargic and has not eaten well for several days. On arrival, the grandmother of the patient states she's concerned because the child isn't acting right. During your assessment, you notice the child isn't acting age appropriate. Initial vital signs after placing the patient in the ambulance reveal: blood pressure 82/46, pulse 146 bpm, respirations 32 and a blood-glucose level of 134 mg/dL. Further assessment reveals bruising to the pinna of the right ear. On arrival at the emergency department (ED), the child begins to have periods of apnea, and the hospital healthcare providers intubate the patient. A post-intubation chest X-ray reveals multiple acute and sub-acute rib fractures. The ED staff exposed the patient during their assessment and noted bruising to the left ear and the jaw. There's also bruising found in different stages of healing to the anterior and posterior chest wall. The ED staff suspects this patient is a victim of child maltreatment, so the proper authorities are notified. During the investigation, the mother admits to abusing the child.\nDocument [7]: Title: Periodic painful purpura: fact or factitious? Abstract: A 60-year-old woman with multiple psychosocial issues presented with a history of spontaneous painful bruising on her left upper arm. Extensive investigations did not reveal any abnormality apart from an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time as a result of factor XII deficiency. An autoerythrocyte sensitization test reproduced the tender bruises on her back. Our patient reported relief of pain with promethazine injections. She was subsequently referred to the psychiatric team for ongoing assessment and management. Having an awareness of this rare condition will assist in the prevention of unnecessary investigation of such cases and will allow the early referral of patients for appropriate psychological counselling.\nDocument [8]: Title: Characteristics of bruises in carcasses of cows sourced from farms or from livestock markets. Abstract: Bruises in cattle develop after the application of force, and they provide evidence for sub-optimal animal welfare. The aim of this study was to describe the gross characteristics of bruises in cows arriving at the slaughterhouse directly from farms or through the livestock market. The number of bruises and their distribution on the carcass as well as their severity, shape, size and colour were assessed post mortem in a slaughterhouse in Chile. A total of 258 cow carcasses were evaluated, and a total of 846 bruises were found on 243 of the carcasses. Cows that had passed through a livestock market (M-carcasses) had in total 563 bruises (mean 3.8 bruises/carcass, s.d. 2.0), whereas cows transported directly from farms (F-carcasses) had in total 283 bruises (mean 2.5 bruises/carcass, s.d. 1.8). The backs of F-carcasses had twice as many bruises as M-carcasses (32.9% and 16.2%, respectively), whereas bruises in the rib area were more frequently observed in M-carcasses (13.1%) than in F-carcasses (8.1%). Superficial bruises (grade 1) were the most frequently observed (66.2% of all bruises). Regarding the size of the bruises, 64 (7.6%) were classified as large, 271 (32.0%) as medium and 511 (60.4%) as small. Irregularly shaped bruises were the most frequent (91.1%, n = 771), followed by linear (3.8%, n = 32), circular (3.1%, n = 26) and tramline-shaped bruises (1.9%, n = 16). The latter were noticed only in M-carcasses, which may indicate that these animals were beaten more frequently with sticks or other rod-shaped objects. Fresh, bright red-coloured bruises were found more frequently on all the animals (69.5% from farms and 70.5% from market) compared with bluish (29.7% and 29.3%, respectively) and yellow bruises (0.4% and 0.2%, respectively). The method of selling was significantly associated with the number of bruises on the carcass (P < 0.001) and the anatomical site (P < 0.05), but not with the severity, shape and colour of the bruises. Increased fat coverage reduced the severity of bruises (P < 0.001). This study shows that, in Chile, market animals have more bruises than those sourced directly from farms, and their distribution is different. More information about the causes of infliction may help reduce bruises and it may also improve their welfare. Further studies are required to elucidate whether the causes of the high bruising in the case of animals passing through markets are related only to extra handling (repeated loading, unloading, transportation, eventual mixing) or to the way of handling by personnel and inadequate design.\nDocument [9]: Title: A 43-Year-Old Woman With Fatigue, Pancytopenia, and Mediastinal Adenopathy. Abstract: A 43-year-old woman without significant medical history was admitted with fatigue for 2 months. Before her current presentation, she had experienced several weeks of heavy menstrual bleeding and easy bruising. She denied night sweats, weight loss, chills, sore throat, neck swelling, rash, joint pain, cough, fever, or shortness of breath. The patient admitted a 20-year half-pack per day smoking habit that she had not been able to quit. She denied significant occupational or environmental exposures, a family history of malignancy, or current use of medications.\nDocument [10]: Title: Acquired hemophilia in the patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis: case report. Abstract: Acquired hemophilia is a severe bleeding diathesis caused by autoantibodies against a coagulation factor VIII (FVIII inhibitor). Massive bleeding diathesis, often life threatening are observed in almost 90% of patients. In 50-60% of cases, inhibitor emerges spontaneously. However, there are some conditions like pregnancy, puerperium, autoimmune disorders or cancers that seem to induce acquired hemophilia. We report a case of a 49-year-old woman suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for several years, who was diagnosed with acquired hemophilia in September 2011. The patient had been treated by steroids and leflunomide during the last few months. At the time of diagnosis, diffuse bruising of the forearms and the trunk was observed. The patient was treated with recombinant activated factor VII, and the first-line immunosuppressive therapy was introduced (cyclophosphamide and prednisone). We observed the elimination of symptoms and the disappearance of diathesis. Significant reduction of the titer of inhibitor was achieved, but only partial remission was obtained. It lasted until the beginning of December 2011, when the titer of the inhibitor increased again and massive bleeding to the left lower limb occurred. It was necessary to administer recombinant factor VIIa together with the second-line immunosuppressive therapy based on the Budapest protocol. The rapid reduction of the diathesis and improvement of the patient's general condition was achieved as previously. However, still there was no complete remission. After 2 weeks of treatment, the titer of inhibitor diminished, and factor VIII activity increased slightly. Because of RA, the patient was treated with methylprednisolone in maintenance doses during the next few weeks. Unfortunately, after over a month, the increase of inhibitor titer and the decrease of FVIII level were observed again. Some bruises appeared. It was necessary to increase doses of corticosteroids to therapeutic levels and add cyclophosphamide in low doses to prevent the appearance of more hemorrhagic diathesis. Partial remission was achieved a second time at the end of April 2012. The patient was given methylprednisolone with chloroquine as a maintenance treatment and the control of RA. The titer of the inhibitor increased again in June 2012, but there were no signs of diathesis. In August 2012, some bruises were detected, and we decided to add cyclophosphamide again instead of escalating the doses of methylprednisolone to prevent the occurrence of side-effects of corticosteroids. Cyclophosphamide was given with intervals only depending on activated partial thromboplastin time. No further diathesis was observed in spite of the lack of remission. We were forced to withdrawn cyclophosphamide completely in October 2012 because of signs of hematuria. Fortunately, right nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infection were the cause of that condition. These symptoms vanished after standard supportive treatment. Maintenance doses of corticosteroids and chloroquine were continued as the main treatment. The patient's condition was good, but the titer of inhibitor increased over the value that had been detected at the time of diagnosis, and some bruises appeared again at the end of January 2013. The decision to use rituximab as the next-line therapy was made. This anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is primarily\nDocument [11]: Title: Sentinel bruising as a presentation of metastatic melanoma. Abstract: A 46-year-old man presented with a 4-week history of bruising with subcutaneous nodules and weight loss. He also had a 2-week history of progressive back and hip pain. He had been diagnosed with stage Ib cutaneous melanoma 30 months previously, which had been fully excised. A sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative. On examination, there were five skin lesions at different stages. Each had spontaneously appeared as a bruise with a central subcutaneous nodule, and the bruising then faded to leave a persistent subcutaneous nodule. Excision of one of the nodules demonstrated a 4.5 mm diameter partly necrotic melanoma deposit in the dermis. CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis showed widespread metastases. This rare presentation of cutaneous malignant melanoma metastases has been termed 'sentinel bruising'. There are fewer than 10 cases reported in the literature.\nDocument [12]: Title: Child Abuse, Misdiagnosed by an Expertise Center-Part II-Misuse of Bayes' Theorem. Abstract: A newborn girl had, from two weeks on, small bruises on varying body locations, but not on her chest. Her Armenian grandmother easily bruised, too. Her mother was diagnosed with hypermobility-type Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrome (hEDS), an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder, with a 50% inheritance probability. Referral to a University Medical Center located \"<i>Dutch Expertise Center for Child Abuse</i>\" resulted (prior to consultation) in physical abuse suspicion. Protocol-based skeletal X-rays showed three healed, asymptomatic rib fractures. A protocol-based Bayesian likelihood ratio guesstimation gave 10-100, erroneously used to suggest a 10-100 times likelier non-accidental-than-accidental cause. Foster care placement followed, even in a secret home, where she also bruised, suggesting hEDS inheritance. Correct non-accidental/accidental Bayes' probability of symptoms is (likelihood ratio) &#215; (physical abuse incidence). From the literature, we derived an infant abuse incidence between about &#8776;0.0009 and &#8776;0.0026 and a likelihood ratio of &lt;5 for bruises. For rib fractures, we used a zero likelihood ratio, arguing their cause was birth trauma from the extra delivery pressure on the chest, combined with fragile bones as the daughter of an hEDS-mother. We thus derived a negligible abuse/accidental probability between &lt;5 &#215; 0.0009 &lt;0.005 and &lt;5 &#215; 0.0026 &lt;0.013. The small abuse incidence implies that correctly using Bayes' theorem will also miss true infant physical abuse cases. Curiously, because likelihood ratios assess how more often symptoms develop if abuse did occur versus non-abuse, Bayes' theorem then implies a 100% infant abuse incidence (unwittingly) used by LECK. In conclusion, probabilities should never replace differential diagnostic procedures, the accepted medical method of care. Well-known from literature, supported by the present case, is that (child abuse pediatrics) physicians, child protection workers, and judges were unlikely to understand Bayesian statistics. Its use without statistics consultation should therefore not have occurred. Thus, Bayesian statistics, and certainly (misused) likelihood ratios, should never be applied in cases of physical child abuse suspicion. Finally, parental innocence follows from clarifying what could have caused the girl's bruises (inherited hEDS), and rib fractures (birth trauma from fragile bones).\nDocument [13]: Title: Genetic analysis of three Korean patients with clinical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. Abstract: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a hereditary disorder of the connective tissue. EDS type IV (EDS IV), the vascular type of the disease, is characterized by easy bruising, thin skin with visible veins, and spontaneous rupture of the large arteries, uterus, or bowel. EDS IV is caused by mutations in the gene for type III procollagen (COL3A1). However, recent studies suggest that the causative mutation of EDS IV is not homogeneous. We report our experience with three patients presenting with clinical features of type IV EDS. A 48-yr-old woman presented with acute aortic dissection (patient 1) and 36-yr-old and 21-yr-old women presented with carotidcavernous fistula (patients 2 and 3, respectively). All three patients bruised easily. Two patients (patients 1 and 3) had thin transparent skin with visible veins. Genetic analysis of COL3A1 revealed a Gly732Val (c.2195G>T) mutation in patient 1 and a duplication of 15 base pairs (c.3221_3235dup) which resulted in an interposition of five amino acids (p.Gly1074_Pro1078dup) in patient 2. However, no mutations were observed in COL3A1 or transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 in patients 3, which might be either due to a deletion of single or multiple exons in the COL3A1 gene or due to a genetic heterogeneity. This is the first report of genetically confirmed cases of EDS IV in Korea.\nDocument [14]: Title: Pancytopenia after low dose methotrexate therapy in a hemodialysis patient: case report and review of literature. Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a side effect of pancytopenia. However, only a few cases of severe pancytopenia caused by low-dose MTX therapy have been reported, and the condition is rarely reported in uremic patients on dialysis therapy. We thereby report a hemodialysis patient who developed severe pancytopenia after oral treatment with low-dose MTX for RA. A 55-year-old woman who had been on regular hemodialysis treatment for 7 yr suffered from RA for 10 yr. She was regularly treated with celecoxib, prednisolone, and sulfasalazine in the past year. Because of the increasing arthralgia, 7.5 mg per week MTX was prescribed 3 months before admission. Stomatitis, fever, general fatigue, multiple skin carbuncles, and easy bruising developed after a cumulative dose of 90 mg. Pancytopenia was found at admission and the nadir of white blood cell count was 250/microL with 28% neutrophils, hematocrit was 22%, and platelet count was 6000/microL. Eosinophil counts increased from 11.5% initially to 26.1% on the sixth admission day. Transfusion with red blood cells and platelets, and appropriate antibiotics and folic acid were prescribed. She continued receiving regular hemodialysis and eventually recovered within 3 weeks.\nDocument [15]: Title: An autopsy case report of tramline bruises with various shapes -histological and mechanistic considerations. Abstract: An autopsy case involving a child showing various shapes of tramline bruises caused by a single weapon is described. On autopsy, multiple tramline bruises in different orientations were found, mainly on the back. Shapes of the tramline bruises were variable, including linear, arcuate, nodular, hook-like, and hook-like with a knot at the end. Due to the presence of severe subcutaneous hemorrhages and the absence of other potentially fatal injuries or diseases, we determined the cause of death to be traumatic shock. Microscopically, of the many tramline bruises, characteristic hemorrhages were observed on the right abdominal and left lumbar regions. Those hemorrhages were observed in the dermis, corresponding to macroscopic tramline bruises. Hemorrhage was also observed in the subcutis, corresponding to the pallor of the outer surface. The mechanisms by which tramline bruises occurred in the dermis and subcutis in this case are discussed with reference to the literature. We also propose subcutaneous and intradermal hemorrhagic types of tramline bruising.\nDocument [16]: Title: Impact sites representing potential bruising locations associated with rearward falls in children. Abstract: Children presenting multiple unexplained bruises can be an early sign of physical abuse. Bruising locations on the body can be an effective indicator of abusive versus accidental trauma. Additionally, childhood falls are often used as falsely reported events in child abuse, however, characterization of potential bruising locations associated with these falls does not exist. In our study we used a 12-month old pediatric anthropomorphic test device (ATD) adapted with a custom developed force sensing skin to predict potential bruising locations during rearward falls from standing. The surrogate bruising detection system measured and displayed recorded force data on a computerized body image mapping system when sensors were activated. Simulated rearward fall experiments were performed onto two different impact surfaces (padded carpet and linoleum tile over concrete) with two different initial positions (standing upright and posteriorly inclined) so that the ATD would fall rearward upon release. Findings indicated impact locations, and thus the potential for bruising in the posterior plane primarily within the occipital head and posterior torso regions.\nDocument [17]: Title: A large spontaneous abdominal bruise in a 60-year-old woman: a case report. Abstract: To report a case of severe abdominal bruising successfully diagnosed using systematic hemostatic investigations.\nDocument [18]: Title: Bleeding and bruising in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other collagen vascular disorders. Abstract: Easy bruising and bleeding are not only characteristic manifestations of clotting and platelet disorders, they are also prominent features in some heritable collagen disorders, such as the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS). The EDS comprise a heterogeneous group of connective tissue diseases sharing clinical manifestations in skin, ligaments and joints, blood vessels and internal organs. Most EDS subtypes are caused by mutations in genes encoding the fibrillar collagens type I, III and V, or in genes coding for enzymes involved in the post-translational modification of these collagens. Easy bruising is, to a variable degree, present in all subtypes of EDS, and is because of fragility of the capillaries and the perivascular connective tissues. Vascular fragility affecting medium-sized and large arteries and veins is typically observed in the vascular subtype of EDS, caused by a molecular defect in collagen type III, an important constituent of blood vessel walls and hollow organs. Extensive bruising, spontaneous arterial rupture, leading to severe internal bleeding or premature death, and rupture of hollow organs, such as the intestine or the gravid uterus are predominant features of this subtype. Haematological studies including evaluation of clotting factors, platelet aggregation and bleeding time are usually normal in patients with EDS, except for the Hess test (Rumple-Leede test), which may be abnormal, indicating capillary fragility. In some forms of EDS confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and subtype is possible with biochemical and molecular studies.\nDocument [19]: Title: Acute promyelocytic leukemia presenting with central nervous system involvement: a report of 2 cases. Abstract: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is rare, and the presence of CNS symptoms at the time of diagnosis of APL is even rarer. We report 2 cases of APL presenting with CNS involvement. A 43-yr-old woman presented with easy bruising and stuporous mentality. Her complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis with increased blasts. Bone marrow (BM) analysis was carried out, and the diagnosis of APL was confirmed. This was done by cytogenetic analysis and demonstration of PML-RAR\u03b1 rearrangement by reverse transcriptase PCR in the BM cells. A lumbar puncture was performed to investigate the cause of her stuporous mentality, and her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed 97% leukemic promyelocytes. Despite systemic and CNS therapy, she died due to septic shock by infection and rapid disease progression only 3 days after her admission. Another patient, a 3-yr-old girl, presented with easy bruising and epistaxis, and her CBC showed pancytopenia with increased blasts. BM studies confirmed APL. Quantitative PCR for PML-RAR\u03b1 in the BM cells revealed a PML-RAR\u03b1/ABL ratio of 0.33 and CSF analysis revealed 9.5% leukemic promyelocytes (2 of 21 cells). She received induction chemotherapy and intrathecal therapy and achieved complete remission (CR) in the BM and CNS. She has been maintained in the CR status for the past 31 months. Thus, patients with APL must be evaluated for CNS involvement if any neurological symptoms are present at the time of diagnosis.\nDocument [20]: Title: From unloading to trimming: studying bruising in individual slaughter cattle. Abstract: Livestock bruising is both an animal welfare concern and a detriment to the economic value of carcasses. Understanding the causes of bruising is challenging due to the numerous factors that have been shown to be related to bruise prevalence. While most cattle bruising studies collect and analyze data on truckload lots of cattle, this study followed a large number (<i>n</i> = 585) of individual animals from unloading through postmortem processing at five different slaughter plants. Both visual bruise presence and location was recorded postmortem prior to carcass trimming. By linking postmortem data to animal sex, breed, trailer compartment, and traumatic events at unloading, a rich analysis of a number of factors related to bruise prevalence was developed. Results showed varying levels of agreement with other published bruising studies, underscoring the complexity of assessing the factors that affect bruising. Bruising prevalence varied across different sex class types (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001); 36.5% of steers [95% confidence interval (CI): 31.7, 41.6; <i>n</i> = 378], 52.8% of cows (45.6, 60.0; 193), and 64.3% of bulls (no CI calculated due to sample size; 14) were bruised. There was a difference in bruise prevalence by trailer compartment (<i>P</i> = 0.035) in potbelly trailers, indicating that cattle transported in the top deck were less likely to be bruised (95% CI: 26.6, 40.4; <i>n</i> = 63) compared to cattle that were transported in the bottom deck (95% CI: 39.6, 54.2; <i>n</i> = 89). Results indicated that visual assessment of bruising underestimated carcass bruise trimming. While 42.6% of the carcasses were visibly bruised, 57.9% of carcasses were trimmed due to bruising, suggesting that visual assessment is not able to capture all of the carcass loss associated with bruising. Furthermore, bruises that appeared small visually were often indicators of larger, subsurface bruising, creating an \"iceberg effect\" of trim loss due to bruising.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: We report the case of an 18-year-old woman with personality disorders who was hospitalized a few hours after suicidal ingestion of acetaminophen, quetiapine, acetylsalicylic acid, and ethanol. Twelve hours after admission, severe liver damage was evident, but the patient was stable and awaiting hepatic transplantation. Electrolytes were successfully controlled. The condition of the liver stabilized. Cardiac biomarkers then deteriorated unexpectedly. Localized ST-segment elevations were noted on electrocardiogram, but angiography ruled out myocardial infarction. A computed tomographic scan ruled out cerebral edema. The patient died of irreversible cardiac arrest 40 hours after admission. Heart failure remained unexplained, and the body underwent forensic autopsy.At autopsy, histologic findings were indicative of acute toxic myocarditis and were concluded to be caused by acetaminophen intoxication. Acetaminophen overdose is common and typically leads to liver failure requiring supportive treatment and emergency liver transplantation. Toxic myocarditis is an extremely rare complication of acetaminophen overdose. It has only been reported 4 times in the literature despite the widespread use and misuse of acetaminophen. Toxic myocarditis remains a possibility in many cases of overdose but can be overlooked in a clinical picture dominated by hepatorenal failure and encephalopathy. Clinicians and forensic pathologists should be aware of this rare potential complication.\nDocument [2]: Title: Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of patients presenting to the emergency department with acetaminophen overdose. Abstract: This clinical policy focuses on critical issues concerning the management of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acetaminophen overdose. The subcommittee reviewed the medical literature relevant to the questions posed. The critical questions are: 1. What are the indications for N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in the acetaminophen overdose patient with a known time of acute ingestion who can be risk stratified by the Rumack-Matthew nomogram? 2. What are the indications for NAC in the acetaminophen overdose patient who cannot be risk stratified by the Rumack-Matthew nomogram? Recommendations are provided on the basis of the strength of evidence of the literature. Level A recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty; Level B recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect moderate clinical certainty; and Level C recommendations represent other patient management strategies that are based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence, or based on committee consensus. This guideline is intended for physicians working in EDs.\nDocument [3]: Title: Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of patients presenting to the emergency department with acetaminophen overdose.

Abstract: Acetaminophen is the most commonly used analgesic-antipyretic medication in the United States. Acetaminophen overdose, a frequent cause of drug toxicity, has been recognized as the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal hepatic necrosis. N-Acetylcysteine is the recommended antidote for acetaminophen poisoning. Despite evidence on the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine for prevention of hepatic injury, controversy persists about the optimal duration of the therapy. Here, we describe the case of a 65-year-old male with acetaminophen overdose and opioid co-ingestion who developed a second peak in acetaminophen serum levels after completing the recommended 21-hour intravenous N-acetylcysteine protocol and when the standard criteria for monitoring drug levels was achieved. Prolongation of N-acetylcysteine infusion beyond the standard protocol, despite a significant gap in treatment, was critical for successful avoidance of hepatotoxicity. Delay in acetaminophen absorption may be associated with a second peak in serum concentration following an initial declining trend, especially in cases of concomitant ingestion of opioids. In patients with acetaminophen toxicity who co-ingest other medications that may potentially delay gastric emptying or in those with risk factors for delayed absorption of acetaminophen, we recommend close monitoring of aminotransferase enzyme levels, as well as trending acetaminophen concentrations until undetectable before discontinuing the antidote therapy.\nDocument [5]: Title: TRPM2 channels mediate acetaminophen-induced liver damage. Abstract: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the most frequently used analgesic and antipyretic drug available over the counter. At the same time, acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure and the leading cause of chronic liver damage requiring liver transplantation in developed countries. Acetaminophen overdose causes a multitude of interrelated biochemical reactions in hepatocytes including the formation of reactive oxygen species, deregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis, covalent modification and oxidation of proteins, lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation. Although an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in hepatocytes is a known consequence of acetaminophen overdose, its importance in acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity is not well understood, primarily due to lack of knowledge about the source of the Ca(2+) rise. Here we report that the channel responsible for Ca(2+) entry in hepatocytes in acetaminophen overdose is the Transient Receptor Potential Melanostatine 2 (TRPM2) cation channel. We show by whole-cell patch clamping that treatment of hepatocytes with acetaminophen results in activation of a cation current similar to that activated by H2O2 or the intracellular application of ADP ribose. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPM2 in hepatocytes inhibits activation of the current by either acetaminophen or H2O2. In TRPM2 knockout mice, acetaminophen-induced liver damage, assessed by the blood concentration of liver enzymes and liver histology, is significantly diminished compared with wild-type mice. The presented data strongly suggest that TRPM2 channels are essential in the mechanism of acetaminophen-induced hepatocellular death.\nDocument [6]: Title: 17\u03b2-Estradiol protects against acetaminophen-overdose-induced acute oxidative hepatic damage and increases the survival rate in mice. Abstract: Acetaminophen overdose causes acute liver injury or even death in both humans and experimental animals. We investigated the effect of 17\u03b2-estradiol against acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury and mortality in mice. Male mice were given acetaminophen (p-acetamidophenol; 300 mg/kg; orally) to induce acute liver injury. Acetaminophen significantly increased the levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, myeloperoxidase, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione reductase, but it decreased superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione. In addition, acetaminophen-induced mortality began 4h post-treatment, and all mice died within 9h. 17\u03b2-Estradiol (200 \u03bcg/kg; i.p.) protected against acetaminophen-induced oxidative hepatic damage by inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and stimulating the antioxidant defense system. However, 17\u03b2-estradiol did not affect acetaminophen-induced glutathione depletion or increased glutathione reductase activity. We conclude that 17\u03b2-estradiol specifically attenuates acute hepatic damage and decreases mortality in acetaminophen-overdosed male mice.\nDocument [7]: Title: [Severe toxic acute liver failure: etiology and treatment]. Abstract: Many substances, drugs or not, can be responsible for acute hepatitis. Nevertheless, toxic etiology, except when that is obvious like in acetaminophen overdose, is a diagnosis of elimination. Major causes, in particular viral etiologies, must be ruled out. Acetaminophen, antibiotics, antiepileptics and antituberculous drugs are the first causes of drug-induced liver injury. Severity assessment of the acute hepatitis is critical. Acute liver failure (ALF) is defined by the factor V, respectively more than 50% for the mild ALF and less than 50% for the severe ALF. Neurological examination must be extensive to the search for encephalopathy signs. According to the French classification, fulminant hepatitis is defined by the presence of an encephalopathy in the two first weeks and subfulminant between the second and 12th week after the advent of the jaundice. During acetaminophen overdose, with or without hepatitis or ALF, intravenous N-acetylcysteine must be administered as soon as possible. In the non-acetaminophen related ALF, N-acetylcysteine improves transplantation-free survival. Referral and assessment in a liver transplantation unit should be discussed as soon as possible.\nDocument [8]: Title: Comparing N-acetylcysteine and 4-methylpyrazole as antidotes for acetaminophen overdose. Abstract: Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose can cause hepatotoxicity and even liver failure. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is still the only FDA-approved antidote against APAP overdose 40 years after its introduction. The standard oral or intravenous dosing regimen of NAC is highly effective for patients with moderate overdoses who present within 8 h of APAP ingestion. However, for late-presenting patients or after ingestion of very large overdoses, the efficacy of NAC is diminished. Thus, additional antidotes with an extended therapeutic window may be needed for these patients. Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole), a clinically approved antidote against methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, recently emerged as a promising candidate. In animal studies, fomepizole effectively prevented APAP-induced liver injury by inhibiting Cyp2E1 when treated early, and by inhibiting c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and oxidant stress when treated after the metabolism phase. In addition, fomepizole treatment, unlike NAC, prevented APAP-induced kidney damage and promoted hepatic regeneration in mice. These mechanisms of protection (inhibition of Cyp2E1 and JNK) and an extended efficacy compared to NAC could be verified in primary human hepatocytes. Furthermore, the formation of oxidative metabolites was eliminated in healthy volunteers using the established treatment protocol for fomepizole in toxic alcohol and ethylene glycol poisoning. These mechanistic findings, together with the excellent safety profile after methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning and after an APAP overdose, suggest that fomepizole may be a promising antidote against APAP overdose that could be useful as adjunct treatment to NAC. Clinical trials to support this hypothesis are warranted.\nDocument [9]: Title: [Good use and knowledge of paracetamol (acetaminophen) among self-medicated patients: Prospective study in community pharmacies]. Abstract: Acetaminophen (paracetamol), the highest over-the-counter (OTC) selling drug in France, is also the first cause of acute hepatic failure. We aimed to assess the good use and the knowledge of acetaminophen in a setting of urban self-medicated patients. We conducted a prospective observational study in randomly selected community pharmacies of Metz (France) agglomeration. Patients coming to buy OTC acetaminophen for themselves or their family had to answer to an anonymous autoquestionnaire. Responses were individually and concomitantly analyzed through 3 scores: good use, knowledge and overdosage. Twenty-four community pharmacies participated and 302 patients were interviewed by mean of a dedicated questionnaire. Most of patients (84.4%) could be considered as \"good users\" and independent factors of good use were (i) a good knowledge of acetaminophen (OR=5.3; P<0.0001) and more surprisingly; (ii) the fact of having no children (parentality: OR=0.1; P=0.006). Responses corresponding to involuntary overdosage were mostly due to a too short interval between drug intakes (3hours). Only 30.8% of patients were aware of liver toxicity of acetaminophen and only 40.7% knew the risk of the association with alcohol. Both good use and knowledge were significantly higher in patients looking for information from their pharmacist, physician and package leaflet. Patients should definitely be better informed about acetaminophen to warrant a better safety of its consumption. Pharmacists and physicians have to remind patients the risk factors of unintentional overdose and liver toxicity. Package leaflets have also to be more informative.\nDocument [10]: Title: Curcumin protects rats against acetaminophen-induced hepatorenal damages and shows synergistic activity with N-acetyl cysteine. Abstract: Acetaminophen is one of the most popular analgesic and antipyretic drugs and its overdose, which can cause severe damage to liver and kidneys, is one of the most common reasons of emergency admissions. In this study we investigated the effects of curcumin, derived from plant Curcuma longa, on acetaminophen toxicity, and the possibility of combining therapy of curcumin and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) to treat this toxicity. The experiments were conducted on 72 male Sprague-Dawley rats randomly divided into 12 groups. Control group was left without treatment, and the other groups were treated with different combinations of acetaminophen, curcumin and NAC. 15min after intraperitoneal injection, the blood level of curcumin was measured using HPLC. Blood levels of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were determined 18 and 42h after acetaminophen injection. One week later, the left kidney and the caudate lobe of the liver were harvested to assay glutathione peroxidase, catalase and malondialdehyde. The right kidney and the remaining lobes of the liver were used for histopathology. Analysis of organ function and oxidation parameters showed that curcumin significantly reduced toxic effects of acetaminophen on the liver and kidneys in a dose-dependent manner and significantly potentiated the protective effects of NAC. These findings were confirmed by histopathology. It is concluded that curcumin can protect the liver and kidney from the damage caused by acetaminophen overdose. Moreover, curcumin has the potential to be used in a combination therapy with NAC, significantly decreasing the therapeutic dose of NAC and therefore its side-effects.\nDocument [11]: Title: The MicroRNA-based Liquid Biopsy Improves Early Assessment of Lethal Acetaminophen Poisoning: A Case Report. Abstract: BACKGROUND Acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure. Nevertheless, new biomarker approaches enabling early prediction of the outcome of the acetaminophen overdose are needed. Recently, using next-generation sequencing analysis of serum from human study participants we uncovered injury-specific signatures of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) that represented underlying molecular mechanisms of toxicity. This case study is first to show the application of miRNA profiling to assess prognosis of acetaminophen poisoning. CASE REPORT The patient was admitted to the hospital following supra therapeutic acetaminophen ingestion. The patient showed elevated levels of biomarkers of hepatocellular injury alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Even though treatment with N-acetyl cysteine was initiated 24 hours post-ingestion, levels of alanine-aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase peaked at about 40 hours post ingestion of acetaminophen. We analyzed global circulating miRNA levels from 24 consecutive serum samples from this study participant covering the period from admission to time of death. CONCLUSIONS The resulting global miRNA profiles were compared with profiles from study participants with non-lethal acetaminophen poisoning and healthy controls. At the admission, the miRNA profiles of both lethal and non-lethal acetaminophen poisoning showed induction of cellular stress and oxidative damage. Later, the miRNA profiles of the lethal poisoning featured fibrosis and coagulation pathways while profiles of non-lethal cases resembled those of healthy study participants. Although additional confirmatory studies are needed, our case study is first to indicate that global miRNA profiles to be used as liquid biopsies have potential to facilitate the assessment of acetaminophen poisoning.\nDocument [12]: Title: Hypothermia and protection from acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Abstract: Acetaminophen-induced liver failure is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. The exact mechanism of acute liver failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity is unknown, although a presumed mechanism of hepatocellular necrosis involving the accumulation of a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine) has been postulated. A 62-year-old woman with a history of a suicide attempt was brought to the emergency department at \u223c12 hours post acetaminophen overdose. The patient presented with an acetaminophen level of 284 mcg/mL and with profound hypothermia (31\u00b0C). Liver function tests and coagulation studies were normal. Within 24 hours of presentation, the patient was normothermic, had received seven oral doses of N-acetylcysteine, and had an acetaminophen level of <5 mcg/mL. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit at 96 hours post admission in stable condition with no evidence of hepatic injury. No further treatment with N-acetylcysteine was required. Despite a toxic acetaminophen level, this patient did not suffer any hepatic injury. Hypothermia may have attenuated the production of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine by depressing the cytochrome P450 system, allowing accumulation of the parent drug rather than toxic metabolites. This case report suggests that hypothermia may have protected the liver of a patient presenting with acetaminophen toxicity and supports further investigation into the potential therapeutic role of induced hypothermia during acetaminophen toxicity.\nDocument [13]: Title: Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity: an updated review. Abstract: As the most common cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the USA and UK, acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity remains a significant public health concern and common indication for emergent liver transplantation. This problem is largely attributable to acetaminophen combination products frequently prescribed by physicians and other healthcare professionals, with unintentional and chronic overdose accounting for over 50 % of cases of acetaminophen-related ALF. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine can effectively reduce progression to ALF if given early after an acute overdose; however, liver transplantation is the only routinely used life-saving therapy once ALF has developed. With the rapid course of acetaminophen-related ALF and limited supply of donor livers, early and accurate diagnosis of patients that will require transplantation for survival is crucial. Efforts in developing novel treatments for acetaminophen-induced ALF are directed toward bridging patients to recovery. These include auxiliary, artificial, and bioartificial support systems. This review outlines the most recent developments in diagnosis and management of acetaminophen-induced ALF.\nDocument [14]: Title: Cytokines and toxicity in acetaminophen overdose. Abstract: Several cytokines have been reported to have hepatoprotective properties in animal models of acetaminophen toxicity. To investigate the relationships of cytokines and toxicity in acetaminophen overdose, blood samples were collected from patients following acute ingestions of acetaminophen. Samples for cytokine analysis were collected at the time of routine clinical monitoring in 111 patients (90 females; mean age 13.6 years). Plasma concentrations of interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were stratified by toxicity severity, defined by the maximal values of hepatic transaminase elevation. Levels of interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were higher in patients with serum alanine aminotransferase > 1000 IU/L, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 had the strongest association with toxicity. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 values were higher in patients with greater delays in N-acetylcysteine treatment and in patients with higher values of prothrombin time. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 elevation in acetaminophen overdose may represent an innate, immunomodulary response of the liver to earlier events in the toxicity. An understanding of the role of cytokine responses in acetaminophen overdose may be relevant to the future development of new therapies for acetaminophen toxicity.\nDocument [15]: Title: Understanding lactic acidosis in paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning. Abstract: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of the most commonly taken drugs in overdose in many areas of the world, and the most common cause of acute liver failure in both the UK and USA. Paracetamol poisoning can result in lactic acidosis in two different scenarios. First, early in the course of poisoning and before the onset of hepatotoxicity in patients with massive ingestion; a lactic acidosis is usually associated with coma. Experimental evidence from studies in whole animals, perfused liver slices and cell cultures has shown that the toxic metabolite of paracetamol, N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imine, inhibits electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and thus inhibits aerobic respiration. This occurs only at very high concentrations of paracetamol, and precedes cellular injury by several hours. The second scenario in which lactic acidosis can occur is later in the course of paracetamol poisoning as a consequence of established liver failure. In these patients lactate is elevated primarily because of reduced hepatic clearance, but in shocked patients there may also be a contribution of peripheral anaerobic respiration because of tissue hypoperfusion. In patients admitted to a liver unit with paracetamol hepatotoxicity, the post-resuscitation arterial lactate concentration has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality, and is included in the modified King's College criteria for consideration of liver transplantation. We would therefore recommend that post-resuscitation lactate is measured in all patients with a severe paracetamol overdose resulting in either reduced conscious level or hepatic failure.\nDocument [16]: Title: 5-oxoproline-induced anion gap metabolic acidosis after an acute acetaminophen overdose. Abstract: Metabolic acidosis after acute acetaminophen overdose is typically attributed to either transient lactic acidosis without evidence of hepatic injury or hepatic failure. High levels of the organic acid 5-oxoprolinuria are usually reported in patients with predisposing conditions, such as sepsis, who are treated in a subacute or chronic fashion with acetaminophen. The authors report a case of a 40-year-old woman who developed anion gap metabolic acidosis and somnolence after an acute acetaminophen overdose. Substantial hepatic damage did not occur, which ruled out acetaminophen-induced hepatic insufficiency as a cause of the patient's acidosis or altered mental status. Urinalysis revealed elevated levels of 5-oxoproline, suggesting that the patient's acute acetaminophen overdose was associated with marked anion gap metabolic acidosis due solely to 5-oxoproline without hepatic complications. The acidosis fully resolved with N-acetylcysteine treatment and supportive care including hydration.\nDocument [17]: Title: Cell-permeable succinate prodrugs rescue mitochondrial respiration in cellular models of acute acetaminophen overdose. Abstract: Acetaminophen is one of the most common over-the-counter pain medications used worldwide and is considered safe at therapeutic dose. However, intentional and unintentional overdose accounts for up to 70% of acute liver failure cases in the western world. Extensive research has demonstrated that the induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are central to the development of acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Despite the insight gained on the mechanism of acetaminophen toxicity, there still is only one clinically approved pharmacological treatment option, N-acetylcysteine. N-acetylcysteine increases the cell's antioxidant defense and protects liver cells from further acetaminophen-induced oxidative damage. Because it primarily protects healthy liver cells rather than rescuing the already injured cells alternative treatment strategies that target the latter cell population are warranted. In this study, we investigated mitochondria as therapeutic target for the development of novel treatment strategies for acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Characterization of the mitochondrial toxicity due to acute acetaminophen overdose in vitro in human cells using detailed respirometric analysis revealed that complex I-linked (NADH-dependent) but not complex II-linked (succinate-dependent) mitochondrial respiration is inhibited by acetaminophen. Treatment with a novel cell-permeable succinate prodrug rescues acetaminophen-induced impaired mitochondrial respiration. This suggests cell-permeable succinate prodrugs as a potential alternative treatment strategy to counteract acetaminophen-induced liver injury.\nDocument [18]: Title: Acetaminophen-induced acute pancreatitis: A case report and literature review. Abstract: Acute pancreatitis is rarely associated with drugs. Acetaminophen overdose is a well-known cause of hepatic toxicity, but drug-induced pancreatitis is rarely reported, especially after mild overdose. A 32-year-old woman presented with nausea and vomiting for 12 h, but no abdominal pain following an overdose of eight Tylenol tablets containing acetaminophen (325 mg acetaminophen per tablet). Laboratory results on admission showed abnormal amylase and lipase levels but completely normal liver function. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed mild swelling of the pancreas without fluid collection around the pancreas. The patient complained of severe abdominal pain five days after admission when attempting to drink water and liquids. Eight days after admission, fluid around the pancreas was observed by computed tomography. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with acetaminophen-induced acute pancreatitis after exclusion of common causes. Routine treatment for pancreatitis and N-acetylcysteine were administered to prevent disease progression. The patient was discharged in good condition.\nDocument [19]: Title: Acrolein, a highly toxic aldehyde generated under oxidative stress in vivo, aggravates the mouse liver damage after acetaminophen overdose. Abstract: Although acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice has been extensively studied as a model of human acute drug-induced hepatitis, the mechanism of liver injury remains unclear. Liver injury is believed to be initiated by metabolic conversion of acetaminophen to the highly reactive intermediate N-acetyl p-benzoquinoneimine, and is aggravated by subsequent oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH). In this study, we found that a highly toxic unsaturated aldehyde acrolein, a byproduct of oxidative stress, has a major role in acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Acetaminophen administration in mice resulted in liver damage and increased acrolein-protein adduct formation. However, both of them were decreased by treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA), two known acrolein scavengers. The specificity of NAC and MESNA was confirmed in cell culture, because acrolein toxicity, but not H2O2 or \u2022OH toxicity, was inhibited by NAC and MESNA. These results suggest that acrolein may be more strongly correlated with acetaminophen-induced liver injury than ROS, and that acrolein produced by acetaminophen-induced oxidative stress can spread from dying cells at the primary injury site, causing damage to the adjacent cells and aggravating liver injury.\nDocument [20]: Title: The NACSTOP Trial: A Multicenter, Cluster-Controlled Trial of Early Cessation of Acetylcysteine in Acetaminophen Overdose. Abstract: Historically, intravenous acetylcysteine has been delivered at a fixed dose and duration of 300 mg/kg over 20 to 21 hours to nearly every patient deemed to be at any risk for hepatotoxicity following acetaminophen overdose. We investigated a 12-hour treatment regimen for selected low-risk patients. This was a multicenter, open-label, cluster-controlled trial at six metropolitan emergency departments. We enrolled subjects following single or staggered acetaminophen overdose with normal serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and creatinine on presentation and at 12 hours, and less than 20 mg/L acetaminophen at 12 hours. Patients were allocated to intervention (250 mg/kg over 12-hour) or control (300 mg/kg over 20-hour) regimens by site. The primary outcome was incidence of \"hepatic injury\" 20 hours following initiation of acetylcysteine treatment, defined as ALT doubling and peak ALT greater than 100 IU/L, indicating the need for further antidotal treatment. Secondary outcomes included incidence of hepatotoxicity (ALT > 1,000 IU/L), peak international normalized ratio (INR), and adverse drug reactions. Of the 449 acetaminophen overdoses receiving acetylcysteine, 100 were recruited to the study. Time to acetylcysteine (median 7 hours [interquartile ratio 6,12] versus 7 hours [6,10]) and initial acetaminophen (124 mg/L [58,171] versus 146 mg/L [66,204]) were similar between intervention and control groups. There was no difference in ALT (18 IU/L [13,22] versus 16 IU/L [13,21]) or INR (1.2 versus 1.2) 20 hours after starting acetylcysteine between groups. No patients developed hepatic injury or hepatotoxicity in either group (odds ratio 1.0 [95% confidence interval 0.02, 50]). No patients represented with liver injury, none died, and 96 of 96 were well at 14-day telephone follow-up. Conclusion: Discontinuing acetylcysteine based on laboratory testing after 12 hours of treatment is feasible and likely safe in selected patients at very low risk of liver injury from acetaminophen overdose.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) is a rare disorder characterized by severe short stature, short hands and feet, limited joint mobility, skin thickening, characteristic facial features (e.g., a \"happy\" face), and cardiac valvular disorders that often result in an early death. The genes ADAMTSL2 (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif-like 2) and FBN1 (fibrillin 1) were recently identified as causative genes for GD. Here, we describe a 10-year-old Japanese female with GD who was born to non-consanguineous parents. At the age of 11 months, she was referred to our hospital because of very short stature for her age (-4.4 standard deviations of the age-matched value) and a \"happy\" face with full cheeks, a shortened nose, hypertelorism, and a long and flat philtrum, characteristic of GD. Her hands and feet were small, her skin was thickened, and her joint mobility was generally limited. She had cardiac valvular disorders and history of recurrent respiratory failure. Mutation analysis revealed no abnormalities in ADAMTSL2. However, analysis of FBN1 revealed a novel heterozygous mutation (c.5161T>T/G) in exon 41, which encodes transforming growth factor-\u03b2-binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5). GD is an extremely rare disorder and, to our knowledge, only one case of GD with an FBN1 mutation has been reported in Japan. Similar to the previously reported cases of GD, the mutation in the current patient was located in the TB5 domain, which suggests that abnormalities in this domain of FBN1 are responsible for GD.\nDocument [2]: Title: Experimental and bioinformatic characterisation of the promoter region of the Marfan syndrome gene, FBN1. Abstract: Mutations in the FBN1 gene, encoding the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-1, result in the dominant connective tissue disease Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome has a variable phenotype, even within families carrying the same FBN1 mutation. Differences in gene expression resulting from sequence differences in the promoter region of the FBN1 gene are likely to be involved in causing this phenotypic variability. In this report, we present an analysis of FBN1 transcription start site (TSS) use in mouse and human tissues. We found that transcription of FBN1 initiated primarily from a single CpG-rich promoter which was highly conserved in mammals. It contained potential binding sites for a number of factors implicated in mesenchyme differentiation and gene expression. The human osteosarcoma line MG63 had high levels of FBN1 mRNA and secreted fibrillin-1 protein to form extracellular matrix fibres. The human embryonic kidney line HEK293 and two breast cancer lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 had levels of FBN1 mRNA 1000 fold lower and produced negligible amounts of fibrillin-1 protein. Therefore MG63 appears to be the optimal cell line for examining tissue-specific, biologically relevant promoter activity for FBN1. In reporter assays, the conserved promoter region was more active in MG63 cells than in non-FBN1-expressing lines but additional elements outside the proximal promoter are probably required for optimal tissue-specific expression. Understanding the regulation of the FBN1 gene may lead to alternative therapeutic strategies for Marfan syndrome.\nDocument [3]: Title: Double heterozygous variants in FBN1 and FBN2 in a Thai woman with Marfan and Beals syndromes. Abstract: A phenotype of an individual is resulted from an interaction among variants in several genes. Advanced molecular technologies allow us to identify more patients with mutations in more than one genes. Here, we studied a Thai woman with combined clinical features of Marfan (MFS) and Beals (BS) syndromes including frontal bossing, enophthalmos, myopia, the crumpled appearance to the top of the pinnae, midface hypoplasia, high arched palate, dermal stretch marks, aortic enlargement, mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation, aortic root dilatation, and progressive scoliosis. The aortic root enlargement was progressive to a diameter of 7.2 cm requiring an aortic root replacement at the age of 8 years. At her last visit when she was 19 years old, she had moderate aortic regurgitation. Exome sequencing revealed that she carried the c.3159C > G (p.Cys1053Trp) in exon 26 of FBN1 and c.2638G > A (p. Gly880Ser) in exon 20 of FBN2. The variant in FBN1 was de novo, while that in FBN2 was inherited from her unaffected mother. Both genes encode for fibrillins, which are essential for elastic fibers and can form the heterotypic microfibrils. Two defective fibrillins may synergistically worsen cardiovascular manifestations seen in our patient. In this study, we identified the fourth patient with both MFS and BS, carrying mutations in both FBN1 and FBN2.\nDocument [4]: Title: Effect of mutation type and location on clinical outcome in 1,013 probands with Marfan syndrome or related phenotypes and FBN1 mutations: an international study. Abstract: Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of overlapping phenotypes. Clinical care is complicated by variable age at onset and the wide range of severity of aortic features. The factors that modulate phenotypical severity, both among and within families, remain to be determined. The availability of international FBN1 mutation Universal Mutation Database (UMD-FBN1) has allowed us to perform the largest collaborative study ever reported, to investigate the correlation between the FBN1 genotype and the nature and severity of the clinical phenotype. A range of qualitative and quantitative clinical parameters (skeletal, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, skin, pulmonary, and dural) was compared for different classes of mutation (types and locations) in 1,013 probands with a pathogenic FBN1 mutation. A higher probability of ectopia lentis was found for patients with a missense mutation substituting or producing a cysteine, when compared with other missense mutations. Patients with an FBN1 premature termination codon had a more severe skeletal and skin phenotype than did patients with an inframe mutation. Mutations in exons 24-32 were associated with a more severe and complete phenotype, including younger age at diagnosis of type I fibrillinopathy and higher probability of developing ectopia lentis, ascending aortic dilatation, aortic surgery, mitral valve abnormalities, scoliosis, and shorter survival; the majority of these results were replicated even when cases of neonatal MFS were excluded. These correlations, found between different mutation types and clinical manifestations, might be explained by different underlying genetic mechanisms (dominant negative versus haploinsufficiency) and by consideration of the two main physiological functions of fibrillin-1 (structural versus mediator of TGF beta signalling). Exon 24-32 mutations define a high-risk group for cardiac manifestations associated with severe prognosis at all ages.\nDocument [5]: Title: The FBN1 (R2726W) mutation is not fully penetrant. Abstract: The R2726W mutation in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1, Marfan syndrome) gene segregates with isolated skeletal features of Marfan syndrome and/or high stature. Here we report a family in which two out of four individuals, an 18-year-old son and his mother, a 41-year-old woman, had the R2726W mutation of FBN1. Both family members carrying the mutation were of average height. The son had a Marfan-like phenotype, but his mother did not. The FBN1 R2776W mutation, which is associated with skeletal features of Marfan syndrome, appears incompletely penetrant. Consequently, genetic counselling in the presence of this mutation is difficult.\nDocument [6]: Title: The roles of two novel FBN1 gene mutations in the genotype-phenotype correlations of Marfan syndrome and ectopia lentis patients with marfanoid habitus. Abstract: Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene have been identified in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Marfan-like connective tissue disorders. In this study, two Chinese families were recruited. The patients in family 1 were well characterized with MFS, while those in family 2 displayed Marfan-like disorders such as ectopia lentis (EL) and marfanoid habitus, but did not develop cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to analyze the pathogenic mutations and their relationships with phenotypes in these two Chinese families. All participants underwent complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations. The 65 exons and flanking intronic sequences of FBN1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and screened for mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing. One hundred and fifteen unrelated controls were analyzed using the same methods to confirm the mutations. In family 1, we identified the mutation p.C499S in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (cbEGF)-like domain 3 of FBN1. In family 2, the mutation p.C908Y was identified in an interdomain region of the hybrid motif 2 linked to the cbEGF-like domain 10. It can be concluded that FBN1 mutations involving cysteine substitutions are usually associated with MFS and EL with some MFS features. Moreover, pathology seemed more serious when the mutations disrupted the three disulfide bridges in the cbEGF-like domains, which was more likely to cause typical MFS than if the mutations occurred in the hybrid motifs. Our data preliminarily establish a genotype-phenotype correlation in the diagnostic process of MFS and predominant EL with Marfan-like features.\nDocument [7]: Title: A report of three families with FBN1-related acromelic dysplasias and review of literature for genotype-phenotype correlation in geleophysic dysplasia. Abstract: Acromelic dysplasia is a heterogeneous group of rare skeletal dysplasias characterized by distal limb shortening. Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) and Acromicric dysplasia (AD) are clinically distinct entities within this group of disorders and are characterized by short stature, short hands, stiff joints, skin thickening, facial anomalies, normal intelligence and skeletal abnormalities. Mutations of the Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene have been reported to cause AD, GD and related phenotypes. We reported three families with acromelic short stature. FBN1 analysis showed that all affected individuals carry a heterozygous missense mutation c.5284G > A (p.Gly1762Ser) in exon 42 of the FBN1 gene. This mutation was previously reported to be associated with GD. We reviewed the literature and compared the clinical features of the patients with FBN1 mutations to those with A Distintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin repeats-like 2 gene (ADAMTSL2) mutations. We found that tip-toeing gait, long flat philtrum and thin upper upper lip were more consistently found in GD patients with ADAMTSL2 mutations than in those with FBN1 mutations. The results have shed some light on the phenotype-genotype correlation in this group of skeletal disorders. A large scale study involving multidisciplinary collaboration would be needed to consolidate our findings.\nDocument [8]: Title: Co-existence of Marfan syndrome and systemic sclerosis: A case report and a hypothesis suggesting a common link. Abstract: FBN1 gene encodes for the connective tissue protein fibrillin-1 which can also regulate the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u00df1. Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), a genetic condition with defective connective tissues. FBN1 haplotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms have also been reported to be associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc), a connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis of multiple organs. Furthermore, the duplication of the Fbn1 gene causes a SSc-like disease in the TsK1 mouse model. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of MFS and SSc co-existing in a patient. Here, we describe a 46-year-old woman who presented with cardiac failure. She had a family history of MFS. Physical examination revealed marfanoid habitus and scleroderma features. Echocardiography demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy with aortic root dilatation, aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, mid-wall fibrosis at basal septal wall and dilated aortic root. Extractable nuclear antigen panel detected anti-Scl 70. She fulfilled Ghent criteria for MFS and satisfied American College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for SSc. Although we do not have the FBN1 sequence in our patient, the co-existence of MFS and SSc in this patient raises the possibility of co-existence of distinct mutations in the FBN1 gene that could affect TGF-\u03b2 signaling differently, resulting in divergent pathologic consequences - loss of structural integrity in MFS versus increased extracellular matrix deposition in SSc, and different clinical manifestations.\nDocument [9]: Title: A novel fibrillin 1 gene mutation leading to marfan syndrome with minimal cardiac features. Abstract: Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissue, characterized by early development of thoracic aortic aneurysms and/or dissections, accompanied by ocular and/or skeletal involvement, and is caused by mutations in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene. We report on a patient with ectopia lentis and a nonprogressive aortic root dilatation who presented with a novel mutation affecting a conserved cysteine residue present in a calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain of FBN1 (ENSP00000325527, p.Cys538Phe; Chr15:48,805,751 G>T), as revealed by complete sequencing of the FBN1 gene exons and flanking sequences. Identification of the mutation led to genetic screening of apparently asymptomatic family members, allowing the detection of characteristic ocular phenotypes in the absence of typical cardiac Marfan features. This finding stresses the importance of genetic screening of asymptomatic relatives for FBN1 gene mutation carriers.\nDocument [10]: Title: Comprehensive molecular screening of the FBN1 gene favors locus homogeneity of classical Marfan syndrome. Abstract: In order to estimate the contribution of mutations at the fibrillin-1 locus (FBN1) to classical Marfan syndrome (MFS) and to study possible phenotypic differences between patients with an FBN1 mutation vs. without, a comprehensive molecular study of the FBN1 gene in a cohort of 93 MFS patients fulfilling the clinical diagnosis of MFS according to the Ghent nosology was performed. The initial mutation screening by CSGE/SSCP allowed identification of an FBN1-mutation in 73 patients. Next, sequencing of all FBN1-exons was performed in 11 mutation-negative patients, while in nine others, DHPLC was used. This allowed identification of seven and five additional mutations, respectively. Southern blot analysis revealed an abnormal hybridization pattern in one more patient. A total of 23 out of the 85 mutations identified here are reported for the first time. Phenotypic comparison of MFS patients with cysteine-involving mutations vs. premature termination mutations revealed significant differences in ocular and skeletal involvement. The phenotype of the eight patients without proven FBN1 mutation did not differ from the others with respect to the presence of major cardiac, ocular, and skeletal manifestations or positive familial history. Most likely, a portion of FBN1-mutations remains undetected because of technical limitations. In conclusion, the involvement of the FBN1-gene could be demonstrated in at least 91% of all MFS patients (85/93), which strongly suggests that this gene is the predominant, if not the sole, locus for MFS.\nDocument [11]: Title: FBN1 mutation screening of patients with Marfan syndrome and related disorders: detection of 46 novel FBN1 mutations. Abstract: Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant transmission. Major clinical manifestations affect cardiovascular and skeletal apparatuses and ocular and central nervous systems. We analyzed FBN1 gene in 99 patients referred to our Center for Marfan Syndrome and Related Disorders (University of Florence, Florence, Italy): 85 were affected by MFS and 14 by other fibrillinopathies type I. We identified mutations in 80 patients. Among the 77 different mutational events, 46 had not been previously reported. They are represented by 49 missense (61%), 1 silent (1%), 13 nonsense (16%), 6 donor splice site mutations (8%), 8 small deletions (10%), and 3 small duplications (4%). The majority of missense mutations were within the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains. We found preferential associations between The Cys-missense mutations and ectopia lentis and premature termination codon mutations and skeletal manifestations. In contrast to what reported in literature, the cardiovascular system is severely affected also in patients carrying mutations in exons 1-10 and 59-65. In conclusion, we were able to detect FBN1 mutations in 88% of patients with MFS and in 36% of patients with other fibrillinopathies type I, confirming that FBN1 mutations are good predictors of classic MFS.\nDocument [12]: Title: Novel non-synonymous mutation in the transforming growth factor beta binding protein-like (TB) domain of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene in a Han Chinese family with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Abstract: In order to further understand the role of fibrillin-1 (FBN1, OMIM 134797) perturbations in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome (MFS, OMIM 154700) we studied a Han Chinese family in which MFS was segregating. In the Chinese family with 5 affected members, mutation screening for FBN1 was performed using direct sequencing. A novel non-synonymous mutation in the transforming growth factor beta binding protein-like (TB) domain of the FBN1 gene was found. The missense mutation c.3022T>C (C1008R) located in exon 24. This mutation was present in the proband and in two other affected family members, but in neither unaffected family members nor unrelated control subjects. The novel non-synonymous mutation, c.3022T>C (C1008R) in the TB domain of FBN1 gene, may be involved in the pathogenesis of MFS in a Han Chinese family.\nDocument [13]: Title: Three novel mutations of the fibrillin-1 gene and ten single nucleotide polymorphisms of the fibrillin-3 gene in Marfan syndrome patients. Abstract: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of the extracellular matrix. Allelic variations in the gene for fibrillin-1 ( FBN1) have been shown to cause MFS. To date, over 550 mutations have been identified in patients with MFS and related connective tissue diseases. However, about a half of MFS cases do not possess mutations in the FBN1 gene. These findings raise the possibility that variants located in other genes cause or modify MFS. To explore this possibility, firstly we analyzed FBN1 allelic variants in 12 Japanese patients with MFS, and secondly we analyzed fibrillin-3 gene ( FBN3) in patients without FBN1 mutations using conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) and direct sequencing analysis. We identified three novel FBN1 mutations and ten FBN3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this report, we could not detect a responsible mutation of the FBN3 gene for MFS. Although the number of the cases in this report is small, at least these results suggest that disease-causing mutations in exon regions of the FBN3 gene are very rare in MFS.\nDocument [14]: Title: The clinical spectrum of missense mutations of the first aspartic acid of cbEGF-like domains in fibrillin-1 including a recessive family. Abstract: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a dominant disorder with a recognizable phenotype. In most patients with the classical phenotype mutations are found in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) on chromosome 15q21. It is thought that most mutations act in a dominant negative way or through haploinsufficiency. In 9 index cases referred for MFS we detected heterozygous missense mutations in FBN1 predicted to substitute the first aspartic acid of different calcium-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like (cbEGF) fibrillin-1 domains. A similar mutation was found in homozygous state in 3 cases in a large consanguineous family. Heterozygous carriers of this mutation had no major skeletal, cardiovascular or ophthalmological features of MFS. In the literature 14 other heterozygous missense mutations are described leading to the substitution of the first aspartic acid of a cbEGF domain and resulting in a Marfan phenotype. Our data show that the phenotypic effect of aspartic acid substitutions in the first position of a cbEGF domain can range from asymptomatic to a severe neonatal phenotype. The recessive nature with reduced expression of FBN1 in one of the families suggests a threshold model combined with a mild functional defect of this specific mutation.\nDocument [15]: Title: An FBN1 deep intronic mutation in a familial case of Marfan syndrome: an explanation for genetically unsolved cases? Abstract: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is caused by mutations in the FBN1 (fibrillin-1) gene, but approximately 10% of MFS cases remain genetically unsolved. Here, we report a new FBN1 mutation in an MFS family that had remained negative after extensive molecular genomic DNA FBN1 testing, including denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, Sanger sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Linkage analysis in the family and cDNA sequencing of the proband revealed a deep intronic point mutation in intron 56 generating a new splice donor site. This mutation results in the integration of a 90-bp pseudo-exon between exons 56 and 57 containing a stop codon, causing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Although more than 90% of FBN1 mutations can be identified with regular molecular testing at the genomic level, deep intronic mutations will be missed and require cDNA sequencing or whole-genome sequencing.\nDocument [16]: Title: Undescribed mutations in FBN1 gene in two family cases of Marfan syndrome. Abstract: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a multisystem autosomal dominant heritable disorder and, although there are over 1700 mutations that have been identified in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene associated with it, there are many variants that remain unknown. Here we report two family cases of MFS with two new undescribed variations (C914S and H2426C) in FBN1 gene. Both variations produce alterations in the structural conformation of the protein resulting in pathogenic events in these patients. Finally, this case report includes both pathogenic mutations that have also been clinically and genetically confirmed to result in MFS. This clinical, genetic, and <i>in silico</i> analysis of potentially harmful variations in unrelated MFS patients provides additional evidence for the suggested causative role of the mutations c.2740T&#160;&gt;&#160;A (C914S), c.7276_7278delCAT (p.H2426C) in FBN1 gene in MFS. &lt;<b>Learning objective:</b> New previously undescribed mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene related to Marfan syndrome (MFS) have been confirmed by genetic, bioinformatics, and clinical studies. It is well known that MFS is caused by mutations in FBN1 gene; however many of them remain unknown. These data could be relevant in the screening of these patients offering a different follow-up by considering these and other genetic mutations. These types of mutations should be considered in differential diagnosis.&gt;.\nDocument [17]: Title: Novel FBN1 mutations are responsible for cardiovascular manifestations of Marfan syndrome. Abstract: The fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene mutations result in Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have a variety of phenotypic variations. This disease is involved in the skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular system. Here we analyzed genotype-phenotype correlation in two Chinese families with MFS. Two patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections were diagnosed as MFS according to the revised Ghent criteria. Peripheral blood samples were collected and genomic DNAs were isolated from available cases, namely, patient-1 and his daughter and son, and patient-2 and his parents. According to the next-generation sequencing results, the mutations in FBN1 were confirmed by direct sequencing. A heterozygous frameshift mutation in exon 12 of FBN1 was found in the proband-1 and his daughter. They showed cardiovascular phenotype thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, a life-threatening vascular disease, and atrial septal defect respectively. One de novo missense mutation in exon 50 of FBN1 was identified only in the patient-2, showing aortic root aneurysm and aortic root dilatation. Intriguingly, two novel mutations mainly caused the cardiovascular complications in affected family members. No meaningful mutations were found in these two patients by screening all exons of 428 genes related with cardiovascular disease. The high incidence of cardiovascular manifestations might be associated with the two novel mutations in exon 12 and 50 of FBN1.\nDocument [18]: Title: Detection of thirty novel FBN1 mutations in patients with Marfan syndrome or a related fibrillinopathy. Abstract: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a disorder of the extracellular matrix caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1). Recent studies have illustrated the variability in disease severity and clinical manifestations of MFS. Useful genotype-phenotype correlations have been slow to emerge. We screened 57 unrelated patients with MFS or a Marfan-like phenotype using a combination of SSCP and/or DHPLC. We detected 49 different FBN1 mutations, 30 (62%) of which were novel. The mutations comprised 38 substitutions (78%), 10 deletions (20%), and one duplication (2%). There were 28 missense (57%), nine frameshift (18%), eight splice site (16%), and four nonsense mutations (8 %). Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed that patients with an identified FBN1 mutation were more likely to have ectopia lentis and cardiovascular complications compared to those without an identifiable mutation (relative risks of 4.6 and 1.9, respectively). Ectopia lentis was also found to be more prevalent in patients whose mutations involved a cysteine substitution (relative risk 1.6) and less prevalent in those with premature termination mutations (relative risk 0.4). In our hands, we achieved 93% mutation detection for DHPLC analysis of patients who fulfilled the Ghent criteria. Further analysis of detailed clinical information and mutation data may help to anticipate the clinical consequences of specific FBN1 mutations.\nDocument [19]: Title: Mutation spectrum of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene in Taiwanese patients with Marfan syndrome. Abstract: The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the Taiwanese population. In this study, we screened 294 patients from 157 families for the presence of FBN1 mutations using polymerase chain reaction/ denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR/DHPLC). We identified 56 mutations in 62 of the 157 (40%) families including 49 single-base substitutions (36 missense mutations, seven nonsense mutations, and six splicing sites), one small insertion, four small deletions, one small indel (insertion and deletion), and one exonic deletion (Exon 36). When family history was taken into consideration, the mutation detection rate rose to 91% (29 of 32). We further investigated the phenotypic data and found that one third (47 of 157) of the families fit the Ghent criteria for MFS. Based on that data, the mutation rate was 98% (46/47). That finding implies that family history and the Ghent criteria play a more important role than clinical manifestations in establishing a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Among the 56 mutations found in this study, 40 (71%) have not been registered in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) or in the Universal Mutation Database (UMD). This is the first study of the mutation spectrum of MFS in a cohort of patients in Taiwan. The database is expected to considerably improve genetic counseling for and medical care of MFS families.\nDocument [20]: Title: Expression of FBN1 during adipogenesis: Relevance to the lipodystrophy phenotype in Marfan syndrome and related conditions. Abstract: Fibrillin-1 is a large glycoprotein encoded by the FBN1 gene in humans. It provides strength and elasticity to connective tissues and is involved in regulating the bioavailability of the growth factor TGF\u03b2. Mutations in FBN1 may be associated with depleted or abnormal adipose tissue, seen in some patients with Marfan syndrome and lipodystrophies. As this lack of adipose tissue does not result in high morbidity or mortality, it is generally under-appreciated, but is a cause of psychosocial problems particularly to young patients. We examined the role of fibrillin-1 in adipogenesis. In inbred mouse strains we found significant variation in the level of expression in the Fbn1 gene that correlated with variation in several measures of body fat, suggesting that mouse fibrillin-1 is associated with the level of fat tissue. Furthermore, we found that FBN1 mRNA was up-regulated in the adipose tissue of obese women compared to non-obese, and associated with an increase in adipocyte size. We used human mesenchymal stem cells differentiated in culture to adipocytes to show that fibrillin-1 declines after the initiation of differentiation. Gene expression results from a similar experiment (available through the FANTOM5 project) revealed that the decline in fibrillin-1 protein was paralleled by a decline in FBN1 mRNA. Examination of the FBN1 gene showed that the region commonly affected in FBN1-associated lipodystrophy is highly conserved both across the three human fibrillin genes and across genes encoding fibrillin-1 in vertebrates. These results suggest that fibrillin-1 is involved as the undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells transition to adipogenesis but then declines as the developing adipocytes take on their final phenotype. Since the C-terminal peptide of fibrillin-1 is a glucogenic hormone, individuals with low fibrillin-1 (for example with FBN1 mutations associated with lipodystrophy) may fail to differentiate adipocytes and/or to accumulate adipocyte lipids, although this still needs to be shown experimentally.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: We report a 12-year-old female citrin-deficient patient presenting with severe anorexia and body weight loss, mimicking the restricting type of anorexia nervosa (AN). She showed normal development until age 10 years when she started to play volleyball at school. She then became gradually anorexic, and her growth was stunted. At age 12, she was admitted to hospital because of severe anorexia and thinness. She was first thought to have AN, and drip infusion of glucose solution and high-calorie drinks were given, but her condition deteriorated further. She had a history of neonatal hepatitis and was therefore suspected to have citrin deficiency (CD). Genetic analysis of SLC25A13 revealed that she was compound heterozygous for 851del4 and IVS16ins3kb, and a diagnosis of CD was made. A low-carbohydrate diet with oral intake of arginine and ursodeoxycholic acid was started, and her condition gradually improved. The clinical features in our patient were similar to those of AN, and therefore AN may also be an important clinical sign in adolescent patients with CD.\nDocument [2]: Title: A Young Woman with Excessive Fat in Lower Extremities Develops Disordered Eating and Is Subsequently Diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa, Lipedema, and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Abstract: BACKGROUND Lipedema is a loose connective tissue disease that causes disproportionate subcutaneous fat accumulation on the extremities. As a result of the increased subcutaneous tissue accumulation, lipedema is often confused with obesity by both physicians and patients. Poor awareness and limited diagnosis of lipedema contribute to the confusion of lipedema with obesity and can lead to decreased body image acceptance. Patients with lipedema may have anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by a distortion of body image, incorrect self-identification of being overweight, restricted eating behavior, and a relentless pursuit of weight loss. CASE REPORT A young woman with disproportionate fat accumulation on the lower half of her body self-identified as having obesity. She developed restrictive eating behavior and became obsessed with weight loss, resulting in anorexia nervosa. Her disproportionate subcutaneous tissue persisted despite losing weight to reach a nadir BMI of 15 kg/m\u00b2. After a decade-long struggle, her eating disorder resolved, and she maintained a healthy weight and BMI of 21.5 kg/m\u00b2 but disproportionate fat remained in her lower body. She experienced increasing leg tenderness, pain, and easy bruising and was diagnosed with lipedema. CONCLUSIONS Lack of recognition of lipedema by medical professionals and the public as a weight loss-resistant disease can affect body image acceptance. Lipedema was mistaken for obesity by the young woman in this case and likely played a role in her development of an eating disorder. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, are not rare and may be more common in women with lipedema.\nDocument [3]: Title: Anorexia, Maudsley and an impressive recovery: one family's story. Abstract: Ann was first diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at the age of 14 years. For two years she maintained unshakeable delusions that her body was grossly obese and that she did not require food to live. Her rational thought processes were swamped by overwhelming emotions of fear, self-loathing, rage and despair. She developed obsessive and compulsive behaviours, her reactions to food were phobic, she withdrew from social contact, was flooded by suicidal thoughts and had periods of self-harming. For 16 months after diagnosis Ann was seen by a variety of medical professionals who prescribed a range of treatments, some of which were life saving but none of which, crucially, had any appreciable impact on the long-term course of her illness. She then began treatment following the family-based Maudsley Approach which encourages parents to develop and maintain a programme of weight gain for their child. Six months after starting Maudsley Ann achieved a healthy body weight and all of her psychiatric symptoms began to disappear spontaneously. Over the next five months Ann's physical and mental health continued to improve dramatically. She has made a full recovery and has shown no sign of relapse for over 12 months.\nDocument [4]: Title: Chronic anorexia nervosa: enteral nutrition via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and liaison psychiatry. Abstract: Anorexia nervosa is a complex mental disorder characterized by altered eating behaviour often resulting in life-threatening weight loss (<85% of expected body weight) associated with amenorrhea and a disturbance of body image. Although classified as mental health disorders, they may lead to serious medical consequences and have the highest rate of premature death of any mental health diagnosis. We report our experience with the use of enteral feeding via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in a 39-year-old woman with chronic restricter anorexia nervosa treated in liaison psychiatry and psychotherapy. On admission to psychiatry unit, the patient presented seriously deteriorated general condition and a body mass index (BMI) of 10 (BMI = weight kg/height m(2)). She refused oral feeding, but eventually accepted nasogastric feeding. In preparation for her continuing long-term (>1 month) enteral feeding at home, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was performed and a home nutrition support regimen that met her energy-protein intake requirements was prescribed. During the follow-up period, an overall improvement in nutritional status, general condition, mood and cognitive functioning was observed. Patient compliance with refeeding is notoriously problematic; however, enteral feeding interventions may be feasible in the long-term treatment of selected anorexia nervosa patients when closely followed-up by a multidisciplinary medical team.\nDocument [5]: Title: [A case of anorexia nervosa with severe physical complications resulting in long-term hospitalization]. Abstract: We report the case of a woman in her late twenties with anorexia nervosa who was difficult to treat both psychologically and physically because she resisted being treated despite presenting with various and severe physical complications, such as a refractory tracheoesophageal fistula. On admission, she weighed 24.8 kg and her body mass index was 9.6 kg/m2. Treatment on a medical ward was not possible due to her resistance to being fed and repeated secretive and deviant behaviors. Therefore, she was treated mainly on a psychiatric ward, with a psychiatrist as the attending doctor. After hospitalization for more than 3 years, she had sufficiently recovered to leave the hospital. She was discharged weighing 37.7 kg and her body mass index was 14.5 kg/m2. As physical complications, the patient manifested with a tracheoesophageal fistula, duodenal bulb perforation, and tension pneumothorax, which were considered to reflect the vulnerability of the intrapleural and intraperitoneal soft tissue. She also manifested with lower limb edema, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, overreaction to a diuretic, dehydration, and hypernatremia, which were considered to reflect the disturbances of water balance. As seen in this case, a patient with anorexia nervosa who resists being fed, even though treatment of the physical complications requires an improved nutritional status above all, may require treatment on a psychiatric ward even at the risk of providing less than ideal care for the physical complications. We discuss \"medical psychiatry\" as a model for treating anorexia nervosa patients with severe physical complications. In this concept of \"medical psychiatry\", it is the most important that staff on the psychiatric ward take an interest in and have concerns about the patient's physical complications. If the psychiatrist as the attending doctor actively and continuously participates in the treatment of physical complications, it should be possible to create a treatment plan that, although complex due to its multidisciplinary nature, is followed smoothly and consistently, and, therefore, provide patients with trustworthy and appropriate medical treatment.\nDocument [6]: Title: A Case of Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalomyopathy with Metabolic Complications During Refeeding. Abstract: BACKGROUND Anorexia nervosa has been referred to as the \"great pretender\" of medicine and is often misdiagnosed. We present a rare genetic disorder that was misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa. This case highlights the diagnosis of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy in a patient with previously diagnosed anorexia nervosa, which was discovered due to the metabolic abnormalities and intolerance of nutrition encountered during refeeding. CASE REPORT A 24-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and psychogenic anorexia and recent diagnosis of avoidant restrictive food intake disorder presented to a medical stabilization unit for weight restoration and treatment of medical complications associated with extreme malnutrition. She reported being underweight her entire life, and had a body mass index of 12 kg/m2 for a year prior to admission. She reported a long-standing intolerance to enteral feeding and had not gained weight when prescribed parenteral nutrition. She reported a desire to gain weight and denied any body dysmorphia. Upon nutritional rehabilitation, the patient was found to have extreme insulin resistance, with serum glucose values exceeding 400 mg/dL, and multiple neurologic findings that were incongruent with the medical complications of anorexia nervosa. These metabolic abnormalities, with her physical examination findings, allowed for a diagnosis of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS This case report highlights the clinical presentation of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy, including the newly described extreme insulin resistance, and showcases the importance of avoiding confirmation bias and working through differential diagnoses that are inconsistent with a clinical presentation to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\nDocument [7]: Title: Combined treatment of olanzapine and mirtazapine in anorexia nervosa associated with major depression. Abstract: Several studies have shown that olanzapine is effective in weight restoration and maintenance for patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). However, major depression is a very common comorbid psychiatric disorder associated with AN. Additional antidepressant therapy may be required for treating anorexic patients with major depression. The authors present a case of AN associated with major depression, who responded well to the combination treatment of olanzapine and mirtazapine. A 27-year-old Taiwanese woman was admitted because of severe weight loss, poor nutrition, amenorrhea, major depression, and starvation complications including hematological dyscrasis, electrolytes and endocrine imbalance, and sinus bradycardia. In additional to nutritional and medical treatments, the patient was given olanzapine 10 mg/day and mirtazapine 30 mg/day. She took the combined medications for six months. Meanwhile she received cognitive behavior therapy and family therapy. With these treatments, the patient's depression was in remission, her body weight was increased from 24 to 38 kg, and her body mass index was increased from 9.8 to 15.5. Our case suggests that the combined treatment of olanzapine and mirtazapine can be used in the treatment of AN associated with major depression.\nDocument [8]: Title: Teriparatide treatment of osteoporosis in a patient with anorexia nervosa. Abstract: Osteoporosis commonly occurs in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and is often irreversible even after weight restoration. We describe a 52-year-old woman with AN and severe osteoporosis, discovered after she sustained multiple fractures from a fall. She had low weight for most of her life, but was only formally diagnosed with AN 6 years prior to her presentation. She received therapy for her eating disorder and was able to restore weight, which led to a 4.1 % improvement in her bone density. We then treated her with teriparatide for 2 years, which lead to a further 21 % increase in bone density and she has had no recurrence of fractures. Since AN-associated osteoporosis is characterized by low bone formation, teriparatide may be a useful treatment option.\nDocument [9]: Title: [Severe acute liver and pancreas damage in anorexia nervosa]. Abstract: Anorexia nervosa, a syndrome most commonly affecting young women, is characterized by weight less than 85% of weight that is considered normal for that persons age and height, distorted body image, and fear of becoming obese, and its mortality is up to 9%. We present a case of a 33-year-old woman with a 9-year history of anorexia nervosa. She admitted to our institution with decreased mentality, and her body mass index was 11.5 kg/m2 of the time admission. Initial aminotransferase level was severely elevated, but it was normalized solely with improved nutrition and weight gain. Five and sixteen days after the admission urinary tract infection and elevation of pancreatic enzymes occurred. They were successfully treated with antibiotics and nutritional support. Fifty seven days after the admission, she discharged. We report a case of acute hepatitis and pancreatitis treated with nutritional rehabilitation in a patient with severe anorexia nervosa for the first time in Korea.\nDocument [10]: Title: A Woman With Dyspnea, Weight Loss, and Splenic Lesions. Abstract: The patient is a 37-year-old hospital employee and current smoker with a 10 pack-year smoking history, who presented with dyspnea, chest pain, and weight loss. She was in her usual state of health until 4 months prior to admission when she developed intermittent left-sided chest pain, cough productive of scant yellow sputum, fevers, and anorexia. Initial chest radiograph was normal and her outpatient physician prescribed azithromycin, which she took without improvement. One month prior to admission, a follow-up chest radiograph revealed a left-sided upper lobe consolidation; she received a course of levofloxacin without improvement. At follow-up, given her occupation, 13.6-kg unintentional weight loss, and persistent pulmonary symptoms and infiltrate despite treatment for pneumonia, her provider referred her for admission with particular concern for exclusion of active TB. As a hospital employee with clinical exposure, she underwent annual TB screening, which was always negative. She had no known exposure to patients with TB. Her most recent travel was to the Midwestern United States, without significant outdoors exposure. Review of systems was positive for wheezing, anorexia, and arthralgias of both knees and the left ankle and wrist. There was no hemoptysis, leg swelling, visual changes, palpitations, or muscle weakness.\nDocument [11]: Title: A Case of Eating Disorder Diagnosed As Orthorexia Nervosa. Abstract: A 13-year-old girl presented to our hospital with chief complaints of rapid weight loss, fatigue, discomfort, chills in the extremities, and alopecia. We initially suspected anorexia nervosa (AN). However, she did not express fear of gaining weight or have a distorted perception of her weight or body shape; thus, her presentation was not typical of AN. We also suspected avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), but she did not exhibit any food-avoidance behaviors. However, she was obsessed with nutrition control, so we diagnosed her with orthorexia nervosa (ON). She was hospitalized, given education on proper nutrition, and her eating behavior subsequently improved. After discharge, we administered the ORTO-15, which assesses the propensity for ON, and her score met the diagnostic criteria for ON. The incidence of ON has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, her obsession was brought about by information she read in magazines and on social media that promoted an unbalanced diet centered almost exclusively on vegetables. Pediatricians should raise awareness of misinformation regarding children's health to ensure healthy growth.\nDocument [12]: Title: Brain tumors and the area postrema. Abstract: Brain tumors can rarely present with symptoms mistaken for anorexia nervosa. We report a patient with a long-standing history of anorexia who developed headaches and was found on brain MRI to have a brain tumor in the area of the fourth ventricle. On admission, the patient presented with a 4 month history of headaches and a 10 year history of \"anorexia nervosa\". Interestingly, the patient did not endorse the classic sense of an altered self-body image. Her body weight on admission was 37 kg. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor. On postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient subjectively reported an increased appetite. On POD 2, we documented that she finished her entire food tray for the first time during her hospital stay. Her peri-operative course was without any complications. She presented for a follow-up clinic visit 2 weeks postoperatively and was noted to have a new body weight of 47 kg (10 kg gain). To our knowledge, this is the first reported occurrence of a sporadic, and third overall occurrence, of a hemangioblastoma that presented with an anorexia nervosa-like syndrome that was ultimately cured with surgical resection. In patients presenting with a history of psychiatric illness, it is important to consider the possibility of underlying, organic pathologies in the central nervous system affecting the relevant neuro-anatomical domains.\nDocument [13]: Title: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Treatment of Depression and Anxiety in a Patient with Anorexia Nervosa. Abstract: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by restricted eating, emaciation, and distorted body image and tends to be a chronic and deadly disorder with a high risk of developing a relapsing course described as a severe and enduring anorexia. This case study reports a patient with AN with comorbid depression and anxiety who was treated by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Our patient's first hospitalization in our ED clinic was at the age of 25 in 2012. Her anorexia symptoms have been developing over 1.5 years. The body mass index (BMI) at admission was 12.21 kg/m\u00b2. She was stimulated by use of a MAGSTIM Super Rapid 2 device, every Monday through Friday (5 days a week) with the frequency 10 Hz, 15 trains/day, 100 pulses/train, intertrain interval 107 s for 10 days. The specific spot of stimulation was over the left DLPFC. The therapy was evaluated, both by the team and by the patient, as ineffective. Shortly after the therapy was finished, the patient was discharged with final weight of 46 kg and BMI 13.15 kg/m\u00b2. We showed, that despite our positive clinical experiences with rTMS therapy in depression and anxiety, the treatment of AN and comorbid depressive disorder with anxious distress, our patient's anorexic, anxious, and depressive symptoms remained unaffected. In this case, only invasive medical intervention helped the patient to reach normal weight, but without any significant changes in her psychology. This case study shows the need for further investigation of the influence that body weight might have and whether the number of sessions has an effect on rTMS efficacy.\nDocument [14]: Title: An Autopsy Case of an Elderly Patient with Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma Presenting with a Plethora of Clinical Symptoms and Signs. Abstract: BACKGROUND Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a potentially curable disease with favorable outcomes. However, elderly patients with HL usually have more adverse prognostic factors and hence a much worse prognosis than younger patients. CASE REPORT The patient was a woman in her 80s. She reported high fever, anorexia, and a weight loss of 8 kg within 5 months. She had been on treatment for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention and pacemaker implantation to treat acute coronary syndrome and sinus arrhythmia, respectively. Blood tests showed elevation of alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, leukocyte count, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen. Computed tomography did not show tumors in the liver, and cholangitis and sepsis were suspected. Aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin gradually increased through the course of the patient's hospital stay. Despite treatment, her condition deteriorated and she died 22 days after hospital admission. At autopsy, we found stage IV HL with lymph node swelling on both sides of the diaphragm, as well as diffusely disseminated nodules in the liver and spleen. CONCLUSIONS Our patient had several poor prognostic factors including B symptoms, comorbidity, advanced stage, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and expression of programmed death-ligand 1 and interleukin-6, all of which were closely connected with her advanced age. Her age and comorbidities may have been the most adverse prognostic factors for her illness. An effective HL screening method for elderly individuals should be developed to ameliorate poor prognosis and adverse outcomes.\nDocument [15]: Title: A Spring in the Desert: Infertility and Merciful Accompaniment. Abstract: The mystery of love as it unfolds in marriage is an adventure filled with wonder and anticipation for what the future holds. Such is the excitement and optimism of the couple embarking on family life by actively trying to conceive a child. For the couple struggling with infertility, however, joyful anticipation can soon devolve into anguish as they realize that their hoped-for children might not come. Though the pain of infertility is a shared experience in marriage, it is to the woman that evaluation, testing, and treatment is often directed. She may experience infertility as an assault on her feminine identity, her marriage, and her faith, leaving her vulnerable to reliance on scientific and technological solutions as the only relief for her pain. This turn toward science, if not integrated into the larger framework of overall health and well-being, has the danger of making the natural, good desire for a child into a quest to achieve a single-minded goal. When the child becomes a \"goal,\" husband, wife, and potential offspring become (unintentionally) objectified, and the woman's identity and the future of her marriage rest precariously on the shoulders of an ideal. It is within the context of the authors' lived experience of infertility, as well as hundreds of encounters with women in the Springs in the Desert community, that the authors contend that it is necessary to integrate the pain of infertility into a framework of <i>merciful accompaniment</i>. Pastors, physicians, and Fertility Care Providers are all uniquely well-placed to offer support and encouragement that affirm the intrinsic dignity of the wife and her husband, and the truth of their marriage as a witness to Christ in the world. When they meet the woman amidst her pain and longing, they can help her to understand infertility as a <i>circumstance</i> and not her <i>identity.</i> When the pain of infertility is seen and acknowledged, the medical and pastoral care she receives can positively impact her overall health and wellbeing, help her to turn to her husband, and ultimately encourage her to find God in the midst of the struggle.\nDocument [16]: Title: A case of severe anorexia, excessive weight loss and high peptide YY levels after sleeve gastrectomy. Abstract: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the second most commonly performed bariatric procedure worldwide. Altered circulating gut hormones have been suggested to contribute post-operatively to appetite suppression, decreased caloric intake and weight reduction. In the present study, we report a 22-year-old woman who underwent laparoscopic SG for obesity (BMI 46 kg/m(2)). Post-operatively, she reported marked appetite reduction, which resulted in excessive weight loss (1-year post-SG: BMI 22 kg/m(2), weight loss 52%, >99th centile of 1-year percentage of weight loss from 453 SG patients). Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging, GI physiology/motility studies and endoscopy revealed no anatomical cause for her symptoms, and psychological assessments excluded an eating disorder. Despite nutritional supplements and anti-emetics, her weight loss continued (BMI 19 kg/m(2)), and she required nasogastric feeding. A random gut hormone assessment revealed high plasma peptide YY (PYY) levels. She underwent a 3 h meal study following an overnight fast to assess her subjective appetite and circulating gut hormone levels. Her fasted nausea scores were high, with low hunger, and these worsened with nutrient ingestion. Compared to ten other post-SG female patients, her fasted circulating PYY and nutrient-stimulated PYY and active glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) levels were markedly elevated. Octreotide treatment was associated with suppressed circulating PYY and GLP1 levels, increased appetite, increased caloric intake and weight gain (BMI 22 kg/m(2) after 6 months). The present case highlights the value of measuring gut hormones in patients following bariatric surgery who present with anorexia and excessive weight loss and suggests that octreotide treatment can produce symptomatic relief and weight regain in this setting.\nDocument [17]: Title: Dofetilide-induced anorexia in an older adult. Abstract: An 84-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with an unexplained 4-month history of weight and appetite loss after initiation of dofetilide 125 mcg orally twice daily for atrial fibrillation. She was noted to have lost 2.5 kg, which was a 3.6% decrease from her initial body weight of 69.4 kg. After excluding other etiologies for her anorexia, such as medication changes or changes in other diseases or conditions, her primary care physician and cardiologists elected to continue dofetilide but monitor the patient's appetite and body weight. After 7 months of dofetilide use with persistent appetite loss, the cardiology team discontinued dofetilide. Continued weight loss was observed until approximately 1 month after stopping dofetilide, with a maximum weight loss of 2.9 kg or a 4.2% decrease. Improvements in appetite were reported 2 months after discontinuing dofetilide, with minor increases in weight that eventually stabilized. In this case, while taking dofetilide, the patient experienced anorexia leading to weight loss that subsided after discontinuation of the drug. Based on the temporal association between the patient's changes in appetite and body weight and treatment with dofetilide, the drug was most likely the cause of the patient's anorexia. We are unaware of other reports of anorexia associated with dofetilide, but clinicians may want to consider the drug as a potential cause for otherwise unexplained changes in appetite or body weight.\nDocument [18]: Title: A case of anorexia nervosa with comorbid Crohn's disease: beneficial effects of anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy? Abstract: This case report describes a 26-year-old woman affected by long-lasting anorexia nervosa (AN) and Crohn's disease. Worsening of the bowel illness led to the prescription of immunosuppressive therapy (biologic infliximab for 4 months, followed by adalimumab for 6 months) and referral to our Eating Disorders Unit. Although she initially demonstrated denial of her eating disorder, in a few months she gradually improved her weight and psychopathology. Crohn's disease can worsen AN by modifying hunger and energy expenditure through the effects of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, pro-inflammatory cytokines which moderate leptin and melanocortin signaling. Previous studies have observed the antidepressant effects of TNF antagonist in patients with treatment-resistant depression with high baseline inflammatory biomarkers. Our case report suggests that future studies are needed to clarify the existence, patterns, and extent of increased inflammatory markers in patients with AN, and whether they determine clinical features or identify subgroups of patients. Potential therapeutic significance of above issues remains to be determined.\nDocument [19]: Title: [Anorexia nervosa with refeeding syndrome: prevention and treatment of RS]. Abstract: Refeeding syndrome (RS), seen in the early stages of anorexia nervosa (AN) treatment, has not been paid sufficient attention regarding its strong association with poor outcomes. This report describes a case of AN restriction type (AN-R) with sequent RS appearance despite the introduction of progressive and careful low-calorie nutrition, and discusses RS treatment. The patient was a 16-year-old female. She was first diagnosed with AN at the age of 14 when she went on a diet, admitted into pediatrics, and recovered: however, AN recurred after she started high school, and her weight decreased to 31.8 kg. She was admitted to pediatrics again, refused to receive treatment, discharged from the hospital, and introduced to our department. Soon after she came to us, her weight went down to 29.6 kg, and continued to decrease to 26.8 kg. She was recommended to receive inpatient care, but she firmly refused. A few days later, her experience of loss of consciousness made her agree to receive inpatient care. At this time, she was already weakened and had difficulty performing voluntary body movements as well as excretion. She was treated carefully and placed on 125 kcal/day. On the 6th day of treatment, severe liver damage was observed, her serum phosphorus level went down to 2.0 mg/dL, and she was diagnosed with RS. The lowest concentration of serum phosphorus observed was 1.3 mg/dL with blood abnormality and delirium; however, our strict management with intravascular phosphorus administration supported her increased dietary intake, and the patient was able to leave the hospital on the 54th day after admission. Based on this experience, the pathogenesis of RS was overviewed, and RS prevention as well as treatment was discussed. It has been reported that low phosphorus levels are observed in approximately one quarter of AN patients, and, thus, immediate action and treatment of hypophosphatemia are necessary when considering RS occurrence. In this study, the observed serum phosphorus concentration was higher than the general reported values; however, it is critical to pay attention to any quick drop in the serum phosphorus level rather than the absolute value. Also, as a preventative method, it is important to start the treatment before the patient's situation becomes critical. Since eating disorders are classified as psychiatric disorders, treatments under involuntary hospital admission should be allowed to avoid the worst situation. The following are suggestions to justify protective hospital admissions for such cases and their minimal requirements. Such actions should be taken for patients who are significantly underweight or in a critical health condition due to sudden weight loss. It is easier for patients to adapt to the treatment when the condition is new-onset or short disorder duration cases before they become chronic problems. After the caregiver-patient medical care relationship has been forget and significant effort has been made to get the patient to agree to treatment, compulsory treatment should be implemented in cases in which patients do not agree to treatment to avoid life-threatening situations.\nDocument [20]: Title: Unusual cause of profound weight loss in a young woman. Abstract: A 27-year-old woman presented with anorexia, weight loss and psychiatric symptoms for the past 4&#8197;years. She did not have history of headache, visual disturbances or symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. She was sarcopenic with body mass index of 10.16&#8197;kg/m<sup>2</sup>Her systemic examination was normal except for temporal hemianopia suggesting a sellar/suprasellar lesion. Hormonal evaluation revealed pan-hypopituitarism with central diabetes insipidus. Subsequent neuroimaging revealed sellar-suprasellar mass lesion with intense contrast enhancement and leptomeningeal metastases. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed elevated &#946; human chorionic gonadotropin and the presence of syncytiotrophoblast germ cells. Histopathology from the mass lesion confirmed the diagnosis of germinoma. Immunohistochemistry of the tumour tissue was positive for c-kit and placental alkaline phosphatise. She received a combination of chemotherapy with craniospinal irradiation. Significant weight loss in a young woman may not always be an eating disorder like anorexia nervosa albeit more common than germ cell tumour.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Transient, symmetric, and deep inverted electrocardiogram (ECG) T waves in the setting of stroke, commonly referred to as cerebral T waves, are rare, and the underlying mechanism is unclear. Our study aimed to test the hypothesis that cerebral T waves are associated with transient cardiac dysfunction. This retrospective study included 800 patients admitted with the primary diagnosis of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. ECGs were examined for cerebral T waves, defined as T-wave inversion of \u22655 mm depth in \u22654 contiguous precordial leads. Echocardiograms of those meeting these criteria were examined for the presence of left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormalities. Follow-up evaluation included both ECG and echocardiogram. Of the 800 patients, 17 had cerebral T waves on ECG (2.1%). All 17 patients had ischemic strokes, of which 11 were in the middle cerebral artery distribution (65%), and 2 were cerebellar (12%), whereas the remaining 4 involved other locations. Follow-up ECG showed resolution of the T-wave changes in all 17 patients. Of these patients, 14 (82%) had normal wall motion, and 3 had transient wall motion abnormalities (18%). Two of these patients had Takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy with apical ballooning, and the third had globally reduced LV function. Coronary angiography showed no significant disease to explain the LV dysfunction. In summary, in our cohort of patients with acute stroke, cerebral T waves were rare and occurred only in ischemic stroke. Eighteen percent of patients with cerebral T waves had significant transient wall motion abnormalities. Patients with stroke with cerebral T waves, especially in those with ischemic strokes, should be assessed for cardiac dysfunction.\nDocument [2]: Title: Prognostic value of ST-T abnormalities and left high R waves with cardiovascular mortality in Japanese (24-year follow-up of NIPPON DATA80). Abstract: Little is known about the prognostic value of ST-segment depression and/or T wave (ST-T abnormalities) with or without left high R waves on electrocardiogram recorded at rest for death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Asian populations. Japanese participants without a history of CVD and free of major electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities were followed for 24 years. Subjects were divided into 4 groups based on baseline ECG findings: isolated left high R waves, isolated ST-T abnormalities, ST-T abnormalities with left high R waves, and normal electrocardiogram. Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate risk of CVD mortality in groups with ECG abnormalities compared to the normal group. Of 8,572 participants (44.4% men, mean age 49.5 years; 55.6% women, mean age 49.4 years), 1,142 had isolated left high R waves, 292 had isolated ST-T abnormalities, and 128 had ST-T abnormalities with left high R waves at baseline. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of ST-T abnormalities with left high R waves for CVD mortality were 1.95 (95% confidence interval 1.25 to 3.04) in men and 2.68 (95% confidence interval 1.81 to 3.97) in women. Isolated ST-T abnormalities increased the risk for CVD death by 1.66 times (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.71) in men and 1.62 times (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.24) in women. Association of ECG abnormalities with CVD mortality was independent of age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, blood glucose, smoking and drinking, and antihypertensive medication. In conclusion, ST-T abnormalities with or without left high R waves on electrocardiogram recorded at rest constitute an independent predictor of CVD mortality in Japanese men and women.\nDocument [3]: Title: Electrocardiogram in pneumonia. Abstract: Findings on electrocardiogram may hint that pulmonary embolism (PE) is present when interpreted in the proper context and lead to definitive imaging tests. However, it would be useful to know if electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities also occur in patients with pneumonia and whether these are similar to ECG changes with PE. The purpose of this investigation was to determine ECG findings in patients with pneumonia. We retrospectively evaluated 62 adults discharged with a diagnosis of pneumonia who had no previous cardiopulmonary disease and had electrocardiogram obtained during hospitalization. The most prevalent ECG abnormality, other than sinus tachycardia, was minor nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes occurring in 13 of 62 (21%). Right atrial enlargement occurred in 4 of 62 (6.5%). QRS abnormalities were observed in 24 of 62 (39%). Right-axis deviation and S(1)S(2)S(3) were the most prevalent QRS abnormalities, which occurred in 6 of 62 (9.7%). Complete right bundle branch block and S(1)Q(3)T(3) pattern occurred in 3 of 62 (4.8%). ECG abnormalities that were not present within 1 month previously or abnormalities that disappeared within 1 month included left-axis deviation, right-axis deviation, right atrial enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy, S(1)S(2)S(3), S(1)Q(3)T(3), low-voltage QRS complexes, and nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. In conclusion, electrocardiogram in patients with pneumonia often shows QRS abnormalities or nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes. ECG findings are similar to ECG abnormalities in PE and electrocardiogram cannot assist in the differential diagnosis.\nDocument [4]: Title: Factors associated with abnormal T-wave axis and increased QRS-T angle in type 2 diabetes. Abstract: Frontal plane T-wave axis and QRS-T angle are novel electrocardiographic ventricular repolarization parameters that have been scarcely evaluated in type 2 diabetes. The aim was to investigate the factors associated with these parameters of abnormal ventricular repolarization in a cross-sectional analysis of 594 patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinical, laboratory, 2D-echocardiographic, ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid ultrasonographic data were obtained. Digital 12-lead ECG was recorded, and frontal plane T-wave axis and QRS-T angle were automatically measured. T-wave axis was considered abnormal if >75\u00b0 or <15\u00b0 and QRS-T angle if \u226573\u00b0 in men and \u226567\u00b0 in woman. Associations were assessed by bivariate tests and multivariate logistic regressions. One hundred and four (20.9 %) patients had abnormal T-wave axis, and 84 (14 %) had increased QRS-T angle. Patients with abnormal ventricular repolarization were older and had greater prevalence of micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications than patients with normal repolarization. They had higher office and ambulatory BPs, greater prevalence of the non-dipping pattern, and greater left ventricular mass, aortic PWV and carotid intima-media thickness. On multivariate analysis, abnormal ventricular repolarization parameters were independently associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, non-dipping pattern, higher ambulatory systolic BPs, glycated hemoglobin and common carotid intima-media thickness, and with the presence of coronary artery disease. In conclusion, abnormal frontal plane T-wave axis and QRS-T angle are independently associated with several markers of pre-clinical atherosclerotic disease; whether these associations represent additional cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes shall be confirmed in prospective studies.\nDocument [5]: Title: [Repeated changes of electrocardiogram caused by Takotsubo-type cardiomyopathy: a case with hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy]. Abstract: A 67-year-old woman had been examined due to abnormalities on electrocardiography (ECG) at a medical checkup three years previously. When a negative T-wave was seen in leads I, aVL, and V1 to V4, but the abnormal findings were improved at consultation. Echocardiography revealed apical hypertrophy and hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy was diagnosed. She felt chest discomfort in September, 2003 and an ECG showed a negative T-wave in leads I, II, III aVL, aVF and V2 to V6 and an elongation of QT interval Left ventriculography revealed myocardial hypertrophy at the left ventricular apex and left ventriclar wall motion was normal. Coronary angiography did not show any significant luminal narrowing. I-123 metaiodobenzyl-guanitidine scintigraphy showed marked perfusion defects at the left ventricular apex. After five months, ECG showed an improvement of the QT interval and a decrease in the negative T-wave. We considered that the repeated changes of ECG were caused by Takotsubo-type cardiomyopathy.\nDocument [6]: Title: Commotio Cordis presenting as a temporary complete atrioventricular block in a 2-year-old girl with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Abstract: This report describes a 2-year-old girl with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) who presented with transient complete atrioventricular (AV) block after a mild chest blow. Running around the house with her older sister, she fell to the floor. Her sister also fell and landed on her. The girl became cyanotic and pale and experienced a transient loss of consciousness. At arrival to the emergency department, she had regained consciousness, but she remained pale. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated complete AV block with a heart rate of 78 beats per minute (bpm). The ECG after admission showed a Wenckebach-type second-degree AV block. Day 2 after admission, a 12-lead ECG showed significant ST and T-wave abnormalities in the precordial leads, but the girl had no chest pain and a normal physical examination. Echocardiography demonstrated normal contractility of the systemic right ventricle. The first-degree AV block and the ST and T-wave abnormalities on the 12-lead ECG improved gradually without abnormal Q-waves. This is the first report of ccTGA in which a transient complete AV block naturally recovered after a presentation with commotio cordis.\nDocument [7]: Title: Impact of the Location of ST-T Abnormalities Accompanying Minor Q-Waves on the Definition of Prior Myocardial Infarction. Abstract: According to the Fourth Universal Definition of myocardial infarction (MI), the likelihood of a previous MI is increased when ST-T abnormalities exist with minor Q-waves in the same leads. Therefore, we examined whether differences in location of ST-T abnormalities in relation to minor Q-waves as part of the old MI definition impact the prevalence and prognostic significance of MI. This analysis included 7,878 participants with available baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and follow-up data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Two ECG MI definitions were utilized; both were based on the standards of the Minnesota Code (MC) ECG Classification, and both incorporated major Q-waves but differed in whether major ST-T abnormalities and minor Q waves, as part of the definition, were in the same lead group (Standard MC-MI) or not (Fourth Universal MI). All-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality were ascertained during 14 years (median). We found no difference between baseline prevalence of Standard MC-MI (3.48%; n = 274) and Fourth Universal MI (3.27%; n = 258), p = 0.46. Also, Standard MC-MI and Fourth Universal MI were similarly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.64 [1.42 to 1.90] and 1.61 [1.38 to 1.87], respectively; p value for differences in associations = 0.86), and cardiovascular disease mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.99 [1.61 to 2.48] and 1.94 [1.56 to 2.42], respectively; p value for differences in associations = 0.84). In conclusion, the location of ST-T abnormalities accompanying minor Q-waves does not impact the prevalence or prognostic significance of a prior MI which raise doubts about the clinical impact of considering the location of ST-T in relation to minor Q-waves when defining an old MI.\nDocument [8]: Title: Secondly ECG recordings in the emergency room revealed Garenoxacin-induced abnormal QT interval prolongation in a patient with multiple syncopal attacks. Abstract: A 73-year-old woman first visited our emergency room with multiple syncopal attacks. Before admission, she had received an antibiotic (Garenoxacin) for 3 days from a local clinic. First electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no ST-segment deviation but mild QT interval prolongation with a positive U wave. Second ECG recording 3 h later showed slightly slower heart rate and revealed marked QTU interval prolongation suggesting the cause of her syncopal attacks. After cessation of Garenoxacin, the QTU interval prolongation shortened. However, both epinephrine infusion and treadmill exercise test reproduced similar QTU interval prolongation and T wave deformities. Later, genetic analysis demonstrated that this patient had a mutation in KCNH2 gene, and she was diagnosed as a type-2 long-QT syndrome which was accentuated by use of garenoxacin. At the emergency out-patient clinic, repetitive ECG recordings can be useful and should be considered in order to identify the cause of syncopal attacks in patients who were prescribed antibiotics and had mild QT interval abnormalities.\nDocument [9]: Title: Value of the Electrocardiographic (P Wave, T Wave, QRS) Axis as a Predictor of Mortality in 14 Years in a Population With a High Prevalence of Chagas Disease from the Bambu\u00ed Cohort Study of Aging. Abstract: We sought to investigate the prognostic value of the electrocardiogram (ECG) electrical axes (P wave, T wave and QRS) as predictors of mortality in the 14-year follow-up of the prospective cohort of all residents \u226560 years living in the southeastern Brazilian city of Bambu\u00ed, a population with high prevalence of Chagas disease (ChD). Baseline ECG axes were automatically measured with normal values defined as follows: P-wave axis 0\u00b0 to 75\u00b0, QRS axis -30\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, and T axis 15\u00b0 to 75\u00b0. Participants underwent annual follow-up visits and death was verified using death certificates. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the prognostic value of ECG axes for all-cause mortality, after adjustment for potential confounders. From 1,742 qualifying residents, 1,462 were enrolled, of whom 557 (38.1%) had ChD. Mortality rate was 51.9%. In multivariable adjusted models, abnormal P-wave axis was associated with a 48% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.88]) increased mortality risk in patients with ChD and 43% (HR = 1.43 [CI 1.13-1.81]) in patients without ChD. Abnormal QRS axis was associated with a 34% (HR = 1.34 [CI 1.04-1.73]) increased mortality risk in patients with ChD, but not in individuals without ChD. Similarly, in the ChD group, abnormal T-wave axis was associated with a 35% (HR = 1.35 [CI 1.07-1.71]) increased mortality, but not in patients without ChD. In conclusion, abnormal P-wave, QRS, and T-wave axes were associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with ChD. Abnormal P-wave axis was associated with mortality also among those without ChD, being the strongest predictor among ECG variables.\nDocument [10]: Title: T-wave Inversions in Cerebellar and Occipital Lobe Infarcts in the Setting of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Suggestive of Paradoxical Emboli: A Case Report. Abstract: Cardiological causes account for the majority of acute electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. The reason for this fear is the irreversibility of myocardial necrosis. Generally, various changes can be observed in the ECG, including ST-T changes, QTc prolongation, arrhythmias, and T-wave inversions. Even though T-wave inversions can be seen in myocardial ischemia/infarction, they are rarely seen in acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). We present the case of a 66-year-old woman who initially presented at our facility with dizziness in the context of orthostatic hypotension. An initial cardiac evaluation revealed no cardiac involvement. She was treated with intravenous fluids (IVF), which improved her symptoms. The patient's mental status was markedly altered approximately four days after admission. In this instance, she was found to have abnormal ECG findings (not previously observed on the ECG that was obtained on the day of admission), elevated troponin T levels, as well as elevated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP). The patient was given aspirin and clopidogrel immediately and was placed on a heparin drip for a suspected non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). A non-contrast computed tomography of the head revealed an acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA), following which the heparin drip was stopped. The patient was then transferred to another acute care facility capable of performing neurosurgical interventions. Additionally, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest and lower extremities venous duplex showed bilateral pulmonary emboli and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), respectively.\nDocument [11]: Title: Diffuse Deep T-Wave Inversions Following a Generalized Seizure. Abstract: BACKGROUND Stress cardiomyopathy (SCM) is a transient dysfunction of the left ventricle due to physical or emotional triggers that produces a range of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. While ST-segment elevation or depression often leads to more urgent investigation and diagnosis, T-wave inversions can result in delayed diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 44-year-old woman with a prior left middle cerebral artery septic embolic stroke from endocarditis resulting in residual dense right sided hemiparesis and aphasia was admitted to the hospital for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. While hospitalized, she experienced a generalized seizure that was aborted with lorazepam and then loaded with phenytoin. Her ECG following the seizure showed a prolonged QT interval, for which her methadone that she was stabilized on during hospitalization was held. Her ECG to follow-up on her QT interval 25 h following the seizure showed new diffuse symmetric deep T-wave inversions. While initially believed to be due to the either the discontinuation of methadone or initiation of phenytoin, retrospective analysis revealed that these changes were more suggestive of a missed SCM. CONCLUSIONS We report a patient who experienced a generalized seizure resulting in diffuse, symmetric, deep T-wave inversions that were incorrectly attributed to medication effects before identifying the likely diagnosis of SCM. Fortunately for this patient, there were no consequences of the delayed diagnosis, but this case emphasises the importance of considering SCM following a generalized seizure in any patient with ECG abnormalities.\nDocument [12]: Title: Electrocardiographic findings and myocardial damage in acute myocarditis detected by cardiac magnetic resonance. Abstract: Delayed-contrast-enhancement (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify areas of myocardial damage in patients with acute myocarditis (AM). The aim of this study was to assess the electrocardiographic findings in AM diagnosed by DCE-MRI. Eighty-one patients (72 men, 35 \u00b1 13 years) with AM were prospectively enrolled. All of them underwent MRI and 12-lead-ECG recordings. In the admission electrocardiogram (ECG 1), as well as in that obtained 48 h later (ECG 2), the following parameters were analyzed: rhythm, PR, QRS, and QTc-intervals, intraventricular conduction, abnormal Q waves, ST segment elevation, and T wave inversion. On admission, 77 patients (95%) were in sinus rhythm, while four patients (6%) manifested severe arrhythmias. No difference between ECG 1 and ECG 2 was observed regarding abnormal Q waves, PR, QRS, and QTc-intervals. Electrocardiogram 1 was normal in 26 patients (32%, normal ECG group), and abnormal in 55 patients (68%, abnormal ECG group). ST elevation was found in 46 patients (57%), inverted T wave in seven patients (9%) and left bundle branch block (LBBB) in two patients (3%). Areas of DCE suggesting AM were found in each patient. No relationship concerning the location of the involved region (s) was found between ECG (leads with ST/T abnormalities) and MRI (areas showing DCE). The ECG in AM can either be normal or reflect abnormalities including arrhythmias, LBBB, ST segment elevation, and T wave inversion. The location of myocardial involvement deduced on the basis of ECG leads showing ST/T changes is not in close relationship with the areas of ventricular damage detected by MRI.\nDocument [13]: Title: [Electrocardiographic diagnosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome]. Abstract: Electrocardiographic role in a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease has still important value. As important electrocardiographic findings of myocardial ischemia, there are ST elevation or depression, increase high T wave (hyperacute T wave), negative T wave and negative U wave, but it is particularly important to compare those findings and manifestation. Because the patient can always carry it, event ECG is advantageous in that they can record electrocardiography by themselves when they have some symptom. It is necessary to have attention to what abnormal findings of the electrocardiogram which it is easy to be overlooked such as increase T wave or negative U wave appear in early stage of phase of acute coronary syndrome. When the patient has some symptom that acute coronary syndrome is thought about, it is necessary to record electrocardiograms on several times and to do follow up even if there is no electorcardiographic abnormalities at first recording.\nDocument [14]: Title: ECG T-wave monitor for potential early detection and diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias. Abstract: T-wave abnormalities are gaining significance in the realm of electrocardiogram diagnostics. In particular, T-wave alternans are proving to be powerful predictive indicators of potentially fatal arrhythmias. T-wave morphology monitoring and analysis are the means by which alternans and other abnormalities are detected. We have presented a preliminary design of an analog T-wave monitor to provide a characteristic description of the beat-to-beat T-wave morphology in terms of its maximum leading edge and trailing edge slopes, and its area. Experimental results showed that data from the analog T-wave monitor compared well with those predicted theoretically. Current design of the T-wave monitor, once improved, can find use in the screening, diagnosis, and early detection of T-wave abnormalities in clinical settings.\nDocument [15]: Title: Evaluation and comparison of the Minnesota Code and Novacode for electrocardiographic Q-ST wave abnormalities for the independent prediction of incident coronary heart disease and total mortality (from the Women's Health Initiative). Abstract: Electrocardiographic (ECG) Q- and ST-T-wave abnormalities predict coronary heart disease (CHD) and total mortality. No comparison has been made of the classification of these abnormalities by the 2 most widely used ECG coding systems for epidemiologic studies-the Minnesota Code (MC) and Novacode (NC). We evaluated 12-lead electrocardiograms from 64,597 participants (49 to 79 years old, 82% non-Hispanic white) in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial in 1993 to 1998, with a maximum of 11 years of follow-up. We used MC and NC criteria to identify Q-wave, ST-segment, and T-wave abnormalities for comparison. In total, 3,322 participants (5.1%) died during an average 8-year follow-up, and 1,314 had incident CHD in the baseline cardiovascular disease-free group. Independently, ECG myocardial infarction criteria by the MC or NC were generally equivalent and were strong predictors for CHD death and total mortality (hazard ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.51 for CHD death; hazard ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.71 for total mortality) in a multivariable analytic model. Electrocardiograms with major ST-T abnormalities by the MC or NC coding system were stronger in predicting CHD deaths and total mortality than was the presence of Q waves alone. In conclusion, the ECG classification systems for myocardial infarction/ischemia abnormalities from the MC and NC are valuable and useful in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. ST-T abnormalities are stronger predictors for CHD events and total mortality than isolated Q-wave abnormalities.\nDocument [16]: Title: Isolated deep T-wave inversion on an electrocardiogram with normal wall motion. Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) of a 73-year-old, asymptomatic woman showed deep T-wave inversion. The complete workup was negative. Ten years later, she developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy with abnormal ECG again. Isolated deep T-wave inversion might be an aftereffect of takotsubo cardiomyopathy that does not warrant an invasive workup.\nDocument [17]: Title: Differences in the diagnostic value of various criteria of negative T waves for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on a molecular genetic diagnosis. Abstract: Differences in the diagnostic value of a variety of definitions of negative T waves for HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) have not yet been clarified, resulting in a number of definitions being applied in previous studies. The aim of the present study was to determine the most accurate diagnostic definition of negative T waves for HCM in genotyped populations. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings were analysed in 161 genotyped subjects (97 carriers and 64 non-carriers). We applied three different criteria that have been used in previous studies: Criterion 1, negative T wave >10 mm in depth in any leads; Criterion 2, negative T wave >3 mm in depth in at least two leads; and Criterion 3, negative T wave >1 mm in depth in at least two leads. Of the three criteria, Criterion 3 had the highest sensitivity (43% compared with 5 and 26% in Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 respectively; P<0.0001) and retained a specificity of 95%, resulting in the highest accuracy. In comparison with abnormal Q waves, negative T waves for Criterion 3 had a lower sensitivity in detecting carriers without LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) (12.9% for negative T waves compared with 22.6% for abnormal Q waves). On the other hand, in detecting carriers with LVH, the sensitivity of negative T waves increased in a stepwise direction with the increasing extent of LVH (P<0.001), whereas there was less association between the sensitivity of abnormal Q waves and the extent of LVH. In conclusion, Criterion 3 for negative T waves may be the most accurate definition of HCM based on genetic diagnoses. Negative T waves may show different diagnostic value according to the different criteria and phenotypes in genotyped populations with HCM.\nDocument [18]: Title: Assessing common classification methods for the identification of abnormal repolarization using indicators of T-wave morphology and QT interval. Abstract: Various parameters based on QTc and T-wave morphology have been shown to be useful discriminators for drug induced I(Kr)-blocking. Using different classification methods this study compares the potential of these two features for identifying abnormal repolarization on the ECG. A group of healthy volunteers and LQT2 carriers were used to train classification algorithms using measures of T-wave morphology and QTc. The ability to correctly classify a third group of test subjects before and after receiving d,l-sotalol was evaluated using classification rules derived from training. As a single electrocardiographic feature, T-wave morphology separates normal from abnormal repolarization better than QTc. It is further indicated that nonlinear boundaries can provide stronger classifiers than a linear boundaries. Whether this is true in general with other ECG markers and other data sets is uncertain because the approach has not been tested in this setting.\nDocument [19]: Title: Relations between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and T Wave abnormalities in subjects without clinically-apparent cardiovascular disease (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [MESA]). Abstract: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that depression and anxiety are associated with electrocardiographic (ECG) repolarization abnormalities in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a cohort free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. Depressive symptoms were assessed by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and trait anxiety symptoms by using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; both were categorized according to uppermost quartile. T-wave inversions in ECG leads other than V1 to V3 were obtained from electrocardiograms obtained at rest during the baseline examination. Participants with major intraventricular conduction abnormalities and those taking antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, and/or antipsychotics were excluded. Logistic regression models were estimated with multivariable adjustment for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 5,906 participants, elevated depressive symptoms were associated with increased odds of T-wave inversion after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 3.06, p = 0.001), whereas greater trait anxiety was associated with reduced odds of T-wave inversion (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.77, p = 0.003). The divergent associations of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety with ECG T-wave inversions were similar in men and women, and these associations were present across the racial and ethnic subgroups (non-Hispanic white, African-American, Hispanic, and Chinese). In conclusion, symptoms of depression and anxiety were independently yet oppositely associated with ECG T-wave inversions. Negative emotions may have a differential impact on cardiovascular mortality through unique relations with cardiac repolarization.\nDocument [20]: Title: Electrocardiographic abnormalities in a patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Abstract: A 69-year-old woman presented after collapsing. She denied chest pain, breathlessness or headache. She was afebrile and vital signs were unremarkable. She was confused but the remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Routine blood tests were unremarkable. Cardiac enzymes were raised with a troponin I of 0.54. ECG showed Q waves in leads V1-V3 and widespread T wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF and V1-V6. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was suspected and antiplatelet treatment started. The following day her confusion worsened. Further review of the ECG found extensive changes unexplained by occlusion of a single artery suggesting extra-cardiac pathology. An urgent CT head was arranged and revealed subarachnoid haemorrhage. ACS treatment was stopped and she was transferred to neurosurgery where her right posterior communicating artery aneurysm was coiled. Fortunately her recovery was uneventful and she was discharged home with no neurological impairment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: <b><i>Background:</i></b> There is a growing body of evidence that ovarian cystectomy may negatively impact ovarian reserve. However, it is unclear whether ovarian cyst surgery puts women at risk of future infertility. This study investigates whether surgery for benign ovarian cysts is associated with long-term infertility risk. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Women aged 22-45 years (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;1,537) were invited to participate in an interview about their reproductive histories, including whether they ever had infertility or ovarian cyst surgery. Each woman reporting cyst surgery was randomly matched to a comparison woman, who was assigned an artificial surgery age equal to that of her match. Matching was repeated 1,000 times. Adjusted Cox models were fit to examine time to infertility after surgery for each match. A subset of women was invited to participate in a clinic visit to assess markers of ovarian reserve (anti-M&#252;llerian hormone [AMH], antral follicle count). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Approximately 6.1% of women reported cyst surgery. Infertility after surgery was more common for women reporting cyst surgery than those without surgery after adjusting for age, race, body mass index, cancer history, parity before assigned surgery age, history of infertility before surgery age, and endometriosis (median-adjusted hazard ratio 2.41, 95% simulation interval 1.03-6.78). The estimated geometric mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) AMH levels of those who reported a history of ovarian cyst surgery were 1.08 (95% CI: 0.57-2.05) times those of women who reported no history of surgery. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Those with a history of ovarian cyst surgery were more likely to report having a history of infertility compared with age-matched women who reported no history of cyst surgery. It is possible that both ovarian surgery to remove cysts and the conditions that lead women to develop cysts requiring surgery may affect subsequent successful conception.\nDocument [2]: Title: Giant Ovarian Mucinous Cystadenoma Complicating Term Pregnancy. Abstract: Huge ovarian cyst are found in less than 1% of all ovarian cyst in pregnancy and are associated with poor feto-maternal outcome. A 28 years old G2P1 with history of normal vaginal delivery 3 years back was referred from local health post with complains of intermittent pain abdomen at 29 weeks. Her scan showed huge ovarian cyst of 18.9\u00d717.6 cm with multiple thick septation. Woman was conservatively managed till term and elective surgery was planned however she presented in labour with breech presentation at 39 weeks and 4days. Emergency lower segment caesarian section along with left sided salpingo-oophorectomy was done along with delivery of 2.5 kg healthy female baby. Histopathology was suggestive of mucinous cystadenoma of ovary. Although antepartum removal of ovarian cyst has been recommended to ensure good pregnancy outcome, expectant management and timed intervention can be adopted for pregnancy with huge ovarian cysts. Keywords: mucinous cystadenoma; ovarian cyst; pregnancy.\nDocument [3]: Title: Torsion of ovarian cyst during pregnancy: a case report. Abstract: In this case we report a 23 -year-old primigravida with 30 weeks presenting with torsion of the ovarian cyst. She presented to the antenatal clinic with acute pain abdomen. She was diagnosed to have torsion of ovarian cyst during pregnancy and a cystecomy was carried out. Her histopathology report showed a benign serous cystadenoma. Her pregnancy was followed up. She delivered a healthy female baby at term. Although the safety of antepartum surgical intervention has been accepted, abdominal surgery nevertheless carries some risks to a pregnant woman and unborn fetus, and so the choice of management necessitates a weighing of risks based on characterization of the adnexal mass and gestational age.\nDocument [4]: Title: Borderline paratubal cyst: a case report. Abstract: Borderline para-ovarian cysts (PCs) are rare entities. They are commonly present in the third decade. Borderline PCs are often discovered fortuitously on routine ultrasound examination or they are common incidental findings during a laparotomy. They must be differentiated from simple ovarian cysts, peritoneal inclusion cysts and hydrosalpinges on ultrasound sonography. Papillary projections on the cyst wall should be searched carefully to suggest diagnosis. The treatment is surgical including fertility -sparing operation or more radical surgery depending on the case. The prognosis is good because borderline PCs are usually early-stage at diagnosis. Here is a report of a 38- year old woman with a borderline paratubal cyst. Adnexal torsion of hydrosalpinx was suspected; thus, she underwent an urgent surgery. Cystectomy was performed without rupture. The final diagnosis revealed a borderline PC. The patient underwent a radical surgery. Currently, she has had no evidence of disease recurrence.\nDocument [5]: Title: Pyomyoma mimicking tubo-ovarian abscess: Two case reports. Abstract: Pyomyoma is an extremely rare complication, defined as an infection of a uterine leiomyoma. We describe two cases of pyomyoma that were initially considered to be tubo-ovarian abscesses but were later diagnosed as pyomyomas and managed with laparoscopic surgery. Case 1 was a 26-year-old nulliparous woman who was previously diagnosed with bilateral endometriomas and presented to the hospital with lower abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral endometrial cysts and a 4-cm mass consistent with a tubo-ovarian abscess. The patient experienced continuous pain, and the cyst in the left adnexa enlarged; thus, laparoscopic surgery was performed. The cystic tumor in her uterus contained purulent fluid. Therefore, an abscess in the degenerative subserous myoma was diagnosed. Case 2 was a 47-year-old nulliparous woman who had undergone total mastectomy and postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer. She was undergoing hormone therapy when she presented to the hospital with lower abdominal pain, fever, and increased inflammatory markers. Computed tomography revealed a 7-cm tumor with rim enhancement in her left adnexa; therefore, a tubo-ovarian abscess was suspected. After admission, drainage was performed under transvaginal ultrasound guidance, and antibiotics were administered. However, these treatments did not relieve her abdominal pain. Emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed, and intraoperative findings demonstrated an abscess in the degenerative subserous myoma of the uterus with normal adnexa. Laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy were performed. Laparoscopic surgery was effective for both patients. Delayed diagnosis of pyomyoma can result in serious complications. Timely surgery with concomitant antibiotic treatment may facilitate good outcomes.\nDocument [6]: Title: [Pelvic inflammatory disease and an abscessed endometriosis cyst: a diagnostic problem and a therapeutic dilemma]. Abstract: A 52-year-old woman with known endometriosis was treated with a levonorgestrel-containing IUD for irregular vaginal blood loss. Two weeks later she was admitted with signs ofpelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and was treated with antibiotics. As no clinical improvement ensued, laparoscopy was performed which demonstrated an infected endometriosis cyst in her right ovary. Ovariectomy was performed. In a 29-year-old woman with a symptomatic endometriosis cyst in the right ovary, PID was also suspected. After an initially good response to antibiotic therapy her condition deteriorated. Laparotomy revealed an infected endometriosis cyst. It was drained with subsequent cystectomy. A third, 43-year-old, woman with known endometriosis was admitted with signs of PID. Although she had a good clinical response to antibiotic therapy, her C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained elevated. Diagnostic laparoscopy demonstrated a large abscess in the right ovary. Ovariectomy was performed. Histology showed signs of an infected endometriosis cyst. All these women presented with PID and, in addition, a cystic adnexal mass on ultrasonography. The incidence oftubo-ovarian and ovarian abscesses is higher in the presence of an endometriosis cyst. Irrespective of the presence of an endometriosis cyst, antibiotics should be the first line of treatment. Reduction in the size of the abscess is not a useful parameter for monitoring conservative treatment when an infected endometriosis cyst is present. If it is decided to perform surgery on the infected endometriosis cyst, drainage of the abscess is usually not sufficient: excision of the endometriosis cyst is the only adequate therapy.\nDocument [7]: Title: A clinically functioning gonadotroph adenoma presenting with abdominal pain, ovarian hyperstimulation and fibromatosis. Abstract: Pituitary adenomas can be classified as functioning or non-functioning adenomas. Approximately 64% of clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas are found to be gonadotroph adenomas on immunohistochemistry. There are reported cases of gonadotroph adenomas causing clinical symptoms, but this is unusual. We present the case of a 36-year-old female with abdominal pain. Multiple large ovarian cysts were identified on ultrasound requiring bilateral cystectomy. Despite this, the cysts recurred resulting in further abdominal pain, ovarian torsion and right oophorectomy and salpingectomy. On her 3rd admission with abdominal pain, she was found to have a rectus sheath mass which was resected and histologically confirmed to be fibromatosis. Endocrine investigations revealed elevated oestradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) at the upper limit of the normal range and a suppressed luteinising hormone (LH). Prolactin was mildly elevated. A diagnosis of an FSH-secreting pituitary adenoma was considered and a pituitary MRI revealed a 1.5 cm macroadenoma. She underwent transphenoidal surgery which led to resolution of her symptoms and normalisation of her biochemistry. Subsequent pelvic ultrasound showed normal ovarian follicular development. Clinically functioning gonadotroph adenomas are rare, but should be considered in women presenting with menstrual irregularities, large or recurrent ovarian cysts, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and fibromatosis. Transphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment with the aim of achieving complete remission. Learning points: Pituitary gonadotroph adenomas are usually clinically non-functioning, but in rare cases can cause clinical symptoms. A diagnosis of a functioning gonadotroph adenoma should be considered in women presenting with un-explained ovarian hyperstimulation and/or fibromatosis. In women with functioning gonadotroph adenomas, the main biochemical finding is elevated oestradiol levels. Serum FSH levels can be normal or mildly elevated. Serum LH levels are usually suppressed. Transphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment for patients with functioning gonadotroph adenomas, with the aim of achieving complete remission.\nDocument [8]: Title: Rare clinical features of the Ellis van Creveld syndrome: A case report and literature review. Abstract: Ellis van Creveld syndrome (EVC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder also called chondroectodermal dysplasia. This study reports on a 40-year-old woman from Iran with a syndromic appearance consisting of a coarse face, conical anterior teeth, dental agenesis and permanent teeth at birth, several small extralabial, nonmidline frenula with a high-arched palate, and a large maxillary labial frenulum. The patient had cyanosis on her lips since childhood and a history of adenoid tonsillectomy surgery. She also had androgenic alopecia, an elongated trunk with excessive lordosis and pectus excavatum, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and a history of two periods in a month. She also had multiple fibrocystic cysts in her breasts, lower extremity deformity, dysplastic genu valgum, and short limb dwarfism; she had undergone left knee surgery four times and had severe osteoporosis in some of her bones and some hyperpigmented patches on the dorsal of the left hand. Her hands and feet were also wide and markedly deformed with hypoplastic fingernails and toenails, and she had bimanual hexadactyly on the ulnar side of the hands. She also had a history of severe hypotension and cyanosis during surgery and suffered from congenital heart failure and had undergone open heart surgery for correcting her atrial heart defect. In this study pectus excavatum, Phrygian cap gallbladder, liver hemangioma, polycystic ovarian disease, and breast fibrocystic cysts was reported for first time in this case of EVC syndrome. This case was reported and all articles regarding common, uncommon, rare, and extremely rare presentations of this syndrome were reviewed.\nDocument [9]: Title: [Effect of laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy on ovarian reserve and the outcomes of in vitro fertilization patients with benign ovarian cysts]. Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the effect of laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy on anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level, ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and pregnancy rate for in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients with benign ovarian cysts. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with benign ovarian cysts who were admitted for cystectomy and had undergone IVF treatment were enrolled in the study. There were 373 participants with ovarian cysts underwent laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy in the experimental group. According to duration of post-surgery, there were four sub-groups: 1 year post-surgery (1Y POST), 2 years post-surgery (2Y POST), 4 years post-surgery (4Y POST) and &#8805;5 years post-surgery (&#8805;5Y POST) in the experimental group. According to histopathologic types of ovarian cysts, there were two sub-groups: ovarian endometriotic cysts and ovarian non-endometriotic cysts. Two hundreds and three patients with no history of ovarian cysts and ovarian surgery were in the control group. The level of AMH and basic concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone (P), estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) were measured. Antral follicle counts (AFC) were calculated. There were other study variables: total dose of gonadotropins, duration of ovarian stimulation, the number of oocyte retrieved, the number of embryo obtained, blastocyst transfer rate and pregnancy rate. <b>Results:</b> The control group was matched as closely as possible to the experimental group, including age, body mass index and menstrual cycle (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). Compared to the women in control group, the women in ovarian endometriotic cystectomy sub-group had significantly higher levels of basal FSH and basal P, lower level of AMH (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05); the women in ovarian endometriotic cysts sub-group had significantly higher dose of gonadotropins (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05); the women in ovarian endometriotic cysts &#8805;5Y POST sub-group had significantly lower number of oocyte retrieved, lower number of embryo obtained, lower blastocyst transfer rate, and lower pregnancy rate (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Compared to the women in control group, the women in ovarian non-endometriotic cysts sub-group had a significantly higher level of basal FSH and basal P (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The women in ovarian non-endometriotic cysts sub-group had lower level of AMH, higher dose of gonadotropins, lower number of oocyte retrieved, lower number of embryo obtained, lower rate of blastocyst transfer and lower rate of pregnancy than the control group but there were no statistically significant differences among them (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). The women with unilateral ovarian endometriotic cysts had significantly lower number of oocyte retrieved on the side of surgery than another side (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> In short term laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy has no significant effect on ovarian reserve. But with long-term follow-up ovarian reserve, ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and pregnancy rate are decreased. The effect of laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy in benign cysts on ovarian is associated with whether or not it is the surgical side.\nDocument [10]: Title: Vanishing large ovarian cyst with thyroxine therapy. Abstract: A 21-year-old female patient recently diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism was found to have a large ovarian cyst. In view of the large ovarian cyst, she was advised to undergo elective laparotomy in the gynaecology department. She was further evaluated in our medical out-patient department (OPD), and elective surgery was withheld. She was started on thyroxine replacement therapy, and within a period of 4 months, the size of the cyst regressed significantly, thereby improving the condition of the patient significantly. This case report highlights the rare and often missed association between hypothyroidism and ovarian cysts. Although very rare, profound hypothyroidism that can cause ovarian cysts in an adult should always be kept in the differential diagnosis to avoid unnecessary ovarian surgery.\nDocument [11]: Title: [Malignant teratoma: about a case and a review of the literature]. Abstract: Dermoid cysts account for 10-20% of ovarian germ cell tumors. Malignant transformation within ovarian dermoid cyst has been reported in 1-2 per cent of the cases. The treatment remains controversial. In women of childbearing age and in the first stages of the disease unilateral annexectomy without adjuvant therapy is recommended. In menopausal women extensive surgery is sometimes performed, no matter what stage of the disease the person is experiencing. We report the case of a menopausal patient with malignant transformation within ovarian dermoid cyst who underwent surgery. She had a favorable outcome.\nDocument [12]: Title: What is the best management strategy for a 20-year-old woman with premature ovarian failure? Abstract: The diagnosis of premature ovarian failure (POF) for a 20-year-old woman is devastating and will impact on many areas of her life. She deserves prompt confirmation of the diagnosis and accurate, honest information about the condition including the chances of conception and long-term health issues. She should be offered investigation of aetiology, although this may be hard to establish, and assessment of associated medical conditions. Oestrogen replacement should be advised for long-term use until the normal age of menopause, and she should be fully counselled on the benefits and risks of hormone replacement and her options of which preparation to take. Long-term follow-up is needed, and this is likely to require multidisciplinary input, including that from a gynaecologist, clinical psychologist and fertility team. POF may not be the appropriate terminology for this condition. Ovarian function often fluctuates in young women with POF, who may continue to menstruate occasionally and even conceive spontaneously. In view of this unpredictability, 'premature ovarian insufficiency' is a better description of the condition and carries a less negative connotation than 'ovarian failure' which can cause great distress. We recommend that the condition is termed 'premature ovarian insufficiency' (Clinical Endocrinology 2008;68:499).\nDocument [13]: Title: Laparoscopic Surgery for Ovarian Cyst Infection with Avoidance of Ureteral Injury and Uterine Perforation following Intrauterine Insemination after Abdominal Modified Radical Trachelectomy. Abstract: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) sometimes develops after intrauterine insemination (IUI). We herein present a case of PID which developed after IUI performed after abdominal modified radical trachelectomy (AmRT) and was treated with laparoscopic surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of laparoscopic surgery for PID that occurred after AmRT in Japan. A 39-year-old woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer stage IA1 with lymphovascular invasion underwent AmRT and pelvic lymphadenectomy. At 3 years and 6 months after the surgery, she had fever and pain in her left lower abdomen 10 days after IUI. She was diagnosed with PID with left ovarian cyst infection and underwent laparoscopic left ovarian cystectomy. Before surgery, bilateral ureteral catheters were inserted because of possible difficulty identifying the ureters. During surgery, severe adhesion was seen in the pelvic cavity. By moving the catheters manually back and forth from outside the body, we were able to identify the ureters visually. A uterine manipulator was inserted during surgery, rather than before surgery, to avoid the risk of uterine perforation. Laparoscopic surgery with ureteral catheters and a uterine manipulator can be applied safely for such cases after AmRT even when severe intraperitoneal adhesion is present.\nDocument [14]: Title: Stage IVA ovarian cancer one year following the third In Vitro Fertilisation procedure. Abstract: Ovarian cancer is the second biggest cause of gynaecological cancer related death in elderly women which is uncommon during reproductive age. We, herein present a thought-provoking case of an infertile woman who was diagnosed with stage IVA ovarian cancer just one year after the In Vitro Fertilisation cycles. A 37-year-old woman with secondary infertility who underwent three cycles of ovarian stimulation, had two grade II cleavage-stage embryos transferred, though they did not result in pregnancy in two years. During the IVF treatment, ovarian cyst puncture was performed and no malignant cells were observed. The following year, she suffered from abdominal pain with extremely elevated tumour markers and stage IVA ovarian carcinoma was confirmed by transabdominal operation. The patient underwent cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy; however, she was insensitive to postoperative chemotherapy with poor CA 125. The case aroused high attention regarding safety of IVF including standardisation and close long-term follow-up.\nDocument [15]: Title: Ovarian cyst removal influences ovarian reserve dependent on histology, size and type of operation. Abstract: Previous publications suggest a reduction in the ovarian reserve following ovarian surgery. The influence of the underlying disease, histology, size of the ovarian cyst and type of procedure remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of an ovarian operation on the ovarian reserve, based on the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone levels. The anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone values were determined by means of a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In total, 52 patients with one or more ovarian cysts of different histologic entities treated at the Department of Women's Health at the Women's University Hospital in T\u00fcbingen were included in the study. Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone was determined before and after surgery. The patients were 28 (range = 18-40) years old on average. There was a statistically significant decrease in anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone from 3.94 \u00b1 3.18 to 3.14 \u00b1 2.57 ng/mL (p = 0.001). In 80.8%, the cysts were unilateral, and in over 90.4%, a complete cyst extirpation was performed. A statistically significant reduction was seen in follicular cysts (4.72 \u00b1 3.84 to 3.76 \u00b1 2.91 ng/mL; p = 0.039) and endometriosis cysts (2.55 \u00b1 1.87 to 1.72 \u00b1 1.39 ng/mL; p = 0.024). Also, the size of the cysts had an influence on the ovarian reserve, only larger ovarian cysts with a diameter of 5 cm or more showed a statistically significant reduction in anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone. Our data showed a significant decrease in anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone levels after surgery on the ovaries. If this results in a long-term reduced ovarian reserve or is merely a short-term reaction to the procedure needs to be clarified. However, concerning young women, the indication of surgery should be given cautiously as-at least temporarily-a reduction in the ovarian reserve can occur.\nDocument [16]: Title: Endometriosis surgery and preservation of fertility, what surgeons should know. Abstract: Colorectal surgeons often participate in the multidisciplinary management of young females with endometriosis. Complications of endometriosis as well as its management often result in infertility since they can involve all pelvic organs including the procreative organs: uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Complete excision of all endometriotic lesions should not be performed at the expense of irreversible destruction of the procreative organs; definitive infertility should not be the price to pay in order to obtain an improvement of the painful symptoms caused by endometriosis. Surgery for ovarian endometriomas should be specifically adapted to the patient's desire for future conception and to her preoperative ovarian reserve. Two main techniques are used to treat ovarian endometriomas: ovarian cystectomy excises the wall of the cyst while ablation consists of destruction of the internal surface of the cyst. The use of mono polar or biolar coagulation for cyst ablation is strongly contra-indicated. Ablation using laser or plasma energy has resulted in comparable rates of post-operative pregnancy to those obtained by ovarian cystectomy. Patients who wish to delay their attempt to conceive for some period of time, should be placed on long-term oral contraception with prevention of menstruation to reduce the risk of recurrent endometriosis. When surgery for colorectal endometriosis is necessary, the laparoscopic approach increases the chances of spontaneous conception compared to laparotomy. Surgery for deep-seated endometriosis has been accompanied by a high rate of spontaneous conception and successful pregnancy and does not seem to decrease the chances for conception by in vitro fertilization.\nDocument [17]: Title: Immature teratoma after three laparoscopic resections for mature cystic teratomas. Abstract: We report a case in which an immature teratoma developed following three previous resections for mature cystic teratomas. The patient was a 26-year-old nulliparous woman with a regular menstrual cycle. Twelve years earlier, she had consulted a pediatrician for complaints of lower abdominal pain. Bilateral cystic teratomas were suspected and she underwent a left salpingo-oophorectomy and a right cystectomy laparoscopically, and bilateral mature cystic teratomas were diagnosed histologically. She underwent a right cystectomy twice afterwards and mature cystic teratomas were diagnosed. Three years after the third surgery, a regular checkup performed annually for ovarian cyst recurrence revealed a 9.3 cm ovarian cyst by ultrasonography without marker elevation or complaint of symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 10 cm multilocular cyst, including a part with heterogeneous medium and high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images, which revealed enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI unlike the previous images. Ovarian tumors, including immature teratomas and malignancy, were considered. She had a strong wish to undergo laparoscopic surgery. She was diagnosed with an immature teratoma, grade 1 of the right ovary. Although the frequency of recurrence of immature teratomas after resection of mature cystic teratomas is very low, regular checkups are necessary because there may be no associated symptoms.\nDocument [18]: Title: [Neuro-endoscopic Management of Intraparenchymal Arachnoid Cyst in Adults:Three Case Reports]. Abstract: We report 3 cases of symptomatic intraparenchymal arachnoid cysts in adults, including 2 in elderly patients. Case 1:An 81-year-old woman developed right-sided hemiparesis and hemianopsia due to the enlargement of left occipital arachnoid cyst, which had been incidentally diagnosed 3 years ago. Under the guidance of neuronavigation, we inserted a rigid endoscope into the cyst and perforated the cyst wall toward the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, making a good communication between the cyst and the ventricle for cerebrospinal fluid. Her symptoms improved within 3 days after the surgery, and the cyst mass reduced. Case 2:A 57-year-old woman was incidentally found to have a right frontal arachnoid cyst. She had a 3-month long history of low mood and loss of interest in work. We perforated the transparent septum via the cyst wall toword the left lateral ventricle in a neuro-endoscopic procedure. After the surgery, she regained interest in work, and her symptom was considered to be indicative of depression due to arachnoid cyst. Case 3:A 94-year-old woman in a geriatric facility developed left-sided hemiparesis due to the enlargement of a right temporal arachnoid cyst, which had been detected 10 years ago. Neuro-endoscopic perforation of the cyst wall toward the lateral ventricle remarkably improved her symptoms. Arachnoid cysts can become symptomatic in the long term, not only in the young but also in the elderly. Neuro-endoscopic fenestration is an effective treatment for symptomatic intraparenchymal cysts, especially in elderly patients. The neuronavigation system was useful in the planning of the trajectory and in the detection of the target point of fenestration.\nDocument [19]: Title: Borderline ovarian cyst treated by laparoscopic surgery: clinical case report and literature review. Abstract: Borderline ovarian serous tumors are a rare distinct category of epithelial ovarian tumors, distinguished from both benign and invasive ovarian tumors. As borderline ovarian cysts are only a small part of the gynecological conditions of children, the therapeutic approach to this special type of tumor has not been standardized yet. Despite the technological breakthroughs that we have witnessed lately, the positive diagnosis of ovarian tumors is possible only by surgery and histopathological examination, and laparoscopic surgery has become the golden standard in the management of this condition. The aim of this case report is to demonstrate a very good long-term evolution after minimal invasive treatment and minimal damage to the reproductive apparatus in children with borderline ovarian tumors. The case reported in this paper is that of a 17-year-old adolescent with borderline serous papilliferous cystadenoma diagnosed by ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scanning, whose CA-125 biomarker had normal values. As the purpose was to preserve the patient's reproductive function, we chose to remove and excise the cyst by laparoscopic surgery, without removing the ovaries. The patient's subsequent evolution was positive and at 19-year-old, she gave natural birth to a healthy baby girl. Nevertheless, as relapses are possible after many years, the patient's long-term monitoring is necessary.\nDocument [20]: Title: Impact of Cystectomy on Ovarian Reserve: Review of the Literature. Abstract: Ovarian cysts are common in the reproductive age. Pathologic cysts such as endometriomas and dermoids often require surgical intervention if symptomatic. Laparoscopic cystectomy is the first-line treatment for these cysts and is associated with better pain control and less recurrence than drainage or cyst ablation procedures. There has been an emerging concern about the effect of ovarian cystectomy on ovarian reserve with some evidence of short-term and long-term reduction in ovarian reserve. Certain cyst characteristics (endometrioma pathology, large cyst size, bilateral presentation) are associated with a greater decline in ovarian reserve after cystectomy. The impact of surgery on ovarian reserve can be minimized by selecting the appropriate surgery for the patient, careful tissue handling, and limited use of electrosurgery. Patients should be counseled on the risks of surgery on reproductive potential, and the management plan should be individualized to the patient's symptoms and reproductive goals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Editor's Capsule Summary for Ferre et al(1) WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Patients with ureteral calculi are often prescribed adjunctive treatment with an alpha-blocking agent to enhance spontaneous stone passage. This practice has not been validated in emergency department (ED) patients. WHAT QUESTION THIS STUDY ADDRESSED: Does the addition of a 10-day course of tamsulosin to standard therapy after discharge from the ED increase the rate of passage of distal ureteral stones? WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE: In this randomized trial of 80 patients, most of whom had stones of 4 mm or less, time to stone passage was similar in tamsulosin and control patients. HOW THIS MIGHT CHANGE CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study does not support the routine use of tamsulosin in ED patients, though it is possible that it would be beneficial in patients with larger stones.\nDocument [2]: Title: Association between tamsulosin and intraoperative \"floppy-iris\" syndrome. Abstract: Intraoperative \"floppy-iris\" syndrome is a novel entity that was initially described in 2005 by Chang and Campbell who encountered it during cataract surgery. The manifestations include a triad of the following intraoperative findings: (a) flaccid iris stroma leading to fluttering and bellowing of the iris, (b) prolapse of the iris through the surgical incisions, and (c) progressive pupil constriction. IFIS has been associated with increased surgical difficulty and, as a result, with increased morbidity including retinal detachment and loss of vision. Since the initial publication of IFIS in 2005, there have been several reports of a possible association between the use of tamsulosin for symptomatic prostate hyperplasia and IFIS. Consequently, in 2005 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert recommending ophthalmic examination prior to treatment with tamsulosin. In this review we present evidence of the association between tamsulosin and IFIS. We conducted a Medline search using the key words tamsulosin or alpha-blockers and retrieved English written reports and data on the prevalence of treatment with alpha-blockers in general and specifically tamsulosin among patients undergoing cataract surgery, the prevalence of IFIS among treated versus non-treated patients, and the resulting surgical complications. Of the 19 publications on this topic only 7 were patient series providing data on IFIS and treatment with tamsulosin. The prevalence of men receiving tamsulosin for BPH among the patients operated for cataract was 1-3%, the occurrence of IFIS was reported in 2-3% of the patients, and 57-100% of the patients receiving tamsulosin had at least one manifestation of IFIS. The occurrence of IFIS among men receiving other alpha-blockers or in non-treated patients was rare. An association between preoperative treatment with tamsulosin and IFIS is probable. This observation warrants further research to establish causality. Meanwhile, it seems prudent to perform an ophthalmic examination prior to prescribing tamsulosin.\nDocument [3]: Title: [Combined treatment of BPS with tamsulosin and finasteride : Literature review and prescription data]. Abstract: Combined therapy of benign prostatic syndrome (BPS) with &#945;<sub>1</sub>-blockers and 5&#945;-reductase (5AR)-inhibitors is recommended according to two leading studies on doxazosin/finasteride and tamsulosin/dutasteride for all 10 in Germany possible combinations (five &#945;<sub>1</sub>-blockers and two 5AR inhibitors). Because tamsulosin and finasteride predominate in the treatment of BPS in Germany, the role of the combination tamsulosin/finasteride and its scientific basis from clinical studies has been investigated. A&#160;pharmacoepidemiological extrapolation from receipts of pharmacy data centres showed a&#160;strong increase of the combination tamsulosin/finasteride since 2003. As a&#160;free combination, tamsulosin/finasteride beside the fixed combination tamsulosin/dutasteride accounts to about 50% of all &#945;<sub>1</sub>-blocker/5AR-inhibitor combinations today. Clinical studies on tamsulosin/finasteride have been published including controlled studies of the combination and both monotherapies. The results of improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), maximum urinary flow rate (Q<sub>max</sub>), prostate volume (PV) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as well as adverse events and drug safety are in agreement with the leading studies. However, results due to chance cannot be excluded because of deficiencies in study design. A&#160;reliable comparison of the risk of progression between tamsulosin/finasteride and both monotherapies is lacking completely. Because of the great coherence and continuous evaluation of available data of all combinations, and with the established strong class effect of monotherapies, a&#160;continuation of the therapeutic practice with the combination tamsulosin/finasteride is possible.\nDocument [4]: Title: Association between <i>PRO 160/120</i> prescriptions and incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia complications in Germany: a retrospective cohort study. Abstract: The present study aims to analyze the impact of <i>PRO 160/120</i> prescriptions on the incidence of urinary incontinence, polyuria (including nocturia), urinary retention, and erectile dysfunction in a real-world setting in Germany and to compare these data with data for the 5-ARIs finasteride and dutasteride, and the &#945;1-adrenoceptor antagonists tamsulosin and tamsulosin/dutasteride fixed-dose combination. This retrospective study was based on the IQVIA Disease Analyzer database and included male patients with an initial prescription of <i>PRO 160/120</i>, finasteride, dutasteride, tamsulosin, or tamsulosin/dutasteride fixed-dose combination between January 2010 and September 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, health insurance, specialty, and relevant co-diagnoses were performed to estimate the association between <i>PRO 160/120</i> prescriptions and incidence of pre-defined outcomes. A total of 77,923 patients were included in the study, 3,035 of whom received <i>PRO 160/120. PRO 160/120</i> was significantly associated with reduced incidence of urinary incontinence (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.10-1.98) and urinary retention compared to tamsulosin (OR: 3.39; 95% CI: 1.75-6.57 and tamsulosin/dutasteride (OR: 2.81; 95% CI: 1.35-5.82). Furthermore, <i>PRO 160/120</i> significantly reduced the incidence of erectile dysfunction compared to dutasteride (OR: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.49-5.25). At the same time, patients receiving <i>PRO 160/120</i> showed the same incidence of the remaining complications as those taking the reference substances. In conclusion, we observed a significant association between <i>PRO 160/120</i> prescription and reduced incidence of urinary incontinence and urinary retention compared to tamsulosin and tamsulosin/dutasteride, as well as reduced incidence of erectile dysfunction compared to dutasteride.\nDocument [5]: Title: How to Read a Research Paper: An Exercise in Critical Thinking in the Context of an Epidemiologic Study on Tamsulosin and the Risk of Dementia. Abstract: A recent study of the relationship between tamsulosin and dementia found that, in propensity score-matched analyses that adjusted for measured risk factors for dementia, the use of tamsulosin to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of incident dementia relative to untreated BPH, BPH treated with the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors dutasteride and finasteride, and BPH treated with the \u03b1 adrenoceptor blockers doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin. The choice of control groups addressed confounding by indication, confounding by disease severity, and confounding by pharmacologic drug class. The authors of the study provided a wealth of detail in their main paper and in supplementary materials, allowing an almost forensic examination of the findings. This article discusses the study from the perspective of whether the hypothesis relating tamsulosin to dementia was set a priori or emerged after an exploratory exercise; whether tamsulosin crosses the blood-brain barrier for dementia as the event of interest to be attributable to treatment; whether the action of tamsulosin is plausibly related to dementia as a possible outcome; whether confounding was adequately addressed in the analyses; whether the duration of follow-up was sufficient for the event of interest to be attributable to tamsulosin; whether the absolute increase in the rate of incident dementia was clinically significant; and what the curiosities in the dose-dependence and subgroup analysis findings could imply. These matters provide considerable food for thought. Thus, this article is intended to serve as an example of how to read a paper critically and how to think about what the findings might suggest.\nDocument [6]: Title: Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Use of tamsulosin in patients with urinary calculi to increase spontaneous stone passage. Abstract: A short cut review was carried out to establish whether tamsulosin enhances the chances of spontaneous stone expulsion in renal colic. Thirty-five papers were found using the reported searches, of which two (a meta-analysis and one further randomised controlled trial) presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are presented in table 3. It is concluded tamsulosin may be useful during periods of watchful waiting to enhance ureteric stone expulsion.\nDocument [7]: Title: Multicenter drug use evaluation of tamsulosin and availability of guidance criteria for nonformulary use in the veterans affairs health system. Abstract: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Healthcare Group (PBM-SHG) and its Medical Advisory Panel developed national criteria (guidelines) for the appropriate use of tamsulosin in the VA. Drug use evaluation (DUE) was performed to (a) determine the prescribing patterns (indications and patient follow-up monitoring as measured by a clinician.s note regarding evaluation of therapeutic response or report of adverse drug event) of tamsulosin, (b) assess the impact of the availability (not active dissemination) of national criteria for nonformulary use of tamsulosin, and (c) project the cost avoidance if generic terazosin was substituted for tamsulosin in those patients who were prescribed tamsulosin outside of appropriate use criteria.\nDocument [8]: Title: A randomized crossover study comparing patient preference for tamsulosin and silodosin in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Abstract: Patient preference for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment with the \u03b1(1)-blockers, tamsulosin or silodosin, was compared using patient-reported outcomes. Japanese patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH were randomly allocated to either the T-S group (tamsulosin 0.2 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks then silodosin 4 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks) or the S-T group (silodosin 4 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks then tamsulosin 0.2 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks). The primary endpoint was the preferred drug for treatment continuation at 8 weeks, determined by a patient-reported questionnaire. In total, 102 patients (mean age 70.3 years) were enrolled and 84 (n = 42 per group) completed the study. A significant difference was observed between the proportion of patients who preferred tamsulosin (59/84 patients; 70.2%) and those who preferred silodosin (18/84 patients; 21.4%). A major reason for preference of either drug was 'good efficacy'. Incidence of adverse effects was significantly lower with tamsulosin (3/91 patients; 3.3%) than with silodosin (25/88 patients; 28.4%). These findings indicate that tamsulosin is very effective for BPH, has few adverse effects and that patients want to continue to use it.\nDocument [9]: Title: Tamsulosin facilitates depressive-like behaviors in mice: Involvement of endogenous glucocorticoids. Abstract: The benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the main source of lower urinary tract symptoms. The BPH is a common age-dependent disease and tamsulosin is an &#945;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor blocker widely prescribed for BPH. Beyond the common adverse effects of tamsulosin, increased diagnosis of dementia after prescription was observed. Importantly, a clinical study suggested that tamsulosin may exert antidepressant effects in BPH patients. Considering the expression of &#945;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors in the brain, this study aimed to investigate the effects of tamsulosin in the forced swimming and open field tests in mice. For this, tamsulosin (0.001-1&#160;mg/kg) was orally administered subacutely (1, 5 and 23&#160;hr) and acutely (60&#160;min) before tests. Mifepristone (10&#160;mg/kg), a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, and aminoglutethimide (10&#160;mg/kg), a streoidogenesis inhibitor, were intraperitoneally injected before tamsulosin to investigate the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the mediation of tamsulosin-induced effects. Subacute and acute administrations of tamsulosin increased the immobility time in the first exposition to an inescapable stressful situation. In the re-exposition to the swim task, controls displayed a natural increase in the immobility time, and the treatment with tamsulosin further increased this behavioral parameter. Tamsuslosin did not affect spontaneous locomotion neither in na&#239;ve nor in stressed mice. Our findings also showed that mifepristone and aminoglutethimide prevented the tamsulosin-induced increase in the immobility time in the first and second swimming sessions, respectively. In conclusion, tamsulosin may contribute to increased susceptibility to depressive-like behaviors, by facilitating the acquisition of a passive stress-copying strategy. These effects seem to be dependent on endogenous glucocorticoids.\nDocument [10]: Title: Impact of four loci on serum tamsulosin hydrochloride concentration. Abstract: Tamsulosin hydrochloride is one of the most potent drugs for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), however, the efficacy of tamsulosin hydrochloride varies among individuals. In this study, we measured the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of tamsulosin hydrochloride in 182 of BPH patients and found remarkable individual variability. To investigate the genetic factors that regulate pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride, we conducted a genome-wide association study in these 182 BPH patients. As a result, rs16902947 on chromosome 5p13.2, rs7779057 on 7q22.3, rs35681285 on 7p21.2 and rs2122469 on 8p21.3 indicated possible associations with Cmax of tamsulosin hydrochloride (P=1.29 \u00d7 10(-7), 2.15 \u00d7 10(-7), 4.35 \u00d7 10(-7) and 7.03 \u00d7 10(-7), respectively), although these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) did not reach the genome-wide significance threshold after Bonferroni correction. As these associated SNPs showed additive effects on serum tamsulosin hydrochloride concentration, we defined the 'Cmax prediction index' based on genotypes of these SNPs. This index clearly associated with Cmax values (P=4.5 \u00d7 10(-6)), indicating the possible roles of these four variants in tamsulosin hydrochloride pharmacokinetics. Our findings would partially explain the variability of the response to the tamsulosin hydrochloride treatment.\nDocument [11]: Title: The impact of tamsulosin on cognition in Alzheimer disease with benign prostate hyperplasia: A study using the Hallym Smart Clinical Data Warehouse. Abstract: Studies suggest that the use of alpha-blockers increases the risk of dementia in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Due to study limitations, the relationship between the use of alpha-blockers, such as tamsulosin, and the risk of dementia is still unclear. However, alpha1-adrenoreceptors are also present in the brain, so there is potential for adverse effects on cognitive function. Therefore, we investigated possible associations between the use of alpha-blockers and aggravation of cognitive decline in dementia patients using a clinical data analytic solution called the Smart Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW).We retrospectively investigated clinical data using the Smart CDW of Hallym University Medical Center from 2009 to 2019. We enrolled patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) who had completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at least twice during follow-up, and who had BPH. We compared the difference in MMSE scores between patients who took tamsulosin for >1000 days and those who did not take any alpha-blocker. We tested the effect of tamsulosin on cognitive decline in patients with AD, using propensity score-matched logistic regression analysis.Eligible cases were included in the tamsulosin (n = 68) or no-medication (n = 153) groups. After propensity score matching, clinical characteristics such as educational attainment and vascular risk factors were similar in the tamsulosin and no-medication groups. The MMSE scores did not differ significantly between the tamsulosin and no-medication groups (P = .470).The results suggest that tamsulosin for BPH is not associated with worsening of the cognitive decline in patients with AD.\nDocument [12]: Title: Tamsulosin and cataract surgery: hypotonic iris. Abstract: (1) Hypotonic or floppy iris syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in patients taking tamsulosin, an alpha blocker indicated for benign prostatic hypertrophy. Hypotonic iris makes surgery more difficult and increases the risk of complications, especially those linked to the use of mechanical retractors. (2) Several studies including hundreds of patients have confirmed the role of tamsulosin in this syndrome. It is not clear how long before surgery tamsulosin should be withdrawn: cases have been reported from 2 days to 9 months after tamsulosin withdrawal. (3) It is not known whether other alpha blockers have the same effect. (4) In practice, as tamsulosin does not have a better risk-benefit balance than other alpha blockers, it should be avoided in men who have not had cataract surgery.\nDocument [13]: Title: Tamsulosin for urolithiasis: a review of the recent literature and current controversies. Abstract: In the United States, urolithiasis affects approximately 1 in 11 people, and there is evidence that the prevalence is increasing. A relatively recent treatment strategy for urolithiasis involves using medical expulsive therapy (MET) to increase the likelihood of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones. The 2 leading drug classes for MET are alpha-1-andrenergic receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers. Tamsulosin, an alpha-1-adrenocepter blocking agent, is thought to induce spontaneous stone passage by relaxing ureteral smooth muscle tone. However, tamsulosin has not been proven effective for increasing ureteral stone passage and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication. There is a relative paucity of data on the efficacy of tamsulosin for urolithiasis, and of the published results, there are conflicting conclusions from the data. Because of the acute and often severe nature of symptoms from urolithiasis, emergency medicine physicians are frequently the first to diagnose and treat this condition. This has led to tamsulosin being frequently prescribed from the emergency department (ED) for off-label use without the support of high-quality evidence. If tamsulosin is proven effective, its use in the treatment of urolithiasis could offer several important advantages. The number of procedures, length of hospital stay, and health care costs after the initial ED visit could potentially be reduced. Tamsulosin may also increase patient satisfaction by reducing the invasive treatment and decreasing the time to stone passage. This review focuses on the efficacy of tamsulosin based on stone location, after shock wave lithotripsy, compared with other MET drugs and in the acute setting of the ED.\nDocument [14]: Title: Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Induced by Tamsulosin: The Risk and Preventive Strategies. Abstract: Tamsulosin is an antagonist of a subtype-specific alpha-1A- and alpha-1D-adrenoceptor (AR) that is expressed in the prostate gland, urethra, and bladder. Several reports have shown a possible relationship between ophthalmologic adverse effects and the use of alpha-1-receptor medicines, including tamsulosin. This descriptive review evaluates the intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) associated with tamsulosin. A search of the Medline and PubMed databases was conducted to identify control trials, case reports, and observational examinations published in English. The publication dates were restricted (January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2020). Keywords (tamsulosin, alpha-blocker, ocular, eye, adverse reaction, and IFIS) were used in the searches. The searches identified 66 studies including <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i> studies, trials, and observational studies. Twenty-two (33.33%) studies were articles citing tamsulosin and IFIS as having confirmed potential risk to ocular safety. The results of this review, including a comprehensive summary of published research on tamsulosin use in different populations, have identified several articles showing associations between tamsulosin and IFIS that merit further investigation. Suspending of potential causative pharmacological treatment of IFIS before ocular surgery including tamsulosin, proper identification of at-risk patients, preoperative prophylaxis treatments, and surgical technique modifications clearly can mitigate the anticipated risk of IFIS induced by tamsulosin.\nDocument [15]: Title: Tamsulosin attenuates high glucose- induced injury in glomerular endothelial cells. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes. Tamsulosin is a selective \u03b11-AR antagonist. \u03b11-AR is expressed widely in kidney tissues and has displayed its various physiological functions. However, whether Tamsulosin has affects DN is unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first time it has been examined whether Tamsulosin possesses a beneficial effect in high glucose-challenged glomerular endothelial cells (GECs). Firstly, we found that Tamsulosin reduced high glucose-induced expressions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8. Secondly, Tamsulosin alleviated high glucose-induced expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Thirdly, Tamsulosin inhibited the expressions of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Importantly, our results indicate that Tamsulosin inhibited high glucose-induced expressions of fibrosis factors such as Col-1 and TGF-\u03b21. Additionally, we found that Tamsulosin ameliorated oxidative stress via reducing the generation of ROS and preventing the activation of p38. Mechanistically, we found that Tamsulosin attenuated high glucose-induced activation of NF-\u03baB. Based on these findings, we conclude that Tamsulosin could attenuate high glucose-induced injury in GECs through alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory response.\nDocument [16]: Title: Tamsulosin and risk of priapism: A causality assessment using Austin Bradford Hill Criteria. Abstract: Tamsulosin hydrochloride, a selective alpha-adrenergic blocking agent has been previously associated with priapism. Priapism is a medically serious condition that, if not intervened, can cause permanent erectile dysfunction. This study was conducted to investigate whether the association of tamsulosin and priapism is causal. All currently available evidence such as experimental, biological, toxicological, published studies, and safety data mined from the WHO global pharmacovigilance database was systematically organized into the Austin Bradford Hill causality assessment framework. In the international pharmacovigilance database, a strong association between tamsulosin and priapism (IC<sub>025</sub> &#160;=&#160;4.1; PRR<sub>025</sub> &#160;=&#160;19.9; ROR<sub>025</sub> &#160;=&#160;20) was observed. There were 122 cases of priapism associated with tamsulosin submitted to the database from 23 countries. In 87.7% of the cases, tamsulosin was reported as a 'sole suspect,' and in 50.8%, it was the only drug administered. In several patients, priapism resolved following discontinuation of tamsulosin and recurred after its reintroduction. Both in the published and unpublished data, for majority of the cases, the time to onset of priapism was within few days following the first intake of tamsulosin. Cases of priapism, particularly those published, were consistent in their clinical features with patients experiencing prolonged painful erection that required aspiration of cavernosal blood, irrigation of the corpora cavernosa, and treatment with vasopressors. Other alpha-adrenergic blocking agents that are structurally analogous with tamsulosin have also been associated with priapism. In several cases, tamsulosin was used off-label, for the treatment of ureteral calculi expulsion. Eight patients experienced priapism that ended up with serious complications such as ejaculation disorders and erectile dysfunction. The currently available totality of evidence suggests that the association of tamsulosin and priapism is causal. Healthcare professionals are therefore recommended to cautiously prescribe tamsulosin and ensure that consumers are aware of the potential risk of priapism.\nDocument [17]: Title: Prescription pattern of alpha-blockers for management of lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia. Abstract: This study investigated trends in the prescription of \u03b1-blockers for patients with BPH, focusing on changing patterns of prescriptions during 2002-2013 using National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data. A total of 65,596 Korean males over 50 years old diagnosed with BPH were identified from the NHIS-NSC database between 2002-2013. Patterns of each \u03b1 -blocker prescription were analyzed and persistence rate, switch rate, and return rate during a follow-up period of 3 years after the first prescription were calculated. A total of 28,318 men over 50 years old (64.95 \u00b1 9.12), changed medication within six months following the first prescription of \u03b1 -blocker. (1) Tamsulosin showed the highest persistence rate when compared with other \u03b1-blockers (2) Among patients who switched to a second \u03b1-blocker, tamsulosin showed the highest return rate when compared with other \u03b1-blockers. Tamsulosin has been the most commonly prescribed \u03b11-blocker since the mid-2000s, in line with its demonstrated highest persistence and return rates. These data probably reflect patient satisfaction with \u03b11-blockers in the management of BPH, in which the decision to stop and switch pharmacological treatments is primarily based on changes in symptoms or side effects.\nDocument [18]: Title: Characteristics of men with untreated LUTS interested in over-the-counter tamsulosin. Abstract: Treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is often delayed, as it is considered a natural progression of aging. We described baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of men currently not using prescription medications for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but interested in self-directed use of over-the-counter (OTC) tamsulosin and who had participated in OTC tamsulosin-simulated studies.\nDocument [19]: Title: Dutasteride/tamsulosin: in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Abstract: The 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor dutasteride and the \u03b1(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist tamsulosin are available as a fixed-dose combination for use in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an enlarged prostate. Dutasteride 0.5 mg/day plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day improved lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) to a significantly greater extent than dutasteride or tamsulosin alone in men with BPH, moderate to severe LUTS and an increased risk of disease progression, according to the results of the randomized, double-blind, multinational CombAT trial. The mean change from baseline in the total International Prostate Symptom Score was significantly greater with dutasteride plus tamsulosin than with dutasteride or tamsulosin alone after 2 years (primary endpoint) and 4 years of therapy. After 4 years' therapy in the CombAT trial, the time to first acute urinary retention or BPH-related surgery (primary endpoint) significantly favoured men with symptomatic BPH who were receiving dutasteride plus tamsulosin versus those receiving tamsulosin alone, with no significant difference between recipients of dutasteride plus tamsulosin and recipients of dutasteride alone. In the CombAT trial, health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction were improved to a significantly greater extent with dutasteride plus tamsulosin than with dutasteride or tamsulosin alone. Combination therapy with oral dutasteride plus tamsulosin was generally well tolerated in patients with symptomatic BPH in the CombAT trial.\nDocument [20]: Title: Efficacy and safety of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for the treatment of distal ureteral calculi of 5 to 10 mm in size: A systematic review and network meta-analysis. Abstract: To evaluate the Efficacy and safety of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors as a medical therapy for distal ureteral calculi by means of a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). We searched the Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published before May, 2017. Stone passage rate as the primary outcome. We used random effects model for pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian random effects model for NMA. We evaluated the quality of evidence by the GRADE framework for each network estimate. Five RCTs (861 patients) comparing four different interventions. The results of NMA showed that compared with tamsulosin alone, tamsulosin combined with tadalafil group was associated with significantly higher stone passage rate (odds radio [OR] 2.55, 95% credible intervals [Crl] 1.11 to 5.89). When considering stone expulsion rate, compared with tamsulosin, silodosin was ranked best (OR 3.58, 95% Crl 1.13 to 11.91), followed by tamsulosin combined with tadalafil (OR 2.55, 95% Crl 1.11 to 5.89) and tadalafil alone (OR 1.86, 95% Crl 0.95 to 4.25). No significant difference was found considering safety profiles between any interventions. This meta-analysis indicates that tamsulosin combined with tadalafil is an effective treatment option for ureteral stones with a low occurrence of side effects. Clinicians should take all known safety and compliance of patients into account when choosing an optimal strategy. Since sample size of included studies, further RCTs are strongly encouraged to address the clinical question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Serum levels of inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were measured at baseline in serum samples from 189 patients who were admitted for coronary angiography because of suspected ischemic heart disease. Median duration of follow-up was 28 months. Patients in our sample were enrolled in 4 diagnostic groups: no hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and no coronary vasospasm (control group, n = 32), hemodynamically significant CAD and stable angina pectoris (SAP group, n = 34), coronary vasospastic angina pectoris without hemodynamically significant CAD (vasospasm group, n = 31), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and hemodynamically significant CAD (ACS group, n = 92). Overall, the level of serum inflammatory markers was highest in the ACS group and lowest in the control group, with intermediate values observed in the SAP and vasospasm groups, with the exception of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, the level of which was highest in the vasospasm group. Multivariate analysis showed that log (interleukin-6) was independently associated with a diagnosis of coronary vasospastic angina pectoris in patients without hemodynamically significant CAD (odds ratio 8.48, p = 0.027). Patients in the ACS group had a significantly lower survival rate compared with the other 3 groups but without an independent predictor that could be identified in this patient cohort. Recurrent angina pectoris occurred with similar rates in the SAP, vasospasm, and ACS groups. The independent predictor for recurrent angina pectoris was treatment that did not include clopidogrel (odds ratio 3.88, p = 0.007). In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that inflammation can exist in coronary vasospasm without hemodynamically significant CAD.\nDocument [2]: Title: Symptoms and angiographic findings of patients undergoing elective coronary angiography without prior stress testing. Abstract: Many patients undergo elective coronary angiography without preprocedural stress testing that may be suitable if performed in patients with more angina pectoris or more frequently identified obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry undergoing elective coronary angiography from July 2009 to April 2013 were assessed for differences in angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS] class) and severity of obstructive CAD in those with and without preprocedural stress testing, stratified by CAD history. Given the large sample size, differences were considered clinically meaningful if the standardized difference (SD) was >10%. Of 790,601 patients without CAD history, 36.9% did not undergo preprocedural stress testing. Compared with patients with preprocedural stress testing, patients without preprocedural stress testing were more frequently angina free (CCS class 0; 28.2% with stress test vs 38.5% without, SD = 14.8%) and had similar rates of obstructive CAD (40.1% with stress test vs 35.7% without, SD = 9.0). Of 449,579 patients with CAD history, 44.2% did not undergo preprocedural stress testing. Patients without preprocedural stress testing reported more angina (CCS class III/IV angina: 17.8% vs 13.4%; SD = 11.3%) but were not more likely to have obstructive CAD (78.7% vs 81.1%; SD = 5.8%) than patients with preprocedural stress testing. In conclusion, approximately 40% of patients undergoing elective coronary angiography did not have preprocedural risk stratification with stress testing. For these patients, the clinical decision to proceed directly to invasive evaluation was not driven primarily by severe angina and did not result in higher detection rates for obstructive CAD.\nDocument [3]: Title: Aldosterone blockade over and above ACE-inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease but without heart failure. Abstract: Recent evidence points to a role for the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its complications, including acute angina pectoris. Two large trials in heart failure have clearly demonstrated that blocking aldosterone improves mortality and that this benefit occurs over and above standard therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The question that naturally arises from these landmark studies is whether aldosterone blockade would produce the same benefits in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) but no heart failure. There are three reasons to believe this might be the case. Firstly, angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone produce similar biological effects and Ang II withdrawal has been shown to benefit patients with angina; aldosterone blockade may therefore follow in the footsteps of ACE inhibitors, as it did in heart failure, and produce benefits in vascular patients without heart failure. Secondly, one of the main mechanisms which is thought to be responsible for the benefit of aldosterone blockade in the Randomised ALdactone Evaluation Study (RALES) and Eplerenone Post-AMI Heart Failure Survival Study (EPHESUS), is that it improves endothelial/vascular function and endothelial/vascular dysfunction is the fundamental abnormality in angina pectoris. Finally, aldosterone blockade has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in animal studies of atherosclerosis without heart failure, which are analogous to CAD patients.\nDocument [4]: Title: Prevalence of stable coronary artery disease and its associated clinical factors among patients with chest pain and elevated cardiac troponin alone. Abstract: Cardiac troponin is a useful test for diagnosing cardiogenic causes in patients with chest pain. However, cardiac troponin levels are often elevated in patients with chest pain due to non-cardiac causes other than coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and its associated factors in patients with chest pain and elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI). 104 patients (mean age, 65 \u00b1 11 years; 60 [58%] men) who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) for chest pain and elevated cTnI levels were enrolled in this study. All patients had a normal CK-MB range and did not show any ischemic changes on electrocardiography or echocardiography. Patients were classified into two groups according to the presence of CAD (Group 1, n = 62) and the absence of CAD (Group 2, n = 42). Patients were classified into subgroups according to the presence (Group 2a, microvascular angina [MVA], n = 18) and absence (Group 2b, non-angina [NA], n = 25) of angina. CAD was diagnosed in 62 (60%) patients and MVA was suspected in 18 (17%) patients without CAD. Patients with CAD showed elevated blood pressure and slightly decreased heart rate. Diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in patients with CAD and patients without CAD (esp. with MVA) were more likely to be common drinkers. Increased relative wall thickness (RWT) and reduced E' velocity were associated with CAD. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were reduced in patients with CAD and MVA but were higher in patients with NA. Lower HDL level was found to be independently associated with the presence of CAD. Elevated cTn1 levels without other evidence of myocardial ischemia are sufficient for performing CAG in patients with stable chest pain.\nDocument [5]: Title: Influence of symptom typicality for predicting MACE in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease: From the CONFIRM Registry (Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter Registry). Abstract: Our objective was to assess the prognostic value of symptom typicality in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), determined by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA). We identified 4215 patients without prior history of CAD and without obstructive CAD (<50% CCTA stenosis). CAD severity was categorized as nonobstructive (1%-49%) and none (0%). Based upon the Diamond-Forrester criteria for angina pectoris, symptom typicality was classified as asymptomatic, nonanginal, atypical, and typical. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), comprising all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and late revascularization, according to symptom typicality. Mean patient age was 57.0 \u00b112.0 years (54.9% male). During a median follow-up of 5.3 years (interquartile range, 4.6-5.9 years), MACE were reported in 312 (7.4%) patients. Among patients with nonobstructive CAD, there was an association between symptom typicality and MACE (P for interaction = 0.05), driven by increased risk of MACE among those with typical angina and nonobstructive CAD (hazard ratio: 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.48, P = 0.03). No consistent relationship was found between symptom typicality and MACE among patients without any CAD (hazard ratio: 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-1.57, P = 0.08). In the CONFIRM registry, patients who presented with concomitant typical angina and nonobstructive CAD had a higher rate of MACE than did asymptomatic patients with nonobstructive CAD. However, the presence of typical angina did not appear to portend worse prognosis in patients with no CAD.\nDocument [6]: Title: Influence of coronary computed tomographic angiography on patient treatment and prognosis in patients with suspected stable angina pectoris. Abstract: We evaluated the influence of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) as a first-line diagnostic test on patient treatment and prognosis. A total of 1,055 consecutive patients with suspected stable angina pectoris (mean age 55 \u00b1 10 years, 56% women) and a low to intermediate pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) were included in the present study. The patients were followed for a median of 18 months. The use of downstream diagnostic testing and medical therapy after CTA were recorded. The CTA result was normal in 49%, and nonobstructive and obstructive CAD (\u226550% stenosis) was demonstrated in 31% and 15% of the patients, respectively. Coronary CTA was inconclusive in 5% of the patients. The use of antiplatelet therapy decreased with normal findings from CTA, and the use of antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents increased in patients with CAD. Additional testing was performed in 2% of patients with normal CTA findings and in 7% and 82% of patients with nonobstructive or obstructive CAD, respectively. No patients without CAD, 0.9% of patients with nonobstructive CAD, and 1.9% of patients with obstructive CAD met the primary end point (cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction, p = 0.008). No patients without CAD, 1.5% of patients with nonobstructive CAD, and 30% patients with obstructive CAD met the secondary end point (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization, p <0.0001). In conclusion, in patients suspected of having angina, the findings from CTA influence patient treatment without resulting in excessive additional testing. Coronary CTA provides important prognostic information, with excellent intermediate-term outcomes in patients with normal CTA findings.\nDocument [7]: Title: Comparison of clinical characteristics and prognosis in Taiwanese patients with coronary vasospastic angina pectoris without significant fixed coronary artery disease versus patients with significant fixed coronary artery disease and either stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndromes. Abstract: Limited information is available comparing the clinical characteristics and prognosis for patients with coronary vasospastic angina in the absence of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) (defined as >50% stenosis) versus patients with significant fixed CAD presenting with either stable angina pectoris (SAP) or acute coronary syndromes (ACS).\nDocument [8]: Title: Relation of cardiovascular risk factors and angina status to obstructive coronary artery disease according to categorical coronary artery calcium score. Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is associated with the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiovascular risk factors. However, the relation between cardiovascular risk factors and CAD has not yet been fully elucidated in patients with a zero or low coronary artery calcium score (CACS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation of cardiovascular risk factors and angina status to obstructive CAD according to categorical CACS. A total of 753 patients were enrolled in this study. CAC scoring and coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) were performed with dual-source 64-slice CT scanners. The number of patients with a CACS \u226410 and \u2264100 were 358 and 528, respectively. Patients with a higher CACS were older and more frequently male, and had a greater frequency of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence of obstructive CAD increased with the CACS. Among patients with a CACS \u2264100, age, male gender, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and typical angina pectoris were related to obstructive CAD. The presence of hypercholesterolemia was relatively strongly associated with obstructive CAD (OR 6.67, 95% CI 2.91-15.3, p < 0.001) on multivariate analysis. Among patients with a CACS \u226410, men, hypercholesterolemia, and typical angina pectoris were significantly more frequent in patients with than in those without obstructive CAD (p < 0.01). Our data suggest that neither the absence nor low of coronary calcium burden may reliably exclude obstructive CAD in typical symptomatic male patients with hypercholesterolemia. This result may be useful to interpret the relation of CACS to obstructive CAD.\nDocument [9]: Title: Characteristics, treatment and quality of life of stable coronary artery disease patients with or without angina: Insights from the START study. Abstract: Data on contemporary management patterns of angina in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are scarce. We sought to describe the current presentation, management, and quality of life of stable CAD patients with or without angina, using the data from the START (STable Coronary Artery Diseases RegisTry) study. START was a prospective, observational, nationwide study aimed to evaluate the presentation, management, treatment and quality of life of stable CAD presenting to cardiologists during outpatient visits or discharged from cardiology wards. Among the 5070 consecutive stable CAD patients enrolled in 183 participating centers over a 3-month period, 3714 (73.2%) had no angina and 1356 (26.8%) presented with angina. Patients with angina underwent more frequently coronary angiography (92.7% vs 84.9%; p<0.0001) and other diagnostic imaging procedures compared to those without angina. In addition, patients with angina received more frequently different combinations of first line therapies and angina relief drugs compared to patients without angina. The quality of life, assessed with the EQ 5D-5L questionnaire, did not differ between the two groups, with the exception of the 'pain or worry' domain that was higher in patients with compared to those without angina (p<0.0001). Current management and treatment of stable CAD patients with angina is still suboptimal and different compared to those without angina. Our findings highlight the need for disseminating best-practice patterns and improving guidelines adherence for the management of angina even among cardiologists.\nDocument [10]: Title: Predictors of coronary artery disease in patients with left bundle branch block undergoing coronary angiography. Abstract: Patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) have a worse prognosis than those with LBBB without CAD. In addition, subjects with CAD and concomitant LBBB have a higher cardiovascular mortality than those with a similar extent of CAD but without LBBB. Because the presence of LBBB makes the noninvasive identification of CAD problematic, patients with LBBB often are referred for coronary angiography to assess the presence and severity of CAD. To determine the clinical and demographic variables that might help identify those with CAD, we analyzed data from 336 consecutive patients with LBBB referred for coronary angiography. Of the 336, 54% had CAD. In conclusion, those with CAD were likely to be older, Caucasian, and men; they were more likely to have angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and diabetes mellitus; and they were more likely to have a left ventricular ejection fraction <0.50. In contrast, patients with heart failure were less likely to have CAD.\nDocument [11]: Title: Association of Major Adverse Cardiac Events up to 5 Years in Patients With Chest Pain Without Significant Coronary Artery Disease in the Korean Population. Abstract: Background Significant coronary artery disease has a well-known association with long-term adverse cardiovascular events. In this study, we aimed to evaluate its association with long-term major adverse clinical events ( MACE ) up to 5 years in patients who presented with chest pain without significant coronary artery disease . Methods and Results A total of 5890 subjects with chest pain without significant coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled in this study. The mean follow-up duration was 3.4 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed for assessing the independent risk factors for MACE or sustained angina pectoris. MACE was defined as the composite of total death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, and hospitalization because of heart failure. Ninety-one (2.2%) patients developed MACE , and 309 (8.1%) patients developed sustained angina pectoris , both within 5 years. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of MACE was significantly associated with age (per 5 years; hazard ratio [ HR ], 1.44; 95% CI , 1.30-1.60) and insignificant coronary stenosis (30%-70%; HR, 2.03; 95% CI; 1.28-3.21). The risk of sustained angina pectoris was significantly associated with age (per 5 years; HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11), dyslipidemia ( HR, 1.34; 95% CI , 1.06-1.70), insignificant coronary stenosis ( HR, 2.54; 95% CI , 1.94-3.31), coronary artery spasm (HR, 1.42; 95% CI , 1.11-1.80), and myocardial bridge (HR, 1.37; 95% CI , 1.04-1.81). Conclusions In patients without significant CAD , aging and insignificant coronary stenosis have a strong association with future long-term MACE . Also, aging, dyslipidemia, insignificant coronary stenosis , coronary artery spasm, and myocardial bridge are strongly associated with future angina pectoris .\nDocument [12]: Title: Management of angina pectoris: the role of spinal cord stimulation. Abstract: Progress in prevention as well as drug and interventional therapy has improved the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disorders. Many patients at risk have advanced coronary artery disease (CAD), have had multiple coronary interventions, and present with significant co-morbidity. Despite adequate risk factor modulation and often several revascularization procedures, some of these patients still have refractory angina pectoris. Apart from advanced CAD and insufficient collateralization, the cause is often endothelial dysfunction. For this situation, one treatment option is neuromodulation. Controlled studies suggest that, in patients with chronic refractory angina pectoris, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) provides a relief from symptoms equivalent to that provided by surgical therapy, but with fewer complications and lower rehospitalization rates. SCS may result in significant long-term pain relief with improved quality of life. In patients with refractory angina undergoing SCS, some studies have shown not only a symptomatic improvement, but also a decrease in myocardial ischemia and an increase in coronary blood flow. Discussion is ongoing as to whether this is a direct effect on parasympathetic vascodilation or merely a secondary phenomenon resulting from increased physical activity following an improvement in clinical symptoms. Results from nuclear medical studies have sparked discussion about improved endothelial function and increased collateralization. SCS is a safe treatment option for patients with refractory angina pectoris, and its long-term effects are evident. It is a procedure without significant complications that is easy to tolerate. SCS does not interact with pacemakers, provided that strict bipolar right-ventricular sensing is used. Use in patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators is under discussion. Individual testing is mandatory in order to assess optimal safety in each patient.\nDocument [13]: Title: Cardio-cerebrovascular protective effects of valsartan in high-risk hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease (from the Kyoto Heart Study). Abstract: The objective was to examine whether previous coronary artery disease (CAD) influences the add-on effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan on cardio-cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk hypertensive patients who participated in the Kyoto Heart Study. The primary end point was the same as in the main study: a composite of new-onset and/or worsening of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Median follow-up was 3.27 years. According to the presence of previous CAD at baseline, the study population was divided into 2 groups (with CAD, n = 707; without CAD, n = 2,324) in which primary end-point events occurred more frequently in patients with CAD than in patients without CAD (15.1% vs 5.6%, hazard ratio [HR] 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.11 to 3.42). Add-on valsartan significantly decreased the occurrence of the primary end-point events in patients with CAD (11.3% vs 19.0%, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) and without CAD (3.7% vs 7.6%, HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70) compared to non-ARB treatment. In the presence of previous CAD, patients with valsartan add-on treatment had a significantly lower prevalence of angina pectoris and stroke than those with non-ARB treatment, whereas the valsartan add-on effects on angina and stroke were not significant in the absence of CAD. Changes in blood pressure during the follow-up period did not differ significantly between study subgroups. In conclusion, in the presence or absence of previous CAD, valsartan add-on treatment prevented more cardio-cerebrovascular events than conventional non-ARB treatment in high-risk hypertensive patients. In addition, valsartan add-on treatment conferred not only an antianginal effect but also stroke prevention exclusively in hypertensive patients with CAD compared to those without CAD.\nDocument [14]: Title: Smaller HDL particles are associated with absence of obstructive coronary artery disease in stable angina pectoris patients. Abstract: A research on novel cardiovascular risk factors is mainly focused on patients with clinically verified coronary artery disease (CAD), while less is known about their presence in symptomatic patients, but without angiographically proven occlusion of coronary arteries. The aim of this study was to compare plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) size and subclasses in stable angina patients with and without significant obstructive CAD.\nDocument [15]: Title: Coronary vasomotor response is related to the angiographic extent of coronary sclerosis in patients with stable angina pectoris. Abstract: Disturbed vasomotor function in coronary arteries has clinical importance in early stages of coronary artery disease (CAD), as it may contribute to the potential risk for an ischaemic coronary event. In the present study, we have investigated the relationship between coronary vasomotor function and the extent of CAD. The response to acetylcholine and nitrate infusion was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. The extent of CAD was categorized into two groups: minor CAD (normal coronary arteries and vessel wall irregularities) and significant CAD (one-, two- and three-vessel disease). A total of 277 patients with stable angina pectoris, referred for a first diagnostic coronary angiography, were eligible for analysis (mean age 57 years, 61% male). The response to nitrate was significantly impaired in patients with significant CAD ( P <0.001). On the other hand, the response to acetylcholine was not different between the two groups ( P =0.12); however, a trend between the response to acetylcholine and the extent of CAD was observed in patients without a previous infarction ( P =0.07), which was a significant interaction variable. Furthermore, a significant relationship between coronary vasomotor response and the number of cardiovascular risk factors was observed ( P <0.05). In conclusion, in a heterogeneous group of patients, coronary vasomotor function measured by nitrate infusion was more strongly associated with the extent of CAD and the number of risk factors than the response to acetylcholine. These data suggest that, in patients with advanced atherosclerosis or multiple risk factors, the vasomotor dysfunction is not solely restricted to the endothelium.\nDocument [16]: Title: Overlap between angina without obstructive coronary artery disease and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction. Abstract: A link between angina with no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction has been proposed, but evidence in support of this is lacking. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated whether left ventricular diastolic function in women with angina pectoris and no obstructive CAD differed from a reference population.\nDocument [17]: Title: Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention does not affect androgen status in males with chronic stable angina pectoris. Abstract: There is a clear association between low serum testosterone and coronary artery disease (CAD) in men. Hypotestosteronaemia is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and a quarter of men with CAD are biochemically hypogonadal. Amongst those with CAD, hypotestosteronaemia is associated with increased mortality. Testosterone vasodilates coronary arteries, and exogenous testosterone reduces ischaemia. Whether hypotestosteronaemia is a cause or a consequence of CAD remains unanswered. The aim of this prospective observational study was to investigate whether coronary revascularization affected androgen status in men with stable angina pectoris. Twenty five men (mean age 62.7, SD 9.18) with angiographically significant CAD and symptomatic angina underwent full coronary revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention. Androgen status and symptoms of angina, stress, depression and sexual function were assessed before, and at one and 6 months after the coronary revascularization. All patients underwent complete revascularization which was associated with a significant reduction in angina symptoms and ischaemia. No significant difference was seen in total testosterone (11.33 nmol/L baseline; 12.56, 1 month post; 13.04 at 6 months; p = 0.08). A significant and sustained rise in sex hormone-binding globulin was seen (33.99 nm/L baseline; 36.11 nm/L 1 month post PCI; 37.94 nm/L at 6 months; p = 0.03) Overall, there was no significant alteration in any other marker of androgen status including free testosterone or bioavailable testosterone. There was no change in symptoms of anxiety, depression or sexual function. Coronary revascularization has no sustained effect on androgen status. This supports the hypothesis that hypotestosteronaemia is not a consequence of angina pectoris or myocardial ischaemia.\nDocument [18]: Title: Relationship between increased serum resistin level and severity of coronary artery disease. Abstract: Resistin, which is derived from the gene of RSTN, belongs to a family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins called resistin-like molecules (RELMs). Increased serum resistin levels are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and the risk of cardiovascular death. Patients (n = 214) with an initial diagnosis of stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation and referred to catheter laboratory for coronary angiography were enrolled in the study. We aimed to investigate the relationship between increased serum resistin level and CAD. The severity of CAD was calculated by the Gensini scoring system. In conclusion, we established a significant correlation between serum resistin levels and CAD (P = .010). Also, serum resistin levels correlated with the Gensini score that represents the severity of CAD angiographically (P = .010).\nDocument [19]: Title: Incidence of coronary artery disease before valvular surgery in isolated severe aortic stenosis. Abstract: Angina pectoris has been recognized as one of the principal symptoms of aortic valve stenosis (AS), even in patients without significant coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the incidence of angina pectoris and related CAD in such patients is controversial. There is continuing debate as to whether coronary angiography is necessary before aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with severe AS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of CAD in patients with severe AS in a Korean population.\nDocument [20]: Title: Systemic Cardiac Troponin T Associated With Incident Atrial Fibrillation Among Patients With Suspected Stable Angina Pectoris. Abstract: Higher concentrations of cardiac troponin T are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse cardiovascular prognosis. The relation with incident atrial fibrillation (AF) is less explored. We studied this association among 3,568 patients evaluated with coronary angiography for stable angina pectoris without previous history of AF. The prospective association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) categories (&#8804;3 ng/L; n&#8239;=&#8239;1,694, 4-9; n&#8239;=&#8239;1,085, 10 to 19; n&#8239;=&#8239;614 and 20 to 30; n&#8239;=&#8239;175) and incident AF and interactions with the extent of CAD were studied by Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression. Risk prediction improvements were assessed by receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) analyses. During median (25 to 75 percentile) 7.3 (6.3 to 8.6) years of follow-up 412 (11.5%) were diagnosed with AF. In a Cox model adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and left ventricular ejection fraction, hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 1.53 (1.16 to 2.03), 2.03 (1.49 to 2.78), and 2.15 (1.40 to 3.31) when comparing the second, third, and fourth to the first hs-cTnT group, respectively (P for trend &lt;0.000001). The strongest association between hs-cTnT levels and incident AF was found among patients without obstructive CAD (P<sub>int</sub>&#8239;=&#8239;0.024) and adding hs-cTnT to established AF risk factors improved risk classification slightly (&#916;ROC 0.006, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.044). In conclusion, in patients with suspected stable angina higher levels of hs-cTnT predicted increased risk of incident AF. This was most pronounced in patients without obstructive CAD suggesting an association not mediated by coronary disease.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Gingival hypertrophy (GH) is a well-known physical manifestation due to inflammatory conditions, pregnancy, vitamin C deficiency, systemic diseases like leukemia, Wegners granulomatosis, and various drugs like anticonvulsants, immunosuppresant, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs).We present here a case of a 45-year-old woman, who has been taking Amlodipine 10mg once a day together with Atenelol 50mg per day for one and half years, and has subsequently developed gum hypertrophy. This manifestation was reversed after stopping of Amlodipine. Though this case presentation is described in literature, we hereby present it in a pictorial form, to sensitize the treating physician toward it.\nDocument [2]: Title: [Case of olmesartan and amlodipine intoxication]. Abstract: Although angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is one of the most common drugs for hypertension in Japan, there are few reports of ARB intoxication. We report a case of persistent hypotension caused by intoxication of olmesartan and amlodipine. A 55-year-old female was transferred to our emergency center 4 hours after taking 180 mg of olmesartan and 140 mg of amlodipine. Continuous hypotension occurred after admission. We used norepinephrine up to 0.33 microg/kg/min to keep her systolic blood pressure > 80 mmHg. We also used calcium gluconate as a treatment for amlodipine intoxication. Although it is predicted the abnormality of electrolyte balance, acid-base balance and renal dysfunction, she had recovered with no remarkable disability. With stabilization of her circulation, we reduced the dose of norepinephrine and stopped it on day 3, and she is discharged on day 5. Her serum olmesartan level was 3,980 ng/mL (normal C(max): 273.5 ng/mL), and serum amlodipine level was 104.9 ng/mL (normal C(max): 2.51 ng/mL). We suggest that it is important to stabilize vital sign to treat ARB intoxication as same as other drug intoxication.\nDocument [3]: Title: Exposure to amlodipine in the first trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Abstract: To assess the fetal outcome of three hypertensive women exposed to amlodipine. 5 mg/day, in the first trimester of pregnancy. CASE 1: The patient was treated with amlodipine until 7 weeks of gestation. She was also exposed to levosulpiride, aluminum hydroxide gel, magnesium carbonate, and Ginkgo biloba. At 38(+3) weeks of pregnancy, she delivered a 3750 g healthy female baby, and restarted taking amlodipine, 5 mg/day, while exclusively breastfeeding her daughter. At three months of age, the infant was healthy. CASE 2: The patient was treated with amlodipine from 2(+2) to 3(+4) weeks of pregnancy. Her treatment was modified to atenolol until the week 6(+4 weeks), when she declined any antihypertensive treatment. At 39(+4) weeks of pregnancy, the patient delivered a 2600 g baby. At 20 months old, the baby presented with intellectual delay and weakness in the left arm and hand grasp. These neurological alterations were not attributed to her exposure to amlodipine early in utero. CASE 3: The patient was treated with amlodipine from 7(+6) to 12 weeks of pregnancy. She was also taking sucralfate and lorazepam. At 12 weeks of amenorrhea, ultrasound revealed a 15.3 mm, single fetal pole in the gestational sac without cardiac activity. She underwent dilatation and evacuation of a dead embryo.\nDocument [4]: Title: Is Time an Important Problem in Management of Hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia by Using an Amlodipine-Atorvastatin Single Pill Combination? Abstract: BACKGROUND Is the timing of dosing for amlodipine and atorvastatin important with regard to therapeutic efficacy? To answer this question, we designed an outpatient, practice-based, case-control study lasting 8 weeks. MATERIAL AND METHODS Two hundred patients were divided into 2 groups: in Group I, patients were provided with a single pill containing amlodipine/atorvastatin (5/20 mg) to be taken each night at 10 pm, and in Group II, patients were taking amlodipine (5 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) each morning at 7 am. RESULTS Our results indicated no obvious difference in blood pressure control between the 2 groups. Taking amlodipine at night not only lowered blood pressure, but it also provided better control during the peak blood pressure in the morning. Hypercholesterolemia control in the 2 groups was also not significantly different, taking atorvastatin in the morning was as effective as dosing at night in patients with hypercholesterolemia. While the carotid IMT, hs-CRP, and LVMI were significantly lower after treatment, no differences were found between the 2 groups. Although no obvious difference was found in adverse drug reactions between the 2 groups, compliance was much better in the single-pill group than in patients taking the 2 medications separately. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, single-pill amlodipine-atorvastatin taken at night can lower blood pressure and reduce the morning peak blood pressure levels the next day. Additionally, this dosing method could improve patient adherence to the therapy.\nDocument [5]: Title: Effects of candesartan compared with amlodipine in hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risks: candesartan antihypertensive survival evaluation in Japan trial. Abstract: The Candesartan Antihypertensive Survival Evaluation in Japan Trial was designed to compare the long-term effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan and the calcium channel blocker amlodipine on the incidence of cardiovascular events, represented as a composite of sudden death and cerebrovascular, cardiac, renal, and vascular events in high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients. We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded assessment of the end point in 4728 Japanese hypertensive patients (mean age: 63.8 years; mean body mass index: 24.6 kg/m(2)). Patients were followed for an average of 3.2 years. Blood pressure was well controlled with both treatment-based regimens (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure: 136.1/77.3 mm Hg for candesartan-based regimens and 134.4/76.7 mm Hg for amlodipine-based regimens after 3 years). Primary cardiovascular events occurred in 134 patients with both the candesartan- and amlodipine-based regimens. The 2 treatment-based regimens produced no significant differences in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in the high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients (hazard ratio: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.28; P=0.969). In each primary end point category, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment-based regimens. New-onset diabetes occurred in fewer patients taking candesartan (8.7/1000 person-years) than in those taking amlodipine (13.6/1000 person-years), which resulted in a 36% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.97; P=0.033). We disclosed that candesartan-based and amlodipine-based regimens produced no statistical differences in terms of the primary cardiovascular end point, whereas candesartan prevented new-onset diabetes more effectively than amlodipine.\nDocument [6]: Title: Adherence to calcium channel blocker therapy in older adults: a comparison of amlodipine and felodipine. Abstract: The efficacy of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for treating hypertension appears to be similar, but a variety of factors, including patient characteristics, tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties, may influence treatment adherence and outcome. We aimed to evaluate treatment adherence in clinical practice among older hypertensive adults (50+ years) prescribed amlodipine or felodipine for the first time as part of the California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) program. We used a retrospective, matched, cohort-analysis design. Over 1 year, patients prescribed amlodipine were 21% less likely to discontinue study treatment than those prescribed felodipine. Discontinuation tended to occur early, with 20% and 30% of amlodipine and felodipine patients, respectively, discontinuing treatment after one prescription. A non-significant difference in favour of amlodipine was demonstrated for anti-anginal medication use among patients taking these drugs at baseline. This study suggests that use of amlodipine may be associated with improved adherence, compared with felodipine, among older out-patients in the Medi-Cal program.\nDocument [7]: Title: ARB candesartan and CCB amlodipine in hypertensive patients: the CASE-J trial. Abstract: The Candesartan Antihypertensive Survival Evaluation in Japan (CASE-J) trial was a comparative study of the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker (CCB), amlodipine, regarding the incidence of cardiovascular events in high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients. The study design was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, two-arm, parallel-group comparison study with a response-dependent dose titration and blinded assessment of the end point. The CASE-J trial enrolled 4728 patients, with a mean age of 63.8 years and a mean BMI of 24.6 kg/m(2), who were randomly assigned to either candesartan- or amlodipine-based treatment regimens. Blood pressure was well controlled to the level of less than 140/80 mmHg in both of the treatment regimens. During 3.2 years of follow-up, primary cardiovascular events occurred in 134 patients in each of the two treatment-based regimens, resulting in no significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events between them (hazard ratio: 1.01; 95% confidence interval: 0.79-1.28; p = 0.969). In 404 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, a significantly larger decrease in left ventricular mass index 3 years after enrollment was observed in candesartan-based (n = 205) than amlodipine-based (n = 199) regimens (-22.9 vs -13.4 g/m(2), respectively; p = 0.023). Furthermore, new-onset diabetes occurred in fewer patients taking candesartan than in those taking amlodipine, resulting in a 36% relative risk reduction (p = 0.030). The CASE-J trial demonstrated that both an ARB, candesartan, and a CCB, amlodipine, equally suppressed the incidence of cardiovascular events. The ARB may confer more beneficial effects to hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or for those at-risk of diabetes than CCB.\nDocument [8]: Title: Amlodipine-Induced Gingival Hyperplasia in a Young Male with Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease. Abstract: Gingival hyperplasia is a rare finding in clinical practice. Nevertheless, when it occurs, it is a finding of great value as it can lead to definite clinical diagnosis. The present case is a 19-year-old male who was referred for further management of stage 5 chronic kidney disease. On evaluation, he was found to have gingival hyperplasia. He was evaluated for reversible causes of kidney disease, and since none were found, renal replacement therapy was advised. He had been taking amlodipine for blood pressure control. As this was presumed to be the cause of gingival hyperplasia, it was stopped and replaced by a combination of beta-blocker and prazosin. At six-month follow-up, he had complete resolution of gingival hyperplasia. Amlodipine as a cause of gingival hyperplasia is a rare occurrence. However, it is crucial to keep in mind such a possible side effect of this commonly prescribed antihypertensive drug.\nDocument [9]: Title: Heart failure in ALLHAT: did blood pressure medication at study entry influence outcome? Abstract: J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich). 2009;11:466-474. (c)2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Lower heart failure (HF) rates in individuals taking chlorthalidone vs amlodipine, lisinopril, or doxazosin were unanticipated in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). HF differences appeared early, leading to questions about the possible influence of pre-enrollment antihypertensive drugs. A post hoc study evaluated hospitalized HF events. During year 1479 individuals had HF, with pre-entry antihypertensive medication data obtained on 301 patients (63%). Case-only analysis examined interactive effects (interaction odds ratio [OR, ratio of ORs]) of previous medication and ALLHAT treatment on HF outcomes, eg, did treatment effect differ by pre-entry antihypertensive class? Among cases, 39%, 37%, 17%, and 47% were taking pre-entry diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers, respectively. Interaction OR for year 1 HF for amlodipine vs chlorthalidone for patients taking vs not taking diuretics pre-entry was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-2.21; P=.83); for lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, 1.33 (95% CI, 0.65-2.74; P=.44); and for doxazosin vs chlorthalidone, 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57-2.25; P=.73). Controlling for other pre-entry antihypertensives yielded similar results. There was no significant evidence that pre-entry drug type explained observed hospitalized HF differences by ALLHAT treatment.\nDocument [10]: Title: A rare case report of amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement and review of its pathogenesis. Abstract: Gingival enlargement is a common clinical feature of gingival and periodontal diseases. It is an unwanted side effect of certain systemic drugs given for nondental treatment. It is being reported with three main groups of drugs like calcium channel blockers (CCBs), immunosuppressants, and anticonvulsants. Among calcium channel blockers, nifedipine causes gingival hyperplasia in about 10% of patients, whereas the incidence of amlodipine-, a third generation calcium channel blocker, induced gingival hyperplasia is very limited. There are very few reports of amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement at a dose of 5 mg. We report a case of amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement in a 45-year-old hypertensive patient taking amlodipine at a dose of 5 mg.\nDocument [11]: Title: Drug-induced atypical hyperplasia enveloping salivary gland malignancy. Abstract: Gingival enlargement is a very common side effect associated with the administration of several drugs, mainly anticonvulsants, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and immunosuppressants. Amlodipine (a CCB) is a safe antihypertensive drug with a longer duration of action. Gingival enlargement induced by amlodipine is less prevalent among CCBs. Since the pathogenesis is not well understood, it is still a challenge for clinicians to diagnose and manage cases effectively. This case presents an atypical unilateral palatal gingival enlargement in a 61-year-old hypertensive female taking amlodipine. Difficulty for a pathologist in diagnosing in spite of repeated sample submission from the lesion and repeated failure for the operator to reach the underlying pathology due to amlodipine-induced hyperplasia have also been discussed in this case report.\nDocument [12]: Title: The effect of amlodipine alone and in combination with atenolol on bowel habit in patients with hypertension: an observation. Abstract: The prevalence of hypertension increases with advancing age. The management of hypertension especially in the elderly has its own limitations. Verapamil is not recommended in the elderly on account of high incidences of troublesome constipation. Amlodipine has become very popular with the cardiologists and general physicians. Survey of literature has not yielded any citation where the troublesome effect of amlodipine on the gastrointestinal tract has been reported. In an experimental study on isolated rabbit intestine we have demonstrated that amlodipine dose-dependently inhibit the spontaneous activity of the intestinal tract. With this background the present observational study was planned. A total of 100 hypertensive patients were included in the present study. Fifty patients were on amlodipine alone and 50 patients on combination of amlodipine and atenolol. The main parameter analyzed was the frequency and consistency of stool before and after intake of drug. The relative risk (RR) of developing constipation was 4.00 with 95% CI 0.8930 to 17.917 in amlodipine alone group. From this study it can be concluded that the relative risk of developing constipation is 4 times more in patients who are taking amlodipine alone as compared to those patients who are on combination of amlodipine and atenolol.\nDocument [13]: Title: Chart review of patients receiving valsartan-amlodipine single-pill combination versus valsartan and amlodipine combination for blood pressure goal achievement and effects on the Hamilton anxiety rating/Hamilton depression rating scales. Abstract: This study aimed to compare the Hamilton anxiety rating/Hamilton depression rating (HAMA/HAMD) scale scores and blood pressure (BP) goal achievement associated with the use of valsartan-amlodipine single-pill combinations (SPCs) versus valsartan and amlodipine combination in adult hypertensive patients.A total of 476 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned into the SPC (valsartan-amlodipine) and control (valsartan and amlodipine combination) groups. All patients had an uncontrolled BP (160-179/100-109 mm Hg). BP goal was <140/90 mm Hg. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyze the likelihood of HAMA/HAMD scales, SPCs, control group, and daily dosage number. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the rates of BP goal achievement over time among the 2 groups.A total of 476 patients were included in the study, and 439 patients completed the follow-up and received the index drug therapy. There was a significant difference in BP between the 2 groups on days 28, 42, and 56. Patients who received SPCs had a significantly higher rate of BP goal achievement over time (P = .000). The average HAMD scores in the SPC and control groups were 5.54 and 5.49 and 6.06 and 6.21 on days 28 and 56, respectively. The average HAMA scores in the SPC and control groups were 7.41 and 7.13 and 7.90 and 8.01 on days 28 and 56, respectively. The means of HAMD and HAMA scores were 5.826 and 7.614, respectively. The higher the HAMA/HAMD scores, the lower was the BP goal achievement. The number of drugs taken by the patients was associated with the HAMA and HAMD scores. There was no significant difference between HAMA scores of patients taking 1 tablet daily (7.22 \u00b1 1.885) and those taking two-tablets daily (7.38 \u00b1 1.953) (P = .408). However, when these scores were compared to those of patients taking 4 tablets daily (8.08 \u00b1 2.285), a significant difference was observed (P = .000, P = .000).Hypertensive patients treated with valsartan-amlodipine SPCs were significantly more likely to achieve BP goal and have lesser HAMA/HAMD scores compared to patients treated with valsartan and amlodipine combination.\nDocument [14]: Title: Treatment with triple combination of atorvastatin, perindopril, and amlodipine in patients with stable coronary artery disease: A subgroup analysis from the PAPA-CAD study. Abstract: Background In patients with stable coronary artery disease, aspirin, a statin, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are recommended as first-line agents for secondary prevention. Subgroup analyses of the previously published Hungarian Perindopril plus Amlodipine in PAtients with Coronary Artery Disease (PAPA-CAD) non-interventional trial demonstrated that the addition of the metabolically beneficial, fixed combination of perindopril + amlodipine to atorvastatin further improves the patient's lipid profile. Methods The PAPA-CAD study, a 6-month open-label, prospective, multicenter, observational/non-interventional survey evaluated data accumulated from patients with hypertensive patients with stable coronary artery disease. The herein-reported subgroup analysis was conducted using the findings from those 1130 patients, who were taking atorvastatin in addition to the fixed combination of perindopril + amlodipine at the time of all four study visits (i.e., at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months later). Results In the subgroup of patients taking atorvastatin as an add-on agent, 82.5% reached the target blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg compared with 78.8% of those not taking a statin. The addition of atorvastatin to the fixed combination of perindopril + amlodipine resulted in further significant improvements of key metabolic parameters. Conclusion This subgroup analysis confirmed that favorable synergism exists among perindopril, amlodipine, and atorvastatin.\nDocument [15]: Title: Effect of Co-Administration of Curcumin with Amlodipine in Hypertension. Abstract: Curcumin, a curcuminoid known as the main bioactive compound of turmeric, is used in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. Amlodipine is a general antihypertensive drug used in combination with various other antihypertensive agents. To date, no studies have examined the effects of the co-administration of amlodipine with curcumin. In this study, the vasodilatory effects of curcumin, amlodipine, and the co-administration of curcumin with amlodipine on isolated rat aortic rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine were evaluated, and the hypotensive effects were evaluated using the tail cuff method. To measure blood pressure, male spontaneously hypertensive rats were divided into four groups, each containing six rats, as follows: amlodipine 1 mg/kg alone treated, amlodipine 1 mg/kg with curcumin 30 mg/kg treated, amlodipine 1 mg/kg with curcumin 100 mg/kg treated, and amlodipine 1 mg/kg with curcumin 300 mg/kg treated groups. Amlodipine and curcumin were intraperitoneally injected, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after administration. The combined administration of curcumin and amlodipine induced a stronger vasorelaxant effect than amlodipine alone. However, co-administration did not significantly lower SBP and DBP compared to the single administration of amlodipine. The results of this study suggest that hypertensive patients taking amlodipine can consume curcumin or turmeric for food or other medical purposes without inhibiting the blood pressure-lowering effect of amlodipine.\nDocument [16]: Title: Effect of tablets with a combination of telmisartan and amlodipine on patients with hypertension: the Cotalo study. Abstract: Fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy with telmisartan 40 mg+amlodipine 5 mg (T40/A5) is expected to achieve tight blood pressure (BP) control because of the strong efficacy and long half-life of each drug. The aims of this study were to evaluate the 24-h antihypertensive efficacy of T40/A5 FDC therapy and to explore differences that may arise owing to different administration times in Japanese patients whose hypertension was not controlled by 5 mg of amlodipine per day. In this randomized clinical trial, 44 patients who had been taking amlodipine 5 mg per day and did not achieve their optimal BP target were enrolled (mean age: 67.8\u00b110.2 years). The subjects were then randomly assigned to a T40/A5 morning or evening administration group (22 patients per group). At baseline and 8 weeks after randomization, we evaluated clinical BP and various laboratory values and performed ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Clinical and mean BP evaluated with ABPM at 8 weeks (24 h, daytime, nighttime and early morning) were significantly decreased compared with BP at baseline. There were no significant differences in the diurnal BP profile change from baseline to 8 weeks between subjects in the morning and evening administration groups. There were also no significant differences in the diurnal BP profile change from baseline to 8 weeks between subjects with or without metabolic syndrome. We conclude that T40/A5 FDC therapy significantly decreased the 24-h mean and clinical BP, independent of administration time, in patients whose hypertension was not controlled by 5 mg of amlodipine.\nDocument [17]: Title: Cancer Risk of Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker Valsartan: A Population-based Study. Abstract: Nitrosamine contamination of generic valsartan was found in 2018. This study aimed to investigate whether long-term use of valsartan increases cancer risk. Patients prescribed valsartan or amlodipine (control group) from 1 January 1, 2003, to June 30, 2010, were identified using the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, a territory-wide database in Hong Kong. Patients previously diagnosed with cancer, prescribed both medications, taking the medication, or followed up for <1 year were excluded. Cancer incidence, adjusted for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, was the primary outcome and was estimated using Poisson regression in R version 3.6.1. Among 5023 valsartan users and 3692 amlodipine users, 887 and 740 were diagnosed with cancers during median follow-up periods of 10.97 and 12.12 years, respectively. The adjusted incidence of cancer in valsartan and amlodipine users was 165.29 (95% confidence interval 154.76-175.53) and 180.12 (167.35-193.67) per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The cancer incidence rate ratio of valsartan relative to amlodipine was 0.94 (0.88-1.01). Adjusted incidence rate ratios of valsartan relative to amlodipine were significant for breast cancer (0.63, 0.46-0.86) only. Our findings do not suggest an increase in incidence of cancer with long-term valsartan use. The duration of follow-up of more than 10 years of the study provides the reassurance that an increase in cancer risk is unlikely. Further studies are needed to elucidate the long-term effect of valsartan use on the risk of specific types of cancer.\nDocument [18]: Title: Untypical amlodipine-induced gingival hyperplasia. Abstract: Amlodipine is a third generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is frequently used in therapy of hypertension. Among many side effects, amlodipine has been found associated with gingival overgrowth (GO) which usually occurs within the first three months of starting therapy at a dose of 10 mg/day. However, there are very few reports on amlodipine-induced gingival overgrowth (AIGO) at a lower dose (5 mg/day) and only after short term administration. A 64-year-old male patient with hypertension, who received amlodipine (5 mg/day) for four years, sought medical attention at the Department of Periodontology and Oral Medicine, Institute of Dentistry, Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The patient complained of masticatory problems due to extensive maxillary GO along with pain, bleeding, and foul odor. The clinical and the histological evidences were consistent with AIGO. The first line treatment consisted of the amlodipine substitution (amlodipine was replaced with enalapril, 5 mg/day) and the scaling and root planning/SRP. At one-month follow-up, drug replacement and SRP resulted in some reduction of the inflammation and significant reduction of symptoms. Further, gingivectomy/gingivoplasty helped overcome the effect of these drugs. The possibility of AIGO should be considered for a lower dose, as well as a late presentation.\nDocument [19]: Title: [Blood pressure lowering efficacy of telmisartan and amlodipine taking on the morning or at bedtime: ABPM results]. Abstract: To observe the blood lowering effect of telmisartan and amlodipine taking on the morning or at bedtime in hypertensive patients.\nDocument [20]: Title: Opportunities of Amlodipine as a Potential Candidate in the Evaluation of Drug Compliance during Antihypertensive Therapy. Abstract: <i>Background and Objectives</i>: Blood pressure measurement is essential evidence to establish that the chosen medicine and dosage are appropriate, and also indirectly indicates whether the medicine is being used at all. Therefore, current research compares adherence to the target blood pressure at home and in the hospital between different age groups, using similar combinations of the drugs prescribed by the doctor within ongoing antihypertensive therapy. Moreover, it is very important to develop a method for the determination of amlodipine and its metabolite, which would suitable for clinical applications, when the result is needed as quick as possible. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This prospective study included patients aged &#8805;18&#8201;years who were diagnosed with hypertension. Subjects were divided into two age groups according to European Society of Cardiology (ESC) hypertension guidelines; older patients (&#8805;65 years) and adult patients (&lt;65 years). Assessment of adherence rate to antihypertensive medications was performed using a measurement of systolic blood pressure and comparing this to ESC hypertension guideline data. A simple liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) method for determination of amlodipine and dehydroamlodipine was developed and validated according to the European Medicines Agency guideline on bioanalytical method validation at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis. <i>Results</i>: A total of 81 patients with arterial hypertension were enrolled in this study. A significant number of patients were overweight (N = 33, 40.7%) and obese (N = 36, 44.4%). To control arterial hypertension, 70 (86.4%) patients used fixed-dose combinations, where one of the components was amlodipine. Practically, 36 (44.4%) hypertensive subjects were not able to comply with target blood pressure. Nonetheless, 38 (46.9%) patients who received fixed-dose combinations were able to comply with target blood pressure. <i>Conclusions</i>: Adherence to ESC hypertension guideline proposed target blood pressure was relatively low among hypertensive subjects even though a significant number of patients were taking fixed-dose combinations. Therefore, optimizing prevention, recognition, and care of hypertensive young adults require intensive educational interventions. Moreover, survey data suggest that therapeutic drug monitoring using the validated simple, sensitive LC-MS/MS method is pivotal for further understanding factors influencing adherence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: The average age of women having their first child has been rising in recent decades [1]. Since fertility declines with age, it is not surprising that larger numbers of women over 40 are seeking IVF. Any change in reproductive norms tends to generate concern. Women's apparent postponement of motherhood has met with criticism directed variously at women themselves, and at society for its failure to support women to have children at the 'appropriate' time. The provision of IVF to women over 40 is one facet of this broader social trend towards later reproduction.In this paper I consider a number of ethical problems that might be connected with the provision of IVF to patients over 40. I look at risks to women and offspring, and also consider questions of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. I discuss the possibility that IVF for older women could raise increase the problems associated with egg procurement. Finally I address the concept of medicalisation and suggest that as long as IVF is regarded as a medical treatment, access to it should not be used as a means of social control. Nor should it be provided or withheld on the basis of moral judgements about patients' values or lifestyles.\nDocument [2]: Title: What should be the first-line treatment for unexplained infertility in women over 40 years of age - ovulation induction and IUI, or IVF? Abstract: The tendency to postpone childbearing in developed countries and the relatively high rate of infertility in older women contribute to an increase in the portion of women aged 40 years and older opting for infertility treatments. The main factor for infertility in this group is oocyte senescence, but since this process does not have a specific diagnosis many of those will be classified as having 'unexplained infertility'. The efficacy of the traditional clinical approach for 'unexplained infertility' in older women is questionable. Reviewing the current literature, clomiphene citrate seems to be inefficient in this group of patients, while delivery rates of gonadotrophins and intrauterine insemination cycles are less than 5%. Although low in absolute terms, IVF is more efficient. The chance for delivery, however, diminishes with each year of age above 40. Therefore, after a short trial of gonadotrophins and intrauterine insemination, women aged 40-41 years should be quickly referred to IVF. At an older age, IVF is the primary treatment option.\nDocument [3]: Title: What is the role of assisted reproduction technology in the management of age-related infertility? Abstract: Although in the UK the upper age limit for National Health Service (NHS) provision of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is 39 years of age there has been an increase in number of women having fertility treatment in their 40s. However, the success rates of IVF and intra-uterine insemination (IUI) in this group remain low. Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) data from 2006 showed that the live-birth rate from IVF in the UK was 11% in the age group 40-42, 4.6% in the age group 43-44 and less than 4% in women over 44. We performed a literature search for studies using terms and combinations of terms in online databases and published meta-analyses reporting the outcome of interventions in older women. This review showed that assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs) continue to have low live-birth rates in women over 40. Trials showed that assisted hatching may increase the chance of pregnancy in women with poor history. Blastocyst transfer is associated with better outcome, whereas application of pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) in older women has not increased the success rates. It appears that, with the exception of egg-donation, ART has no answer yet to age-related decline of female fertility.\nDocument [4]: Title: [What is the validity limit of patient reimbursement? Is age a criterion for refusal? Yes....]. Abstract: Selection is probably necessary for women undergoing ART (Assisted Reproductive Therapy), since cost of technique is very important. Furthermore, the right to try to achieve a pregnancy is a debatable issue, since the delivery rates are very low for ageing women. Success rates decrease strongly for women over 40, and women must be informed of it. Women 40 years or older are significantly less likely to achieve pregnancy with IUI as compared to women under age 35. The older women are also significantly less likely to achieve pregnancy with in vitro fertilization (IVF and IVF-ICSI). Costs per cycle were similar, however, for both groups. Moreover, older women utilizing assisted reproductive techniques are four to five times less likely to achieve normal delivery than the younger group, since pregnancy loss rate is greater. This poor prognosis for success in older women adds significantly to the mean cost per pregnancy as compared to younger women. Now, public institutions advocate and impose an age limit upon women who which to undergo ART. Ovulation induction should not be administrated for women over 45 years old (AFSSAPS, 2003). One should recommend not to propose to women over 42 years old and to men over 59 years old (Guidelines, 2004). Moreover, ART techniques cannot be reimbursed for women over 43 years old (CCAM, 2005).\nDocument [5]: Title: Do stimulation characteristics of the first in vitro fertilization cycle predict pregnancy in women of 40 years old and over? Abstract: The failure of tests of ovarian reserve to predict clinical pregnancy in women 40 years old and older prompted this study of the predictive value of information obtained during the first cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Stimulation characteristics during the first IVF cycle attempt were unhelpful in predicting the possibility of clinical pregnancy within the first three consecutive IVF cycles.\nDocument [6]: Title: Can repeat IVF/ICSI cycles compensate for the natural decline in fertility with age? an estimate of cumulative live birth rates over multiple IVF/ICSI cycles in Chinese advanced-aged population. Abstract: In order to find out to what extent ovarian aging could be compensated by the <i>in vitro</i> fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatments, a total of 4102 women above the age of 35 undergoing 6489 complete cycles from 2009 to 2015 with follow-up visits until 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Cumulative live birth rates (CLBRs) across multiple IVF/ICSI cycles were compared in the study population stratified by age and ovarian reserve (classified by the POSEIDON criteria). Younger patients (aged between 35 and 40) could well benefit from repeat IVF treatments, with the optimal CLBRs ranging from 62%-72% for up to four complete cycles. However, the CLBRs sharply declined to 7.7%-40% in older patients (&gt;40yrs). In light of ovarian reserve, the optimal-estimated-four-cycle CLBR of younger patients (35-40yrs) in POSEIDON group 2 could approached to those with normal ovarian response (non-POSEIDON), with 57.3%-70% versus 74.5%-81% respectively. However, the CLBR of older patients (&gt;40yrs) in POSEIDON group 2 only reached 50% of their counterparts. Extending the number of IVF cycles beyond three or four is effective for advanced-aged women, especially in younger normal responders (non-POSEIDON) and unexpected poor/suboptimal responders (POSEIDON group 2). The real turning point at which female fecundity dropped after multiple IVF cycles is at the age of 40.\nDocument [7]: Title: Effect of chronological age of patients with diminished ovarian reserve on <i>in&#160;vitro</i> fertilization outcome. Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chronological age on the <i>in&#160;vitro</i> fertilization (IVF) outcome in patients with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Four hundred and forty-nine women with DOR who underwent IVF cycles were enrolled in the study. There were only 296 patients who obtained available embryos. The patients with no available embryos had a significantly lower antral follicle count (AFC) and higher basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations than those of women with available embryos, but chronological age in the two groups was comparable. However, patients aged &gt;40 obtained a significantly lower ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR) than patients aged 35&#8201;-&#8201;40 or &lt;35 (6.38% <i>versus</i> 26.15% <i>versus</i> 28.17%, respectively). Multivariate analysis also showed that chronological age was the only parameter associated with clinical results. It implied that patients with DOR still have reasonable chances of achieving a pregnancy, but their prognosis is significantly affected by chronological age.Impact statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Diminished ovarian reserve DOR is a disappointing issue in reproductive medicine. Ovarian reserve, which represents ovarian biological age, is closely related to chronological age. However, ovarian biological age does not always match chronological age. Some studies suggest that biological age is more important than chronological age in predicting the outcome of <i>in&#160;vitro</i> fertilization (IVF). However, these conclusions are controversial.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> We found DOR patients with no available embryos had significantly lower antral follicle count (AFC) and higher follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations than that of patients with available embryos, but chronological age in the two groups was comparable. However, for patients with available embryos, chronological age is the only parameter associated with clinical results. For women aged &gt;40 with DOR, chronological age was significantly negatively associated with clinical results.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Patients with DOR can obtain available embryos and still have a reasonable chance of becoming pregnant, but their prognosis is greatly affected by chronological age. Therefore, patients with DOR should seek medical help for pregnancy as soon as possible. When DOR patients over the age of 40 plan IVF treatment, the cost-effectiveness of healthcare should be considered.\nDocument [8]: Title: Effect of maternal age on the outcomes of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). Abstract: This is a retrospective, observational study to evaluate the effect of maternal age on the outcomes of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). 11830 IVF-ET cycles from 10268 women were included. Four groups of different maternal age periods were compared. The groups were 21-30 years old group (4549 cycles), 31-35 years old group (4424 cycles), 36-40 years old group (2429 cycles), and over 40 years old group (428 cycles). The mean starting dose of Gn and mean total dose of Gn in each cycle were significantly higher (P<0.01), while the mean retrieved oocyte number was significantly lower (P<0.01) in groups of higher maternal age period than those in each of the lower groups. The biochemical pregnancy rate and the clinical pregnancy rate were significantly lower (P<0.01), while the miscarriage rate was significantly higher (P<0.01) in groups of higher maternal age period than those in the lower groups. No difference was found in two-pronuclear zygotes (2PN) rate and good quality embryo rate among different groups. Birth defect rate was also comparable in the born babies in different groups. In the group with patients' age over 40 years old, the pregnancy rate was 26.87%, the clinical pregnancy rate was 19.39%, while the miscarriage rate after clinical pregnancy was 36.14%. To draw the conclusion, patients with higher maternal age had worse IVF outcomes. In women of fertile age, patients between 20 and 30 years old have the best IVF outcomes. Patients over 40 years old have poor IVF outcome and high miscarriage rate, which suggested the necessity of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS).\nDocument [9]: Title: DHEA supplementation positively affects spontaneous pregnancies in women with diminished ovarian function. Abstract: The aim of this article is to describe unexpected spontaneous pregnancies in poor responder patients with long-term infertility, when treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF). Our evaluation was carried out in two groups of women. The first group included 39 young women with <40 years, all treated with DHEA because of a previous poor response. The second group included 38 women over 40 years who received DHEA supplementation. Controls for latter group were 24 comparable women who had not been treated with DHEA before the first IVF cycle to evaluate the spontaneous pregnancy rate during preparation to IVF. Three tablets daily of 25 mg micronized DHEA were administered for at least 12 weeks before starting a long stimulation protocol for IVF. Surprisingly, spontaneous pregnancy rate significantly increased after DHEA treatment, allowing to achieve 10 spontaneous pregnancies and 9 spontaneous ongoing pregnancies among young poor responders. Pregnancy rate and ongoing pregnancy rate obtained before starting the IVF cycle were also significantly higher in older women treated with DHEA than in the control group: 21.05% and 13.15% and 4.1% and 0, respectively. Our results show that DHEA supplementation improves the ovarian function in poor responders and in women over 40 years, suggesting that this molecule alone can raise fecundity and fertility treatment success in women with poor prognosis for pregnancy.\nDocument [10]: Title: Ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination in women aged 40 years or more. Abstract: Fertility decreases with advancing age. This study retrospectively reviewed the results of ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination (IUI) in women 40 years old with diminished ovarian reserve or unexplained infertility who underwent treatment with ovarian stimulation/IUI with clomiphene citrate or gonadotrophin and compared them with the results of IVF and in-vitro maturation (IVM) treatments. The main outcome measures were pregnancy and live-birth rates. The profiles of the patients in ovarian stimulation, IVM and IVF groups were comparable. There were no clinical pregnancies in the clomiphene citrate and IVM groups. The clinical-pregnancy rates in the gonadotrophin and IVF groups were 2.6% and 16.9% and the live-birth rates were 2.6% and 13.7%, respectively. Compared with ovarian stimulation, IVF is most effective for women aged 40 years or more. Attempting success with ovarian stimulation or IVM will delay conception unnecessarily.\nDocument [11]: Title: Activated protein C resistance impact on Syrian candidates for in vitro fertilisation and the benefit of anticoagulation therapy: a retrospective cohort study. Abstract: Activated protein C resistance (APCR) is a common thrombophilia, caused mainly by a mutation. The impact of APCR on the efficacy of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) are still unclear, and no solid recommendations for its management were published. To investigate the effect of APCR on IVF outcomes and assess the efficacy of our management protocol, we retrospectively scanned the medical records of women who were tested with APCR assay in 2019 at our fertility centre. The 66 women (12%) positive for APCR had lower odds of reaching clinical pregnancies after IVF 0.18 [95% CI: 0.07-0.47] and fewer live births. The administration of low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin associated with more implantation in treated compared to untreated APCR-positive women with an odds ratio of 43.2 [7.51-248.6]. In conclusion, APCR negatively affects the number of clinical pregnancies after IVF, but anticoagulation therapy can mitigate this effect and significantly increase clinical pregnancies.Impact Statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> The evidence about the impact of APCR on IVF outcomes is still inconclusive. According to the Canadian guideline, routine screening for thrombophilia in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss is not recommended. No clear recommendations regarding the management of APCR in the planning for IVF are yet available.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> APCR significantly increases implantation failure among infertile women who conduct IVF. Management of APCR using LMWH and aspirin was effective in mitigating this effect and increasing successful implantation.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Our findings can support the recommendation to include APCR assay in the routine tests for infertile women conducting IVF, and suggest the combination between LMWH and aspirin as an effective therapy to increase successful implantation in APCR positive candidates. However, more controlled clinical trials are still needed to confirm our results.\nDocument [12]: Title: [Treatment options for age-related infertility]. Abstract: There has been a consistent trend towards delayed childbearing in most Western countries. Treatment options for age-related infertility includes controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization (IVF). A sharp decline in pregnancy rate with advancing female age is noted with assisted reproductive technologies (ART) including IVF. Evaluation and treatment of infertility should not be delayed in women 35 years and older. No treatment other than oocyte donation has been shown to be effective for women over 40 and for those with compromised ovarian reserve, but its pratice is not easy in France hence the procreative tourism. As an increasing number of couples choose to postpone childbearing, they should be informed that maternal age is an important risk factor for failure to conceive.\nDocument [13]: Title: A successful pregnancy and delivery outcome for a 46-year-old woman following <i>in vitro</i> fertilization. Abstract: <b><i>Background</i>:&#8194;</b> Decreased conception rate with advanced maternal age has been well demonstrated. Although this decline becomes apparent at 35&#160;years of age, and accelerates rapidly in women over 40&#160;years of age, we are able to report pregnancy and delivery case for a 46-year-old with <i>in vitro</i> fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). We report a rare case of a successful delivery of a healthy infant by a 46-year-old women following IVF-ET. <b><i>Methods</i>:&#8194;</b> She tried three times with conventional IVF and two times cryopreserved embryo transfer, but she failed to conceive. Low-dose dexamethasone was co-treated the last two times with IVF on the first day of the beginning menstrual cycle daily and continued until retrieval day. We obtained good quality embryos and she became pregnant at the sixth time of IVF which was carried out at the morula and early blastocyst stage. <b><i>Result</i>:&#8194;</b> She finally conceived following co-treatment with low-dose dexamethasone. She delivered vaginally a single male infant with no congenital abnormalities at 40&#160;weeks' (3416&#160;g; 46, XY). <b><i>Conclusion</i>:&#8194;</b> We have demonstrated a successful pregnancy due to obtaining quality embryos using co-treatment low-dose dexamethasone and delivery outcome for a 46-year-old woman using IVF.

Abstract: Treatment discontinuations are an important issue in IVF programmes. In the French context, financial constraint does not intervene in discontinuation until older ages. This study examined treatment discontinuation in IVF programmes, according to the woman's age and when there is no financial burden for couples. Medical records were collected for 3037 women who began their IVF programme between 1998 and 2002 in two French IVF units. Up to four attempts were taken into consideration. Cumulative success (delivery) rates were calculated, as well as discontinuation rates. Multiple imputation was applied to estimate a theoretical cumulative success rate as if no woman discontinued treatment before the end of the IVF programme without delivering. Cumulative discontinuation rates at the end of the IVF programme increased with the woman's age (41% for age <35, 56% for age 35-39, 80% for age \u2a7e40). The benefit in terms of delivery rates of pursuing treatment would be smaller for older women (\u223c10% for age <35, 7% for age 35-39, 4% for age \u2a7e40). Even when treatment is reimbursed, the discontinuation rate is high for older women, suggesting that the strong decrease in success rate with age induces older women to discontinue.

Abstract: Implantation failure could be related to antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). We retrospectively analyzed the usefulness of aPL determination in women undergoing IVF. Conventional aPL of the antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti-\u03b22glycoprotein I (a \u03b22GPI) antibodies, and IgG and IgM isotypes as well as IgA isotype were analyzed in women presenting with at least two implantation failures after in vitro fertilization (IVF). In a population of 40 IVF patients, a total prevalence of 20% (8/40) of aPL was found, significantly different from that of the control population (100 healthy blood donors, P < 0.0005). Among the panels of aPL tested, a \u03b22GPI IgA antibodies were the most prevalent (62.5% 5/8), significantly higher in IVF patients (12.5%, 5/40) than in controls (1%, 1/100) (P = 0.01). No difference according to the numbers of IVF attempts and success of embryo implantation was found between aPL positive and negative IVF patients. In contrast, no accomplished pregnancy with full-term live birth was observed in aPL positive IVF patients. Altogether our data led us to propose aPL assessment, in particular a \u03b22GPI IgA antibodies, in support of IVF treated women. In a perspective way, an early aPL detection could be the basis for defining novel therapeutic strategy.\nDocument [16]: Title: Role of increased male age in IVF and egg donation: is sperm DNA fragmentation responsible? Abstract: The well documented increase in age that women conceive their first child has detracted from a similar change observed in males. As both males and females decide to conceive later, the question of whether this may impact their fertility individually and as a couple becomes even more crucial. A paternal age of over 40 years at the time of conception is a frequently quoted male age threshold, however, currently there is no clearly accepted definition of advanced paternal age or even a consensus on the implications of advancing male age. In this paper, we review some of the potential risks to the offspring of advancing male age and examine. The data available regarding pregnancy outcomes based on paternal age in both the fertile and infertile populations. Within the infertile population specifically, we examine the association between male age and outcomes based on treatment modality, including intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), and donor oocyte IVF. Finally, we discuss the various mechanisms by which male age may impact sperm and fertility potential, including sperm DNA damage.\nDocument [17]: Title: AI-Based Optimal Treatment Strategy Selection for Female Infertility for First and Subsequent IVF-ET Cycles. Abstract: Over the last 20 years, China's infertility rate has risen from 3% to 12.5%-15%. Infertility has become the third largest disease following cancer and cardiovascular disease. Then, the in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) becomes more and more important in infertility treatment field. However, the reported success rate for IVT-ET is 30%-40% and costs are gradually rising. Meanwhile, to increase success rates and decrease costs, the optimal selection of the IVF-ET treatment strategy is crucial. In a clinical work, the IVF-ET treatment strategy selection is always based on the experience of the doctor without a uniform standard. To solve this important and complex problem, we proposed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based optimal treatment strategy selection system to extract implicit knowledge from clinical data for new and returning patients, by mimicking the IVF-ET process and analysing a myriad of treatment decisions. We demonstrated that the performance of the model was different in 10 AI classification algorithms. Hence, we need to select the optimal method for predicting patient pregnancy result in different IVF-ET treatment strategies. Moreover, feature ranking is determined in the proposed model to measure the importance of each patient characteristics. Therefore, better advice can be provided for individual patient characteristics, doctors can provide more valid suggestions regarding certain patient characteristics to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and efficiency.\nDocument [18]: Title: The ethics of using body mass index in in-vitro fertilization risk assessment. Abstract: In-vitro fertilization clinics across the world currently use the body mass index (BMI) to assess risk for and determine access to in-vitro fertilization (IVF); however, clinics vary widely in both setting specific BMI limits for access to IVF and articulating the reasons for their policies. Given that scholars have begun to question the usefulness of BMI for individual health risk assessment, it is striking that ethicists have not yet systematically evaluated the reasons given for using BMI in assessing individuals' risk in IVF treatments. In this paper, I provide the first systematic analysis of the chief arguments currently offered by IVF programs for using BMI as a criterion for risk assessment. Specifically, I articulate empirical concerns about the success of IVF in high-BMI patients, practical concerns about the ability of high-BMI patients to safely undergo procedures associated with IVF, and ethical concerns about the risk-to-reward ratio for high-BMI patients and their potential children. I advance a series of objections to those arguments, using empirical data regarding IVF procedures and analogies with other high-risk conditions including systemic lupus erythematosus, and science regarding the diagnosis of BMI-correlated comorbidities such as high blood pressure or diabetes to argue that BMI alone is not a reasonable criterion for risk assessment in IVF; moreover, the usage of BMI may involve unacceptable violations of the bioethical principles of justice and respect for autonomy. Instead, I hold that IVF programs should rely on more precise laboratory and clinical measurements to evaluate risk in IVF.\nDocument [19]: Title: A Slower Age-Related Decline in Treatment Outcomes After the First Ovarian Stimulation for <i>in vitro Fertilization</i> in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients have a better ovarian reserve and age-related improvement in endocrine disturbances than non-PCOS patients. The effects of age on <i>in vitro fertilization</i> (IVF) treatment outcomes associated with cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) remain unclear. <b>Objectives:</b> To study the effect of age on CLBR after the first ovarian stimulation in IVF in PCOS patients. <b>Method:</b> This retrospective cohort study included 3,502 PCOS patients and 18,596 patients with tubal factor infertility, who underwent their first IVF cycles and subsequent frozen embryo transfer (ET) attempts. The primary outcome was CLBR associated with a single stimulation cycle and secondary outcomes included the implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate (LBR), large for gestational age (LGA) rate, small for gestational age (SGA) rate, and preterm birth (PTB) rate of fresh ET cycles. <b>Results:</b> PCOS patients over 40 years had a higher implantation rate (27.8 vs. 15.7%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), clinical pregnancy rate (51.4 vs. 26.1%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), LBR (42.3 vs. 18.2%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and CLBR (50.0 vs. 21.5%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) than non-PCOS patients over 40 years. These rates were comparable between PCOS patients aged 35 to 40 years and those aged over 40 years (<i>P</i> = 0.263, 0.385, and 0.112, respectively). The changes in the implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and CLBR by age were slower for PCOS patients than for non-PCOS patients (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Among PCOS patients less than 35 years, BMI was negatively associated with CLBR [aOR: 0.961 (0.939-0.985); <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05]; however, among PCOS patients over 35 years, instead of BMI (<i>P</i> = 0.353), age [aOR: 0.891 (0.803-0.990); <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05] and the number of oocytes retrieved [aOR: 1.093 (1.002-1.078); <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05] were significantly associated with CLBR. No significant differences in LGA, LGA, or PTB were detected between PCOS and non-PCOS patients over 35 years (all <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> The declines in treatment outcomes with age are slower for PCOS patients than for non-PCOS patients. For patients over 40 years, PCOS patients have reproductive advantages over non-PCOS patients. In contrast to younger PCOS patients (&lt;35 years), older PCOS patients (&#8805;35 years) may benefit less from taking time to lose weight before IVF treatment, and the immediate initiation of assisted reproductive treatment is essential.\nDocument [20]: Title: Acupuncture in IVF: A review of current literature. Abstract: Women's choice to delay fertility due to various reasons is making subfertility a growing problem and increased use of IVF as a last resort. Despite advances in the technology, IVF success remains low, especially in older women. Hence, many of these women need to undergo several cycles of IVF and are faced with unprecedented anxiety and frustration. In desperation, they resort to anything that might increase the success of their IVF treatment. Acupuncture has gained popularity among the various complementary medicines available and many go privately to have acupuncture while undergoing IVF. Since 1999, in spite of multiple trials and systematic reviews, the beneficial effect of acupuncture in improving the success of IVF remains unproven and debatable. As clinicians, we face the dilemma of what to suggest to our patients when asked about having acupuncture during IVF, given that different meta-analyses have come to different conclusions. Hence, this review is conducted with the aim to summarise the available literature and provide a better insight into this complex and controversial topic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: The large administrative databases of health plans contain information on drug-related medical adverse events (AE) and constitute an increasingly powerful tool for the assessment of drug safety. We conducted a retrospective observational study using an administrative managed care claims database covering 9 million members from diverse regions of the United States. Patients aged >or=18 years who received >or=2 prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs between July 1, 2000 and December 1, 2004 were included in the study. Hospitalizations with diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9]) related to muscle, kidney, and liver were determined for patients exposed to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), fibrates, extended-release niacin, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, or statin combination therapy. A total of 473,343 patients contributed 490,988 person-years of monotherapy and 11,624 person-years of combination dyslipidemia therapy. Rates of hospitalization due to AEs in patients on monotherapy with currently available statins were similar, whereas the incidence of hospitalization for muscle disorders increased 6.7-fold with cerivastatin therapy. Patients who received a lipid-lowering medication with a concomitant cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor had a 6-fold increased rate of muscle disorders, including rhabdomyolysis. Hypertension was associated with a 5-fold increase in both muscle and renal events, whereas patients with diabetes mellitus had a 2.5-fold increased risk of renal events. No hospitalized cases of the index AEs were observed in study subjects during the 6-month period before initiation of the lipid-lowering drug. Statin monotherapy as currently prescribed is generally well tolerated and safe.\nDocument [2]: Title: Risks of Adverse Events Following Coprescription of Statins and Calcium Channel Blockers: A Nationwide Population-Based Study. Abstract: Some statins (simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin) are metabolized by cytochrome P450s 3A4 (CYP3A4). Inhibitors of CYP3A4 including some calcium channel blockers (CCBs) might increase statin blood concentration, owing to drug-drug interactions. Risk of adverse events such as acute kidney injury might occur following the coprescription of CYP3A4-metabolized statins and CCBs that inhibit CYP3A4.This was a population-based cohort study. The study analyzed data of patients treated between 1997 and 2011, retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. We enrolled 32,801 patients who received coprescription of statins and CCBs that inhibit CYP3A4 (amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine nicardipine, nifedipine, and verapamil). These patients were divided into 2 groups, according to whether they had received CYP3A4-metabolized statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin) or non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins (fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin). These 2 groups were 1:1 matched by age, gender, and Carlson comorbidity index. All outcomes were assessed within 90 days following drug coprescription.In this study, 5857 patients received coprescription of CYP3A4-metabolized statins and CCBs that inhibit CYP3A4. There were no differences in comorbidity or use of antihypertensive drugs between patients who received CYP3A4-metabolized statins and those who received non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins. Patients who received CYP3A4-metabolized statins had significantly higher risk of acute kidney injury (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.35-3.35), hyperkalemia (adjusted OR = 2.94; 95% CI = 1.36-6.35), acute myocardial infarction (adjusted OR = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.16-2.07), and acute ischemic stroke (adjusted OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.08-1.68) than those who received non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins.This nationwide cohort study demonstrated the increased risk of adverse events following the coprescription of CYP3A4-metabolized statins and CCBs that inhibit CYP3A4. Therefore, it is important to take into account the potential adverse events while coprescribing CYP3A4-metabolized statins and CCBs that inhibit CYP3A4.\nDocument [3]: Title: Toward \"pain-free\" statin prescribing: clinical algorithm for diagnosis and management of myalgia. Abstract: Myalgia, which often manifests as pain or soreness in skeletal muscles, is among the most salient adverse events associated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Clinical issues related to statin-associated myotoxicity include (1) incidence in randomized controlled trials and occurrence in postmarketing surveillance databases; (2) potential differences between statins in their associations with such adverse events; and (3) diagnostic and treatment strategies to prevent, recognize, and manage these events. Data from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical and observational trials, and post-marketing surveillance indicate that statin-associated myalgia typically affects approximately 5.0% of patients, as myopathy in 0.1% and as rhabdomyolysis in 0.01%. However, studies also suggest that myalgia is among the leading reasons patients discontinue statins (particularly high-dose statin monotherapy) and that treatment with certain statins (eg, fluvastatin) is unlikely to result in such adverse events. This review presents a clinical algorithm for monitoring and managing statin-associated myotoxicity. The algorithm highlights risk factors for muscle toxicity and provides recommendations for (1) creatine kinase measurements and monitoring; (2) statin dosage reduction, discontinuation, and rechallenge; and (3) treatment alternatives, such as extended-release fluvastatin with or without ezetimibe, low-dose or alternate-day rosuvastatin, or ezetimibe with or without colesevelam. The algorithm should help to inform and enhance patient care and reduce the risk of myalgia and other potentially treatment-limiting muscle effects that might undermine patient adherence and compromise the overall cardioprotective benefits of statins.\nDocument [4]: Title: Statin Safety and Associated Adverse Events: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. Abstract: One in 4 Americans >40 years of age takes a statin to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and other complications of atherosclerotic disease. The most effective statins produce a mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 55% to 60% at the maximum dosage, and 6 of the 7 marketed statins are available in generic form, which makes them affordable for most patients. Primarily using data from randomized controlled trials, supplemented with observational data where necessary, this scientific statement provides a comprehensive review of statin safety and tolerability. The review covers the general patient population, as well as demographic subgroups, including the elderly, children, pregnant women, East Asians, and patients with specific conditions such as chronic disease of the kidney and liver, human immunodeficiency viral infection, and organ transplants. The risk of statin-induced serious muscle injury, including rhabdomyolysis, is <0.1%, and the risk of serious hepatotoxicity is \u22480.001%. The risk of statin-induced newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus is \u22480.2% per year of treatment, depending on the underlying risk of diabetes mellitus in the population studied. In patients with cerebrovascular disease, statins possibly increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke; however, they clearly produce a greater reduction in the risk of atherothrombotic stroke and thus total stroke, as well as other cardiovascular events. There is no convincing evidence for a causal relationship between statins and cancer, cataracts, cognitive dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, or tendonitis. In US clinical practices, roughly 10% of patients stop taking a statin because of subjective complaints, most commonly muscle symptoms without raised creatine kinase. In contrast, in randomized clinical trials, the difference in the incidence of muscle symptoms without significantly raised creatinine kinase in statin-treated compared with placebo-treated participants is <1%, and it is even smaller (0.1%) for patients who discontinued treatment because of such muscle symptoms. This suggests that muscle symptoms are usually not caused by pharmacological effects of the statin. Restarting statin therapy in these patients can be challenging, but it is important, especially in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events, for whom prevention of these events is a priority. Overall, in patients for whom statin treatment is recommended by current guidelines, the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.\nDocument [5]: Title: Statin non-adherence: clinical consequences and proposed solutions. Abstract: Large controlled clinical trials have demonstrated reductions with statin therapy in cardiovascular events in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes and stable coronary heart disease and individuals at high risk of a cardiovascular event. In trials of acute coronary syndromes and stable coronary heart disease, high-intensity statin therapy is more effective in the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events than low-intensity statin therapy. Thus, evidence-based guidelines recommend in-hospital initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for all acute coronary syndrome patients. Clinical trials report high adherence to and low discontinuation of high-intensity statin therapy; however, in clinical practice, high-intensity statins are prescribed to far fewer patients, who often discontinue their statin after the first refill. A coordinated effort among the patient, provider, pharmacist, health system, and insurer is necessary to improve utilization and persistence of prescribed medications. The major cause for statin discontinuations reported by patients is perceived adverse events. Evaluation of potential adverse events requires validated tools to distinguish between statin-associated adverse events versus non-specific complaints. Treatment options for statin-intolerant patients include the use of a different statin, often at a lower dose or frequency. In order to lower LDL cholesterol, lower doses of statins may be combined with ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrants. Newer treatment options for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms may include proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors.\nDocument [6]: Title: The effect of lipophilicity and dose on the frequency of statin-associated muscle symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Abstract: Addressing the factors which lead to the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) is vital for maintaining patient compliance with these pharmaceuticals, and thus improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between statin lipophilicity, or dose, and the frequency of adverse muscle symptoms using a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs, including statin monotherapy and placebo groups, which reported data on muscle adverse events were identified through the PubMed and Scopus databases. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. A total of 135 RCTs were included in this review. Statin therapy was associated with a significant, but modest, increase in the risk of adverse muscle symptoms compared to placebo (RR=1.050; 95% CI=1.014-1.089; P=0.007; I<sup>2</sup>=3.291%). This significant association was primarily due to the inclusion of RCTs recruiting participants with a history of statin intolerance. Lipophilic statins had no appreciable impact on the development of SAMS compared to hydrophilic formulations. A univariate meta-regression of dose (standardised to atorvastatin dose equivalents) and the risk of musculoskeletal complaints also showed no significant association. The results obtained from this meta-analysis indicate that there is a slight increase in the risk of SAMS, especially in individuals with a history of statin intolerance. There is limited evidence to suggest that the risk of SAMS would differ between the use of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins, or high- and low-dose therapy.\nDocument [7]: Title: Rationale and design of the CLEAR-outcomes trial: Evaluating the effect of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular events in patients with statin intolerance. Abstract: Although statins play a pivotal role in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, many patients fail to achieve recommended lipid levels due to statin-associated muscle symptoms. Bempedoic acid is an oral pro-drug that is activated in the liver and inhibits cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes, but is not activated in skeletal muscle which has the potential to avoid muscle-related adverse events. Accordingly, this agent effectively lowers atherogenic lipoproteins in patients who experience statin-associated muscle symptoms. However, the effects of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been studied. STUDY DESIGN: Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Included patients must have all of the following: (i) established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or have a high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, (ii) documented statin intolerance, and (iii) an LDL-C \u2265100 mg/dL on maximally-tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. The study randomized 14,014 patients to treatment with bempedoic acid 180 mg daily or matching placebo on a background of guideline-directed medical therapy. The primary outcome is a composite of the time to first cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization. The trial will continue until 1620 patients experience a primary endpoint, with a minimum of 810 hard ischemic events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) and minimum treatment duration of 36 months and a projected median treatment exposure of 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: CLEAR Outcomes will determine whether bempedoic acid 180 mg daily reduces the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events in high vascular risk patients with documented statin intolerance and elevated LDL-C levels.\nDocument [8]: Title: Prevention and management of statin adverse effects: A practical approach for pharmacists. Abstract: Statin-associated adverse effects, primarily muscle-related symptoms, occur in up to approximately one-third of patients in clinical practice. Recently, a Canadian Consensus Working Group outlined 6 key principles to assess and manage patients with goal-inhibiting statin intolerance, defined as a syndrome characterized by symptoms or biomarker abnormalities that prevent the long-term use of and adherence to indicated statin therapy, which includes a trial of at least 2 statins and precludes reversible causes of statin adverse effects. These principles ensure patients are appropriately receiving a statin and aware of both the benefits and risks of therapy. As well, they address factors that may increase the risk of statin-associated myopathy. A thorough assessment of patients' clinical and laboratory history should be performed in any patient presenting with muscle symptoms on statin therapy, followed by a systematic dechallenge/rechallenge approach. In practice, most patients with statin intolerance due to muscle symptoms will be able to tolerate another statin. This is of particular importance because of the relative paucity of compelling evidence demonstrating a cardiovascular benefit with nonstatin therapies. Pharmacists are ideally situated to provide patient education, recommend changes to therapy and monitor patients with goal-inhibiting statin intolerance.\nDocument [9]: Title: The controversies of statin therapy: weighing the evidence. Abstract: The debate whether statins, 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are safe to use has been raging since their introduction in 1987. Statins are generally well tolerated and are believed to have minimal adverse effects. However, individual, specific rare adverse events have been reported, such as elevations of liver enzymes, muscle aches, and very rarely, rhabdomyolysis. Discontinuation and/or reduction in the dose of the statin usually leads to resolution of these side effects. Recently, however, debate has focused on the possible negative long-term effects of statin treatment on cognitive decline, the incidence of cancer, and the development of diabetes mellitus. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded the warning for statins with a statement that statin use may lead to cognitive impairment. In this review, we discuss all levels of evidence, from case reports to large randomized controlled clinical trials, for the possible adverse effects of statins on cognitive decline, cancer, and diabetes. After careful consideration of all discussed scientific evidence, we conclude that there is no increased risk of cognitive decline or cancer with statin use. However, statin use is related to a small increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In view of the overwhelming benefit of statins in the reduction of cardiovascular events, we believe the small absolute risk for development of diabetes is outweighed by the cardiovascular benefits in patients for whom statin therapy is recommended. We, therefore, suggest that clinical practice for statin therapy should not be changed on the basis of the most recent Food and Drug Administration informational warnings.\nDocument [10]: Title: Statin-induced myopathy: the two faces of Janus. Abstract: Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) have been shown to be effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreasing the risk of coronary heart disease. Although safe and well tolerated by most patients, statins have also been associated with muscle-related adverse events. This article reviews statin-associated myotoxicity to clarify the definitions of muscle-related adverse events and discusses their incidences in major statin trials, case reports, and review articles through January 2006. Milder complaints (ie, myalgia) are reported by approximately 5% to 7% of patients who take statins. More severe myotoxicity, namely rhabdomyolysis, is extremely rare for all statins save cerivastatin, and most recent estimates of its incidence are between 0.44 and 0.54 cases per 10 000 person-years. The mechanism of statin-associated myotoxicity has not been satisfactorily defined and is likely due to multiple factors, including membrane instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defects in myocyte duplication.\nDocument [11]: Title: Statin intolerance - an attempt at a unified definition. Position paper from an International Lipid Expert Panel. Abstract: Statins are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in clinical practice. They are usually well tolerated and effectively prevent cardiovascular events. Most adverse effects associated with statin therapy are muscle-related. The recent statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) has focused on statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and avoided the use of the term 'statin intolerance'. Although muscle syndromes are the most common adverse effects observed after statin therapy, excluding other side effects might underestimate the number of patients with statin intolerance, which might be observed in 10-15% of patients. In clinical practice, statin intolerance limits effective treatment of patients at risk of, or with, cardiovascular disease. Knowledge of the most common adverse effects of statin therapy that might cause statin intolerance and the clear definition of this phenomenon is crucial to effectively treat patients with lipid disorders. Therefore, the aim of this position paper was to suggest a unified definition of statin intolerance, and to complement the recent EAS statement on SAMS, where the pathophysiology, diagnosis and the management were comprehensively presented.\nDocument [12]: Title: Statin intolerance - an attempt at a unified definition.

Abstract: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have become one of the most commonly prescribed classes of medications in the United States. While serious adverse events are rare, less serious events are frequently seen. Published guidelines recommend initial screening labs as well as ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes during therapy. Up to 5% of patients will have some muscle complaints while taking statins. Therefore, primary care clinicians will often be faced with real or potential complications of statin therapy. There are well established risk factors for development of these complications. Being aware of a patient's risk and using the lowest effective dose minimizes the occurrence of adverse events. The great majority of these abnormalities either do not require discontinuation of therapy or require only brief interruption of therapy. Judicious and systematic use of laboratory testing will minimize needless evaluation and premature discontinuation of statin therapy.\nDocument [14]: Title: Addition of statins to the standard treatment in patients with cirrhosis: Safety and efficacy. Abstract: This review summarizes the safety and efficacy of statins in patients with cirrhosis. Due to concerns about the safety of statins in patients with impaired liver function, they have recently been investigated as a potential treatment option in cirrhosis. The most clinically significant adverse event is statin-related myopathy, and this may be related to the high serum statin concentrations in the setting of severely impaired liver function. Rhabdomyolysis is the most serious and potentially life-threatening manifestation. It has recently been demonstrated that the recommended dose of simvastatin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis would be 20 mg/d because higher values, such as 40 mg/d, are associated with many adverse events, especially muscle injury. Likewise, simvastatin should not be administered to patients with Model for End-stage Liver Disease score > 12 and/or Child-Pugh class C because of the high risk of severe muscle injury. Due to the pleiotropic effects, the focus on statins has shifted from being considered harmful to something useful. Through these effects, statins could prevent liver-related morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients. Observational studies in large populations of patients with cirrhosis have shown that treatment with statins to decrease high cholesterol levels was associated with a reduced risk of hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma development and death. The few randomized controlled trials in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension showed that statins lower portal pressure, quite likely through a reduction in hepatic resistance. Another large randomized controlled trial in patients with variceal bleeding showed that simvastatin in addition to standard of care did not prevent rebleeding but improved survival rate. Despite these encouraging outcomes, the quality of the evidence regarding the use of statins is low or very low due to the observational characteristics of most of the studies involved. Therefore, it is advisable to perform further randomized controlled trials on a large series of patients with hard clinical endpoints, using different statin types and varying doses. The objectives would be to prevent liver-related morbidity and mortality rather than treating cirrhosis complications to take additional information that makes it possible to add statins to the standard of care of these patients.\nDocument [15]: Title: 2019 Taiwan Society of Lipids and Atherosclerosis expert consensus statement on statin intolerance. Abstract: Statin reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improves clinical outcomes in high risk patients. In general, statin is a safe and well-tolerated medication. However, varieties of adverse effects are reported in some patients and may interfere long-term drug compliance. Statin-associated muscle events and liver function change account for most of these adverse effects. Patients are regarded as statin intolerance if they need to discontinue statin therapy due to these adverse effects. To date, there is no universal standard definition of statin intolerance. But a pragmatic definition of statin intolerance is essential and helpful for clinicians in daily practice. In this article, after expert consensus meetings and literature review, criteria were recommended to identify patients with statin intolerance in Taiwan. The purpose of this statement is to help health care professionals in Taiwan to diagnose and manage individuals who develop muscular and hepatic side effects after statin therapy.\nDocument [16]: Title: Interpretation of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. Abstract: This Review is intended to help clinicians, patients, and the public make informed decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It explains how the evidence that is available from randomised controlled trials yields reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognise the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment. Large-scale evidence from randomised trials shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events (ie, coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one-quarter for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual's absolute risk of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is achieved. For example, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L (77 mg/dL) with an effective low-cost statin regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, costing about \u00a32 per month) for 5 years in 10 000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events from occurring in about 1000 patients (ie, 10% absolute benefit) with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease (secondary prevention) and in 500 patients (ie, 5% absolute benefit) who are at increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event (primary prevention). Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease risk during each year it continues to be taken, so larger absolute benefits would accrue with more prolonged therapy, and these benefits persist long term. The only serious adverse events that have been shown to be caused by long-term statin therapy-ie, adverse effects of the statin-are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large increases in blood concentrations of creatine kinase), new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, probably, haemorrhagic stroke. Typically, treatment of 10 000 patients for 5 years with an effective regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily) would cause about 5 cases of myopathy (one of which might progress, if the statin therapy is not stopped, to the more severe condition of rhabdomyolysis), 50-100 new cases of diabetes, and 5-10 haemorrhagic strokes. However, any adverse impact of these side-effects on major vascular events has already been taken into account in the estimates of the absolute benefits. Statin therapy may cause symptomatic adverse events (eg, muscle pain or weakness) in up to about 50-100 patients (ie, 0\u00b75-1\u00b70% absolute harm) per 10 000 treated for 5 years. However, placebo-controlled randomised trials have shown definitively that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (ie, they represent misattribution). The large-scale evidence available from randomised trials also indicates that it is unlikely that large absolute excesses in other serious adverse events still await discovery. Consequently, any further findings that emerge about the effects of statin therapy would not be expected to alter materially the balance of\nDocument [17]: Title: Molecular mechanisms of statin intolerance. Abstract: Statins reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in primary and secondary prevention. Despite their efficacy, many persons are unable to tolerate statins due to adverse events such as hepatotoxicity and myalgia/myopathy. In the case of most patients, it seems that mild-to-moderate abnormalities in liver and muscle enzymes are not serious adverse effects and do not outweigh the benefits of coronary heart disease risk reduction. The risk for mortality or permanent organ damage ascribed to statin use is very small and limited to cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Statin-induced muscle-related adverse events comprise a highly heterogeneous clinical disorder with numerous, complex etiologies and a variety of genetic backgrounds. Every patient who presents with statin-related side effects cannot undergo the type of exhaustive molecular characterization that would include all of these mechanisms. Frequently the only solution is to either discontinue statin therapy/reduce the dose or attempt intermittent dosing strategies at a low dose.\nDocument [18]: Title: Statin safety and drug interactions: clinical implications. Abstract: The risks of muscle adverse events related to use of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, increase significantly with the addition of interacting drugs to a patient's therapy. The mechanism for most statin drug interactions involves the cytochrome P-450 system, which provides an indication of which drugs may interact. However, it is difficult to predict the probability of a drug interaction in a given patient because there are individual differences in sensitivity to increased statin drug levels. Drug metabolism studies show simvastatin and lovastatin to be especially sensitive to the inhibiting effects of other drugs on the cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme. Atorvastatin metabolism is less affected by inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Case reports, postmarketing surveillance, and clinical trial data demonstrate the clinical effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on statins. Also, through possible inhibition of statin biliary excretion and glucuronidation, gemfibrozil given concomitantly with rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin significantly increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening consequence of statin drug interactions.\nDocument [19]: Title: Statin-Associated Muscle Adverse Events: Update for clinicians. Abstract: Statins are potent medications which reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Their efficacy in cardiovascular risk reduction is well established and indications for their use are expanding. While statins are generally well tolerated and safe, adverse events are relatively common, particularly statin-associated muscle adverse events (SaMAEs), which are the most frequently encountered type of adverse event. Recent guidelines and guideline updates on SaMAEs and statin intolerance have included revised definitions of SaMAEs, incorporating new evidence on their pathogenesis and management. As SaMAEs emerge as a therapeutic challenge, it is important for physicians to be aware of updates on management strategies to ensure better patient outcomes. The majority of patients who are considered statin-intolerant can nevertheless tolerate some forms of statin therapy and successfully achieve optimal LDL-C levels. This review article discusses the recent classification of SaMAEs with emphasis on pathogenesis and management strategies.\nDocument [20]: Title: Statins Neuromuscular Adverse Effects. Abstract: Statins are drugs widely prescribed in high-risk patients for cerebrovascular or cardiovascular diseases and are, usually, safe and well tolerated. However, these drugs sometimes may cause neuromuscular side effects that represent about two-third of all adverse events. Muscle-related adverse events include cramps, myalgia, weakness, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and, more rarely, rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, they may lead to peripheral neuropathy and induce or unmask a preexisting neuromuscular junction dysfunction. A clinical follow up of patients assuming statins could reveal early side effects that may cause neuromuscular damage and suggest how to better modulate their use. In fact, statin dechallenge or cessation, or the alternative use of other lipid-lowering agents, can avoid adverse events. This review summarizes the current knowledge on statin-associated neuromuscular adverse effects, diagnosis, and management. It is conceivable that the incidence of neuromuscular complications will increase because, nowadays, use of statins is even more diffused than in the past. On this purpose, it is expected that pharmacogenomic and environmental studies will help to timely predict neuromuscular complications due to statin exposure, leading to a more personalized therapeutic approach.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

She denied any known precipitant for her depression.She is a ninth grade honors student in the gifted program at a local high school and is described as a talented musician, playing multiple musical instruments as well as soccer and basketball. She has good family support, was sociable, and had several close friends. She denied any history of trauma and denied ever using recreational drugs or other mood-altering substances.At this visit, she reported feeling \"sad and anxious.\" Family history was significant for maternal depression, which persisted through her teens and twenties. Her older sister had been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Beth reported anhedonia, fatigue and irritable mood, lack of motivation, impaired concentration, and anxiety related to failing grades.You decide to begin medication because of the severity of her symptoms, and 1 week after starting fluoxetine 10 mg, she reportedly overdosed on an unknown quantity of acetaminophen. Within a few days of switching to escitalopram (due to persistent gastrointestinal complaints while taking fluoxetine), she developed homicidal ideation. She reported feeling grandiose, empowered, invincible, elated, and \"crazy,\" although she never demonstrated or endorsed psychotic symptoms. She became fixated upon the idea that she could kill someone and \"get away with it.\" At the time she tried to suffocate a peer with her hands, she was described as having \"a glazed over look in her eyes.\" Moods were now described as alternating between depressed and elated, with mood shifts occurring every few days. These symptoms did not improve after the antidepressant medication was discontinued.Subsequently, patient was admitted for acute psychiatric care, at which time she was described as depressed, but with an \"expansive and irritable\" mood, and with obsessive suicidal ideation. She had developed a plan to hang herself in the home. She started to believe that her mother was trying to give her \"poison.\" She reported panic attacks and said that she wanted to be in the hospital where she could feel \"safe.\" She claimed to have an \"entity inside of her body who was a bully\" and who was \"taking over her body\" and stated that he put her hand over her peer's mouth, as she watched.Psychological testing included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent, showed significant paranoia, bizarre mentation, and poor reality testing. Along with interview and observation, it was determined that patient met criteria for the DSM-IV-TR clinical diagnosis of Other Specified Bipolar Disorder, with psychotic features.Aripiprazole was initiated at a dosage of 2 mg; however, moods were still described as fluctuating between extremes every few hours. It was discontinued after reaching 5 mg due to affective blunting. Risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily helped patient to feel and act \"more like herself\"; however, she continued to report significant depression. The addition of lamotrigine 25 mg daily, in addition\nDocument [2]: Title: How Biotin Induces Misleading Results in Thyroid Bioassays: Case Series. Abstract: Biotin is widely available over the counter in different doses and is used medically in the management of hair and nail problems. Recent literature suggested the use of high doses of biotin for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis. We present four cases that show a misleading increase in thyroid function tests toward a false diagnosis of Grave's disease after the administration of 20-30 mg biotin for different periods. All the four cases are free of the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and all of their results returned to baseline values within 24-48 hours after biotin withdrawal. The assemblage of these cases, thyroid assay results, and biotin doses had occurred by chance, with no selection bias, and they represented all cases of biotin interference with thyroid assays in our center during this year. The first case is a 23-year-old female who was diagnosed with Grave's disease during a routine checkup after she ingested a prescribed 20 mg biotin per day for three months for excessive hair fall. The second case is a 19-year-old female with hair and nail problems associated with iron deficiency anemia. She administered a self-prescribed biotin dose of 20 mg a day for a month. She asked an endocrinologist's opinion about a recent increase in her thyroid function tests, with no signs of hyperthyroidism. The third case is a 45-year-old man with near-total thyroidectomy for retrosternal multinodular goiter with compressive symptoms. His usual levothyroxine dose had been decreased from 100 to 50 microgram per day, after which he felt unwell and gained four kilograms, with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. His investigations were consistent with hyperthyroidism while his signs were of hypothyroidism, which was illogical. He was administered 30 mg medically prescribed biotin for nail changes due to recently diagnosed psoriasis. The fourth case is that of one of the authors who volunteered to take 30 mg of biotin daily for one week. His initial investigations were in the normal range but changed within this period to be Grave's disease-like, with no signs or symptoms. In conclusion, the ingestion of 20 mg or more of biotin may lead to a clinically relevant thyroid assay interference. The clinicians must take this point in consideration before assessing the results of any thyroid function tests.\nDocument [3]: Title: Anti-epileptics alter hypothyroidism of patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. Abstract: Objective: Anti-epileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine (CBZ) or phenytoin, may induce hypothyroidism in epilepsy patients. We assessed thyroid function of chronic patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities (SMID) in our hospital. Methods: We examined thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and free thyronine (fT3) in 73 patients with SMID (47 men and 26 women, average age 48.4 years, range 30-68 years) without thyroid hormone supplement therapy. We determined the relationship between the thyroid function of patients taking the anti-epileptic drugs CBZ, valproate (VPA), and phenobarbital, other medications including anti-psychotic drugs, and treatments without anti-epileptic or anti-psychotic drugs. Results: TSH levels were not significantly different between the groups taking CBZ (CBZ+med), other anti-epileptic drugs or anti-psychotic drugs (CBZ-med), and only medications without anti-epileptic or anti-psychotic drugs (Non-med). The CBZ+med group had significantly lower fT4 levels than the CBZ-med or Non-med groups. There was a negative correlation between thyroid function level and the phenobarbital groups. TSH levels of the VPA+med group were significantly higher than VPA-med and Non-med group; fT3 and fT4 levels were not significantly different. Conclusions: Our results indicate that hypothyroidism may be present in patients with SMID taking anti-epileptic drugs. This suggests it is important to regularly measure thyroid function in patients with SMID taking anti-epileptic drugs, especially CBZ.\nDocument [4]: Title: An evidence-based approach to managing the anticoagulated patient in the emergency department. Abstract: You start another busy shift with a double row of charts waiting to be seen. Your first patient is an elderly man who fell 1 hour prior to presentation. He did not lose consciousness, but he was dazed for a few minutes. He complains of a mild headache but denies any neck pain. He takes warfarin for valvular heart disease. He looks good and has no focal neurological complaints. His mental status is normal, he has a negative head CT scan, and his INR is 3.9. His family wants to take him home, which would help relieve some of the congestion in the ED, but you wonder what would be best. To observe and repeat imaging? Reverse his anticoagulation? Change his dosing regimen of warfarin? In the next room, you quickly evaluate a 51-year-old obese woman with nonspecific back and abdominal pain that started 24 hours before and has slowly progressed to become intolerable. She denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. She is on the last day of a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin for a UTI. She takes warfarin for a pulmonary embolus that occurred 2 months prior. Her hematocrit is mildly decreased, and her white blood count is normal; however, the INR is 6.8. You wonder if her abdominal pain is related to the UTI, or if it could be somehow related to the prolonged INR. In fact, you wonder why her INR is so prolonged...\nDocument [5]: Title: [Determining the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 in the urine: an unreliable test for hypothyroidism]. Abstract: A 24-year-old woman complained of tiredness, sensitivity to cold, and feelings of depression. A diagnosis of hypothyroidism based on decreased 24 h urinary T3 and T4 excretion was made, and she was treated with levothyroxin. No blood tests were done. She was referred with the question if she had other endocrine disorders. Her periods were regular, and on physical examination no abnormalities except slight acne were found. Similarly, hypothyroidism was diagnosed by decreased thyroid hormone excretion in 24 h urine, again without blood tests, in a 68-year-old woman whose mother had a goitre, and who had already been prescribed liothyronine. She had no complaints, and physical examination was unremarkable. The thyroid gland was not palpable. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were absent in both patients. After discontinuation of medication with thyroid hormones they both remained euthyroid. It is concluded that thyroid disease did not exist in those 2 patients. Measurement of 24 h urinary T3 and T4 excretion is not an accurate diagnostic test for hypothyroidism.\nDocument [6]: Title: Improvement of Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria With Levothyroxine: A Case Report and Review of Literature. Abstract: There is an increased association between chronic urticaria (CU) and thyroid autoantibodies. We presented a case of a patient suffering from CU and newly diagnosed Hashimoto's thyroiditis in which levothyroxine therapy completely resolved the symptoms of urticaria. A 58-year-old female with a past medical history of recurrent urticaria presented with complaints of fatigue and weight gain. Laboratory investigations showed a high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level and a low free thyroxine (T4) level. She had elevated levels of antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-TG). She was diagnosed as a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and started on levothyroxine therapy. She noticed that her uncontrolled recurrent urticaria started to get better and after a few months of therapy, she stopped taking her topical ointments and antihistamines. The reason for the association between positive serological tests for thyroid autoimmunity and CU is unclear. The resolution of chronic urticaria with levothyroxine in our patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis suggests a common underlying mechanism between the two pathologies.\nDocument [7]: Title: Pomalidomide-induced hypothyroidism. Abstract: Hypothyroidism is a recognized side effect of thalidomide drugs. We herein report a case of 83-year-old Irish female with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and a background history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Our patient received pomalidomide and multiple courses of chemotherapy and achieved very good initial response for her multiple myeloma but subsequently she relapsed. She did not have any past history of thyroid disease or family history of thyroid disorders. Prior to treatment with pomalidomide, her thyroid function test was completely normal. She was commenced on pomalidomide in February 2017. Four weeks post treatment, she presented with worsening fatigue, and as a part of her workup, a thyroid function test was performed. Her free T4 was low at 7.2 pmol/L (reference range: 9.0-20.0) while her TSH was elevated at 44.7 mIU/L (reference range: 0.35-4.94). Pomalidomide treatment was terminated, and she was commenced on thyroid hormonal therapy replacement therapy with thyroxine with good clinical and biochemical response. Practitioners prescribing pomalidomide should be aware of this potential complication and patients who are receiving immunomodulatory drugs like pomalidomide should undergo regular thyroid hormone levels screen.\nDocument [8]: Title: The riches of e-prescribing. Insurers will say, do pretty much anything to get physicians to prescribe medications electronically. Ever wonder why? Abstract: Insurers are leading the charge for e-prescribing, a technology that promises to save them big bucks. But they don't always agree on the best way to ensure adoption. WellPoint is sticking with a sponsorship-based model. \"Unless you have the health plans pushing this, it will take a mandate from Congress or decades for e-prescribing to be adopted widely,\" says WellPoint's Charles Kennedy, left.\nDocument [9]: Title: Total thyroidectomy in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative considerations. Abstract: A female patient was admitted to our Department for total thyroidectomy in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. The drug was prescribed for ventricular arrhythmia and atrial paroxysmal fibrillation in dilated cardiomyopathy due to chronic aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 35%; Class Functional NYHA III) and moderate-severe respiratory insufficiency. The cardiologist-anesthetist team has allowed to evaluate the surgical-cardiovascular-anesthesiologic risks and the balance between the improvement by the amiodarone administration for the arrhythmia, and the discontinuation of this treatment in order to prevent aggravation of the thyrotoxicosis. These hypotheses were subsequently discharged for the two reasons listed below: - several other antiarrhytmic drugs (that didn't show equivalent efficacy as amiodarone in preventing or converting such ventricular and atrial arrhythmias) may be proposed in the place of amiodarone. However, this could expose the patient to an arrhythmia; - a clear proof that the suspension of amiodarone can allow restoring normalization of the thyroid function doesn't exist. Therefore, the patient has been successfully submitted to the surgical intervention and in the follow-up we brought her back to a state of normalized thyroid function and cardiovascular conditions. In patients that cannot safely discontinue amiodarone or when medical therapy is ineffective in controlling thyrotoxicosis, thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice.\nDocument [10]: Title: [A case of elderly myxedema coma patient with end-stage renal failure]. Abstract: 84-year-old woman had been diagnosed hypothyroidism before, but she did not take tablets of thyroid hormone prescribed. Anorexia and decreased consciousness level were discovered by workers of the facility. Her family doctor found thyroid function abnormality as a cause, and she was introduced to our hospital to treat because the whole body condition was bad. Her physical examination was observed that JCS was 3-10. Laboratory examination showed that TSH 562.81 \u03bcIU/mL, fT4 0.40 ng/mL, pH 7.33, and Na 124 mEq/L. It was not a contradictory finding with the diagnostic criteria of mucus edema coma. Blood and peritoneal dialysis is denied, although her data indicated eGFR 8-10 ml/min/1.73 m2. Her hospitalization was long-term, but exhibited finally good clinical course. After three months of hospitalization, she was discharged from the hospital. The problems were as follows. The clear guideline of myxedema coma with end-stage renal failure state and many complications was not found. She and her family did not hope dialysis under this condition.We treated a case of myxedema coma in a case of an elderly person with terminal renal failure who did not hope dialysis. In addition to myxedema coma as a rare disease, there are many basic diseases in the elderly. Although it was a difficult case, it is important to repeatedly confirm the explanation and the intention of the person and the family with regard to the selection of the treatment policy.\nDocument [11]: Title: Gastrointestinal bleeding and possible hypothyroidism. Abstract: An 88-year-old female, living independently in the community, developed duodenal and gastric ulcers from using overthe-counter naproxen sodium for pain related to a shoulder fracture and arthritis of the knees. She was hospitalized and received packed red blood cells and intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy. During her hospitalization, she developed atrial fibrillation (AF). Warfarin was not prescribed for stroke prevention because of the gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient was initially placed on atenolol, and then amiodarone was added. After a two-week hospital stay she was discharged to a nursing facility to gain strength, further correct her anemia, and receive physical therapy for the shoulder and ambulation problems from arthritis of the knees. The amiodarone was continued in the nursing facility. After 15 days of amiodarone therapy (hospital and nursing facility), a laboratory report indicated an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Levothyroxine was prescribed. The patient was eventually discharged to an assisted living facility once her strength returned and her ambulation improved. GI bleeding with anemia and weakness from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and changes in thyroid function with amiodarone therapy for AF will be discussed.\nDocument [12]: Title: An Unusual Presentation of Subacute Thyroiditis As Pyrexia of Unknown Origin With Normal Thyroid Functions. Abstract: Subacute thyroiditis is a rare condition believed as immune-mediated inflammation of the thyroid gland that frequently manifests after a viral upper respiratory tract infection. A 52-year-old South-Asian female patient presented to Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) with feeling unwell and sore throat. Moreover, she reported low-grade fever, fatigue, headache, and breathlessness on exertion for the past five weeks. She had a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. She had no associated cough, rigors, chills, urinary symptoms, night sweats, or weight loss. There was no history of recent travel abroad. On examination, she was tachycardic; however, there was no lymphadenopathy, palpable thyroid gland, skin rash, or signs of infective endocarditis. Routine blood analysis showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and normal white blood cell count. Her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was normal. Chest X-ray and echocardiogram were unremarkable. She was prescribed clarithromycin with no effect. After inconclusive results of the routine investigation and no response to antibiotics, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis (TAP) was performed, which revealed a thickened thyroid isthmus. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan revealed bulky appearances of the thyroid gland with diffuse increased uptake suggestive of thyroiditis. Prednisolone 30mg daily was prescribed, which was later reduced by 5mg weekly for six weeks. The patient showed improvement in symptoms, and normal ESR and CRP were achieved.\nDocument [13]: Title: Aggression in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Supporting the Entire Family. Abstract: Juanita is a 13-year-old non-verbal Latina girl with autism spectrum disorder, moderate intellectual disability, and a seizure disorder whose aggressive behaviors toward her parents have significantly worsened over the past few months.Juanita's monolingual Spanish-speaking parents are here today for medication management at her primary care clinic. The parents report that Juanita pinches them, pulls their hair, and hits her head with her fists. Her aggression toward them is usually triggered by feelings of frustrations, leaving her parents feeling like they have to walk on eggshells around her and have led to differing parenting styles. Her father reports that he tries to avoid getting her upset and prefers to watch TV with her, whereas her mother takes on the day-to-day caretaking. Although he wants to take a more active role in parenting Juanita, when he tries, Juanita becomes more aggressive and reacts violently toward him.During the visit, Juanita keeps her eyes downcast, is withdrawn, and some strain is noted between her parents. While speaking to them, Juanita's mother chimes in and reports that she considers herself the primary caregiver and the one who knows her daughter the best. She often dismisses Juanita's father's reporting, saying that \"he doesn't know what really is going on.\" When Juanita is taken to the restroom by her mother, her father tearfully reports that he feels that it may be best for everyone that he leaves the family because of Juanita's worsening aggression toward him and the toll it is taking on his marriage. How would you approach her management?\nDocument [14]: Title: Thyroidectomy in a patient with thyroid storm: report of a case. Abstract: Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition that is generally considered to be a contradiction to surgical intervention. We herein describe the case of a 37-year-old patient with a history of Graves' disease who was transferred to Tottori University Hospital with thyroid storm. She had been followed by her family doctor since 2006, but she had stopped taking her medication of her own volition in 2010. About ten days prior to her admission at our hospital, she consulted her family doctor with complaints of dyspnea, palpitations and general fatigue. Subsequent thyroid function tests showed TSH < 0.01 \u03bcU/ml, FT3 25.0 pg/ml and FT4 8.0 ng/dl. She also had acute heart failure, atrial fibrillation and hepatic failure. A diagnosis of thyroid storm was made and she was transferred to our hospital. She received steroids, beta blockade, potassium iodide, and plasma exchange, but her hepatic failure did not resolve and her clinical condition deteriorated. The decision was made to proceed with thyroidectomy. Postoperatively, her hepatic function normalized. Thus, thyroidectomy is a potential therapeutic choice for cases of thyroid storm refractory to medical management.\nDocument [15]: Title: [Power of personal goal sharing--treatment plan using personal goal maps for patients with mental disorders]. Abstract: A female patient in her sixties with schizophrenia had secretly disposed of all her medication and was not cooperating with hospital staff for about four months. During one of our consultations she mentioned that she wanted to be out of hospital by a certain date. That date happened to be her grandchild's birthday. It was at this point that she shared her goals with us, and voluntarily started having treatment. She was able to return home three months later, just in time to celebrate her grandchild's birthday with her family. A male patient in his sixties was able to leave the seclusion room after 10 years. The first doctor in charge and other hospital staff had firmly believed that releasing him from the seclusion room wasn't a possibility. However the patient decided he wanted to be discharged and was interested in finding out how to go about it. The moment he realized it was possible, his outlook changed immensely. He gradually started to open up and communicate better with his new doctor in charge, and was able to work towards his newly found goals. Staff members were also surprised when he was able to leave the seclusion room. They realized this patient was another person like them who had dreams and goals, and stopped stereotyping patients who seemed to be 'difficult to handle'. I have always experienced the power of goal sharing at clinical scenes, and have noticed its importance for patients making a start on the road to recovery. In order to discuss goals and the way to go about achieving them, I use a simple drawing of a mountain. I call this mountain 'A Personal Goal Map'. I like to think of myself (the doctor) as the mountain guide, and my patient as the mountain climber. The three key philosophies are acknowledging individuality, diversity and freedom. These are important when we think about where we are now, where we are going, and where we want to be. Firstly at the start point, we need to define the patient's problem and discuss ideas and goals, which help us along the Trust Path. The more patients and staff trust and understand each other the easier it is to climb up the Initial Treatment Path. We need to build up trustful relations so we can share personal goals and make a proper assessment and diagnosis, and talk about the safety, efficacy, cost and suitability of the initial treatment. Secondly, we need to take a rest and make more plans for the Recovery Path. It is on this path that we decide on comprehensive treatment together. We may be able to improve the patient's cognitive functions by using atypical anti-psychotic agents. We can then give them information, instructions and warnings about medicine usage so the patient is able to understand their condition. It is only after the patient can understand these things fully and act positively that we can start to climb the final path, the Achievement\nDocument [16]: Title: Hypothyroidism masquerading as depression: the role of noncompliance. Abstract: Compliance with prescribed medication is an important but complex issue which is incompletely understood. Depression is also a factor that can lead to noncompliance. A 30-year-old lady was seen in the outpatient clinic with complaints of palpitations and tremor. Her medical history revealed a subtotal thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter five years earlier. During a period of depression, she stopped taking levothyroxine for 45 days. Discontinuation of therapy worsened her depression. At her visit, the dosage of levothyroxine was increased, and the symptoms of depression improved. However, increasing the dosage of thyroid supplement resulted in a hyperthyroid state. The role of depression on noncompliance is also discussed.\nDocument [17]: Title: A 20-year-old woman with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Evans' syndrome. Abstract: Here we report the case of a 20-year-old female patient previously diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism, and who had been taking synthetic thyroxine (100 microg/day) for eight months. She experienced intermittent dizziness and generalized weakness, and was diagnosed as having severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). We prescribed prednisolone treatment and continued synthetic thyroxine administration. Two years and five months later, she developed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and was diagnosed with Evans' syndrome. Thereafter, laparoscopic splenectomy was performed because her autoimmune hemolytic anemia was refractory and dependent on steroid therapy. The HLA genotypes of the patient were HLA-A*020101/A* 2602, HLA-B*270502/B*5401, HLA-Cw*0102/Cw*020202, HLA-DRB1*0404/DRB1*0405, and HLA-DQB1*0302/DQ B1*0401. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is often associated with other nonendocrine autoimmune diseases, and antithyroid antibodies are frequently observed in Evans' syndrome (coexistence of AIHA and ITP). However, there is no report of Evans' syndrome developing in patients with overt hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This case suggests that three autoimmune diseases (AIHA, ITP, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis) might share a common immunogenetic pathway in pathogenesis.\nDocument [18]: Title: Adrenal insufficiency from steroid-containing complementary therapy: importance of detailed history Abstract: A 62-year-old Asian British female presented with increasing tiredness. She had multiple co-morbidities and was prescribed steroid inhalers for asthma. She had also received short courses of oral prednisolone for acute asthma exacerbations in the last 2 years. Unfortunately, the frequency and dose of steroids for asthma was unclear from history. Her type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) control had deteriorated over a short period of time (HbA1c: 48\u201385 mmol/mol). Blood tests revealed undetectable cortisol and ACTH (<28 mmol/L, <5.0 ng/L). Renin, electrolytes and thyroid function were within normal limits. A diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency, likely due to long-term steroid inhaler and recurrent short courses of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations was made. Patient was commenced on hydrocortisone 10 mg, 5 mg and 5 mg regimen. Steroid inhaler was discontinued following consultation with respiratory physicians. Despite discontinuation of inhaled steroids, patient continued not to mount a response to Synacthen\u00ae. Upon further detailed history, patient admitted taking a \u2018herbal\u2019 preparation for chronic osteoarthritic knee pain. Toxicology analysis showed presence of dexamethasone, ciprofloxacin, paracetamol, diclofenac, ibuprofen and cimetidine in the herbal medication. Patient was advised to discontinue her herbal preparation. We believe the cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency in our patient was the herbal remedy containing dexamethasone, explaining persistent adrenal suppression despite discontinuation of all prescribed steroids, further possibly contributing to obesity, hypertension and suboptimal control of DM. In conclusion, a comprehensive drug history including herbal and over-the-counter preparations should be elucidated. Investigation for the presence of steroids in these preparations should be considered when patients persist to have secondary adrenal insufficiency despite discontinuation of prescribed steroid medications.\nDocument [19]: Title: Pembrolizumab-Induced Thyroiditis. Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors act to restore T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. By this nature, these cancer immunotherapy drugs are associated with various immune-related adverse events such as thyroid dysfunction. We describe a case of thyrotoxicosis secondary to a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab. A 30-year-old female was started on pembrolizumab immunotherapy for stage III small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type. Thirteen days after her second cycle of therapy, she presented with symptoms consistent with thyrotoxicosis. A thyroiditis was diagnosed by thyroid function tests and ultrasonography. She was originally treated with prednisone and metoprolol for possible Grave's disease. Pertechnetate thyroid scan was more consistent with thyroiditis secondary to pembrolizumab. She underwent a total thyroidectomy 10 days after initial presentation for refractory thyrotoxicosis despite maximal medical therapy. Her symptoms resolved and thyroid function tests significantly improved. Pathology was consistent with severe thyroiditis. Immune microenvironment may play a role in the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Chronic inflammation surrounding tumor upregulates PD-L1 expression on tumor cells by the release of cytokines, which acts to inhibit tumor destruction. We suggest that our patient had an undetected chronic inflammation of the thyroid, specifically Hashimoto's thyroidits, which predisposed her to thyroid destruction when taking pembrolizumab. Understanding that an inflammatory environment impacts thyroid toxicity to PD-1 inhibitor therapy is novel and should be further studied.\nDocument [20]: Title: What great managers do. Abstract: Much has been written about the qualities that make a great manager, but most of the literature overlooks a fundamental question: What does a great manager actually do? While there are countless management styles, one thing underpins the behavior of all great managers. Above all, an exceptional manager comes to know and value the particular quirks and abilities of her employees. She figures out how to capitalize on her staffers' strengths and tweaks her environment to meet her larger goals. Such a specialized approach may seem like a lot of work. But in fact, capitalizing on each person's uniqueness can save time. Rather than encourage employees to conform to strict job descriptions that may include tasks they don't enjoy and aren't good at, a manager who develops positions for his staff members based on their unique abilities will be rewarded with behaviors that are far more efficient and effective than they would be otherwise. This focus on individuals also makes employees more accountable. Because staffers are evaluated on their particular strengths and weaknesses, they are challenged to take responsibility for their abilities and to hone them. Capitalizing on a person's uniqueness also builds a stronger sense of team. By taking the time to understand what makes each employee tick, a great manager shows that he sees his people for who they are. This personal investment not only motivates individuals but also galvanizes the entire team. Finally, this approach shakes up existing hierarchies, which leads to more creative thinking. To take great managing from theory to practice, the author says, you must know three things about a person: her strengths, the triggers that activate those strengths, and how she learns. By asking the right questions, squeezing the right triggers, and becoming aware of your employees' learning styles, you will discover what motivates each person to excel.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: We evaluated the clinical features of postoperative anterior blepharitis following cataract surgery and the efficacy of topical azithromycin retrospectively. Thirty eyes of 30 patients with a clinical diagnosis of anterior blepharitis by 6&#160;months postoperatively among those who underwent cataract surgery at our institution between November 2020 and June 2022 were included. The diagnosis of anterior blepharitis and the assessment of objective and subjective findings were based on the American Academy of Ophthalmology Blepharitis Preferred Practice Pattern<sup>&#174;</sup>. Azithromycin eye drops were prescribed for all patients, and findings and symptoms before and after the drops were reviewed. The time of onset ranged from 2&#160;weeks to 6&#160;months after cataract surgery, with the most common onset at 2 to 3&#160;months postoperatively (mean time of onset 79.4&#8201;&#177;&#8201;39.6&#160;days). The type of anterior blepharitis was staphylococcal blepharitis in 26 eyes and seborrheic blepharitis in 4 eyes, while mixed type with posterior blepharitis was noted in 6 eyes. Symptoms at the time of examination included irritation (including foreign body sensation) in 24 eyes, tearing in 4 eyes, and redness in 3 eyes. The findings and symptoms of anterior blepharitis were alleviated or resolved with azithromycin eye drops in 26 of the 30 eyes, but the blepharitis recurred in 6 of these eyes, requiring azithromycin eye drops to be re-prescribed. The onset of anterior blepharitis after cataract surgery may be related to a gradual decrease in postoperative eye drops. Patients tended to complain of irritation and foreign body sensation, and azithromycin eye drops were effective in such cases.\nDocument [2]: Title: Factors of noncompliance with prescribed eye drops in patients undergoing cataract surgery. Abstract: In the face of enormous evidence supporting the significance of using prescribed eye drops before and after cataract surgery, noncompliance is still a common issue. Improvements in cataract surgical procedures with no dedication to support patients throughout their pre-operative management and post-operative recovery deliver low-quality healthcare and may lead to substantial harm to the patient and the public. Therefore, it is vital for clinicians to carefully address the factors of noncompliance with prescribed eye drops and then educate their patients regarding this. This article provides full details of the factors affecting noncompliance with prescribed eye drops in patients undergoing cataract surgery.\nDocument [3]: Title: Do evidence-based guidelines change clinical practice patterns? Abstract: In 2013, the Danish Health and Medicines Authorities published a National Clinical Guideline on the treatment of age-related cataracts. The guideline provided evidence-based recommendations on the indication for cataract surgery, cataract surgery in patients with age-related macular degeneration, on the use of toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) to correct preoperative corneal astigmatism, the use of intracameral and topical antibiotics to prevent endophthalmitis, choice of anti-inflammatory medication to control postoperative inflammation and prevent cystoid macular oedema, the use of immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery and on the postoperative check-up of patients. A questionnaire was sent to all members of the Danish Ophthalmological Society before and after publication of the guideline. The responses showed that the guideline had changed practice patterns so that surgeons were more likely to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory eye drops and to not prescribe topical antibiotic eye drops after the guideline was published. Other parameters, most notably the use of toric IOLs and use of postoperative examinations were more guided by reimbursement standards than by evidence-based medicine. Thus, evidence-based guidelines do change practice patterns unless they are counteracted by the reimbursement system.\nDocument [4]: Title: Transzonular Triamcinolone-Moxifloxacin Versus Topical Drops for the Prophylaxis of Postoperative Inflammation After Cataract Surgery. Abstract: <b><i>Purpose:</i></b> To compare the safety and efficacy of an intraoperative transzonular injection of triamcinolone-moxifloxacin (Imprimis' Tri-Moxi 15&#8201;mg/1&#8201;mg/mL) to topical drops in patients undergoing cataract surgery. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Between January 2017 and October 2017, patients undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery by a single surgeon at the Penn State Eye Center were offered a single intraoperative injection of transzonular triamcinolone-moxifloxacin in lieu of perioperative drops. Between November 2017 and July 2018, the transzonular injection was not offered, and all patients who underwent surgery by the same surgeon received a drop regimen consisting of polymyxin b/trimethoprim and prednisolone acetate 1%. Patients were seen 1 day, 1 week, and 6-9 weeks postoperatively. Outcome measures included incidence of intraoperative complications, postoperative breakthrough inflammation, cystoid macular edema, and infectious sequela. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of the 198 eyes, 99 from 73 patients received the injection and 99 from 82 patients received topical drops. One (1%) intraoperative posterior capsule tear occurred in each group. Eleven (11.1%) eyes in the injection group and 3 (3%) in the drop group experienced symptomatic breakthrough inflammation necessitating treatment (<i>P</i>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0488). One (1%) eye in the injection group and zero (0%) in the drop group developed clinically significant macular edema (<i>P</i>&#8201;=&#8201;1.0). No instances of elevated intraocular pressure or infectious sequela occurred in either group (<i>P</i>&#8201;=&#8201;1.0). <b>Conclusions:</b> Transzonular injection of triamcinolone-moxifloxacin may be associated with an increased incidence of breakthrough inflammation compared to topical drops.\nDocument [5]: Title: Assessment of the eye surface and subjective symptoms after using 0.1% dexamethasone drops with and without preservatives in patients after cataract surgery. Abstract: Cataract surgery can cause dry eye symptoms. One of the many factors compromising the ocular surface is the use of benzalkonium chloride (BAC)-preserved topical eye drops administered during the postoperative period. In this open-label, prospective, randomized, comparative clinical trial, 40 patients not previously affected by dry eye disease were assigned to receive either preservative-free (PFD) or preserved (PD) dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops for two weeks after a standard phacoemulsification procedure. Fluorescein break-up time, ocular surface staining score, Schirmer test, Ocular Surface Disease Index and anterior chamber (AC) cells were evaluated at baseline prior to the surgery and 2 weeks after surgery. No statistically significant differences in baseline assessments were observed between groups. At week 2, a significant increase in corneal staining scores (p = 0.003) and foreign body sensation (p = 0.04) was observed for the PD group only. The conjunctival staining score was significantly higher in both groups. The mean AC cell grading was higher in the PFD group than in the PD group (0.28 \u00b1 0.30 and 0.07 \u00b1 0.18, respectively; p = 0.013). Preservative-free dexamethasone eye drops after cataract surgery caused milder dry eye symptoms as compared with preserved dexamethasone. The AC inflammation control comparison may require a larger study group. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05753787, 03/03/2023.\nDocument [6]: Title: A One-Week Course of Levofloxacin/Dexamethasone Eye Drops: A Review on a New Approach in Managing Patients After Cataract Surgery. Abstract: A new fixed-dose combination of dexamethasone and levofloxacin eye drops has recently been approved for the prevention and treatment of inflammation, and the prevention of infection associated with cataract surgery in adults. This combination has been developed to respond to a series of unmet needs in the practical management of patients undergoing cataract surgery. Namely, despite updated guidelines, many ophthalmologists employ protocols mainly based on their personal experience. As a result, the choice of drugs, treatment duration, and drug association is not evidence-based medicine (EBM)-oriented. In addition, antibiotic resistance may occur since antibiotics are used for an extended length of time, even with tapering. Corticosteroids are also prescribed for prolonged periods, frequently without follow-up. Therefore, patient adherence to postsurgical self-care is low, and mainly affects older patients who are the majority undergoing cataract surgery. In both rabbit and human trials, it has been demonstrated that both active ingredients penetrate the ocular system without pharmacokinetic interaction between the two. The concentrations of both ingredients in aqueous humor after their ocular instillation are high enough at the site of action to carry out their expected potent anti-inflammatory and antibiotic activity. Tested in a pivotal study aimed at investigating efficacy and safety of the intended indication, the mixture/compound was non-inferior to a 2-week treatment with dexamethasone/tobramycin in preventing or reducing inflammation and in preventing infection when administered for 1 week, followed by the administration of dexamethasone alone for another week. The outcomes obtained by this study suggest that a 1-week course of levofloxacin/dexamethasone eye drops is sufficient to resolve inflammation and prevent infection in patients undergoing cataract surgery. In addition, this study underlines that a follow-up visit after 1 week allows for a decision about whether to stop or continue a treatment in patients still experiencing symptoms or inflammation. In conclusion, this new dose combination could represent a turning point in managing patients after cataract surgery, while mostly avoiding antibiotic resistance and improving treatment adherence.\nDocument [7]: Title: USE OF OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY IN DETECTION OF CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA AFTER TREATMENT WITH NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS. Abstract: The aim of the study was to determine the correlation between implanted IOL material type to detect CME after NSAID use in cataract surgery. Study involved 94 eyes of 72 patients. Eyes were equally divided into two groups (n-47 in each). Post-operatively treatment regimen for participants from Group I included antibiotic and NSAID eye drops, while participants from group II were treated only with antibiotic eye drops. Acrylic hydrophobic intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in all patients comprising both groups. No patient developed cystoid macular edema from either group (CME). In both groups (with or without NSAID eye drops cover) mean central retinal thickness (CRT) was 230\u00b10.005 microns before the surgery. No statistically significant changes of CRT was noted in both groups (5\u00b1 0.09 microns ) (p<0.5). Study analysis has shown, that cystoid macular edema has not developed in patients, who underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery with hydrophobic IOL implantation, with or without NSAID eye drop cover. There was no statistically and clinically significant difference between the groups in terms of CRT. Implantation of acrylic hydrophobic intraocular lens(IOL) has shown to provide high uveal biocompatibility. Major risk factors of CME in cataract surgery are intraoperative surgical complications. Certain systemic and local ophthalmic diseases, as well as topical use of prostaglandin analogs are also strongly linked to postoperative CME development. In conclusion, usage of NSAID eye drops in combination with antibiotic regimen in eyes undergoing cataract surgery, showed to have a beneficial effect on prevention of postoperative CME.\nDocument [8]: Title: Effectiveness of 0.66% Povidone-Iodine Eye Drops on Ocular Surface Flora before Cataract Surgery: A Nationwide Microbiological Study. Abstract: A multicenter, nonrandomized, prospective, controlled study was conducted to evaluate, as perioperative prophylactic treatment, the anti-infective effectiveness of 0.66% povidone-iodine eye drops (IODIM<sup>&#174;</sup>) against the bacterial flora of the conjunctival surface of patients who undergo cataract surgery. Eye drops containing 0.66% povidone-iodine were applied to the eye undergoing cataract surgery; the untreated contralateral eye was used as control. One hundred and twenty patients set to receive unilateral cataract surgery were enrolled in 5 Italian Ophthalmology Centers and pretreated for three days with 0.66% povidone-iodine eye drops. The contralateral eye, used as control, was left untreated. Conjunctival swabs of both eyes were collected at the baseline visit and after three days of treatment, just before the cataract surgery. A qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of bacterial presence was evaluated by means of bacterial culture, followed by identification. Methicillin resistance determination was also performed on staphylococci isolates. Bacterial load before and after treatment of the eye candidate for cataract surgery was evaluated and compared to the untreated eye. A reduction or no regrowth on the culture media of the bacterial load was observed in 100% of the study subjects. A great heterogenicity of bacterial species was found. The 0.66% povidone-iodine eye drops, used for three days prior to cataract surgery, were effective in reducing the conjunctival bacterial load. The 0.66% povidone-iodine eye drops (IODIM<sup>&#174;</sup>) might represent a valid perioperative prophylactic antiseptic adjuvant treatment to protect the ocular surface from microbial contamination in preparation of the surgical procedure.\nDocument [9]: Title: Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine and D-Panthenol Eye Drops in Patients Undergoing Cataract Surgery. Abstract: Cataract surgery is widespread. The surgical procedure is associated with damage to the epithelial barrier and interruption of the corneal innervation. In addition, pathological events sustain signs and symptoms that may persist for a long time. Recently, a fixed combination of alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine and D-Panthenol (Oftassiale) has been available as eye drops. The present study investigated the effects of an Oftassiale therapy in 20 patients undergoing cataract surgery. A comparison group included 20 patients treated with topical hyaluronic acid. Standard prophylactic and anti-inflammatory treatment was prescribed to all patients. Clinical signs and symptoms were assessed over time. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed accordingly. Oftassiale treatment significantly reduced clinical features and improved IVCM outcomes. In addition, therapy was well-tolerated, and no clinically significant adverse events occurred. In conclusion, this study confirmed that IVCM helps assess the tunnel after cataract surgery due to its ability to provide microscopic details in vivo. Topical therapy with alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine and D-Panthenol eye drops promoted and stabilized the reepithelialization process. This fixed combination also accelerated and modulated the repair of the corneal innervation. Moreover, this treatment was well-tolerated and safe.\nDocument [10]: Title: Atropine eye-drop-induced acute delirium: a case report. Abstract: Atropine is an anticholinergic drug which is used in both parental and topical routes. Topical eye-drops of atropine sulfate are used as mydriatic and cycloplegics. Parental atropine-induced delirium is well known but topical atropine eye-drop-induced delirium cases are very limited in literature. In this case report, an elderly man underwent cataract surgery and developed delirium after the use of 1% atropine sulfate eye-drops as prescribed. This case supports the notion that even atropine eye-drops can cause delirium in patients at therapeutic doses in elderly.\nDocument [11]: Title: Disturbances in the ocular surface microbiome by perioperative antimicrobial eye drops. Abstract: We aimed to elucidate the effects of antimicrobial eye drops used in the perioperative period of ophthalmic surgery on the ocular surface microbiome by metagenomic analysis. Twenty-eight eyes from 15 patients (mean age 74.1 years) with no history of eye drop use within 3 months before cataract surgery were included in this study. Gatifloxacin eye drops were used in all patients in the perioperative period. The antimicrobial eye drops were started 3 days before surgery. They were discontinued after conjunctival sac specimen collection for 2 weeks after the surgery. Conjunctival sac specimens were collected to investigate the alterations in the ocular surface microbiome by meta-16S analysis targeting the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Principal coordinate analysis showed that the bacterial composition tended to be different before and 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. Individual observations on six eyes showed that the bacterial composition at 12 weeks after surgery was closer to that before surgery than to that at 4 weeks after surgery in two eyes, while the bacterial composition in the remaining four eyes was different at various time points. Before surgery, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were predominant; however, 2 weeks after surgery, the proportion of Proteobacteria increased and that of Firmicutes decreased. A similar trend was noticed 4 weeks after surgery, although antibacterial eye drops had been discontinued 2 weeks after surgery. The Shannon-Weaver coefficient showed a decreasing trend at 2-, 4-, and 12-weeks post operation compared to that before operation. The diversity of the microbiome decreased significantly at 2- and 4-weeks after surgery when compared to that before surgery (p < 0.05). The ocular surface microbiome is easily disrupted by antimicrobial eye drops, and it needs recovery time. In such cases, the ocular surface microbiome is presumed to contain many antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. In some cases, it may not recover, and a new microbiome is formed.\nDocument [12]: Title: Cystoid macular edema following photorefractive keratectomy complicated by presumptive infectious keratitis. Abstract: A 71-year-old man developed cystoid macular edema (CME) following photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). He had a history of CME following cataract surgery in both eyes, which had responded well to topical steroid and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drops. The cataract surgery in the left eye had resulted in a hyperopic surprise, with secondary anisometropia and visual discomfort. For this reason, the patient elected to have PRK. Three weeks after the procedure, he returned, complaining of visual loss. Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography confirmed the presence of CME. This responded well to topical and sub-Tenon's corticosteroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drops.\nDocument [13]: Title: Clinical efficacy of diquafosol sodium 3% versus hyaluronic acid 0.1% in patients with dry eye disease after cataract surgery: a protocol for a single-centre, randomised controlled trial. Abstract: The number of cataract surgeries, the most common ophthalmic surgery, is expected to increase due to ageing populations. Dry eye disease (DED) is a frequent side effect of cataract surgery, contributing to lower postoperative patient satisfaction and suboptimal quality of vision. It is unclear which eye-drops commonly used in these patients should be recommended for postoperative DED treatment. This study aims to compare the efficacy of topical administration of diquafosol sodium 3% vs hyaluronic acid 0.1% eye-drops in patients with DED after cataract surgery.\nDocument [14]: Title: N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) drops for age-related cataract. Abstract: Cataract is the leading cause of world blindness. The only available treatment for cataract is surgery. Surgery requires highly-trained individuals with expensive operating facilities. Where these are not available, patients go untreated. A form of treatment that did not involve surgery would be a useful alternative for people with symptomatic cataract who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery. If an eye drop existed that could reverse or even prevent progression of cataract, then this would be a useful additional treatment option.Cataract tends to result from oxidative stress. The protein, L-carnosine, is known to have an antioxidant effect on the cataractous lens, so biochemically there is sound logic for exploring L-carnosine as an agent to reverse or even prevent progression of cataract. When applied as an eye drop, L-carnosine cannot penetrate the eye. However, when applied to the surface of the eye, N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) penetrates the cornea into the front chamber of the eye (near to where the cataract is), where it is metabolised into L-carnosine. Hence, it is possible that use of NAC eye drops may reverse or even prevent progression of cataract, thereby improving vision and quality of life.\nDocument [15]: Title: Iris Atrophy After Administration of Intracameral Dexycu in Routine Cataract Surgery: A Case Series. Abstract: Dexycu (Icon Bioscience INC, Newark, CA) is an FDA-approved single-dose, sustained release intracameral steroid designed to mitigate postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery as an alternative to topical steroid therapy. The purpose of this study was to look at long-term and adverse events associated with Dexycu use. Eighteen eyes from nine patients who underwent cataract surgery were included. Patients were followed for an average of 97 days (range 28-319 days) after surgery on the first eye. Thirteen eyes were treated with Dexycu, and the other five eyes were treated with standard postoperative anti-inflammatory drops. Four of the thirteen eyes receiving Dexycu developed clinically evident iris atrophy (30.7%). None of the five eyes treated with traditional anti-inflammatory drops developed iris atrophy. The Dexycu intraocular dexamethasone implant was designed to mitigate postoperative inflammation and reduce need for topical therapy but may be associated with other potential adverse effects that warrant consideration.\nDocument [16]: Title: Effects of Pranoprofen on Aqueous Humor Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 Level and Pain Relief During Second-Eye Cataract Surgery. Abstract: The aim of our present study is to evaluate the efficacy of pranoprofen eye drops as pain relief during sequential second-eye cataract surgery and to investigate the possible mechanism. Seventy-six patients scheduled for bilateral sequential cataract surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) treatment group (administered pranoprofen eye drops), or (2) control group (administered artificial tears). Preoperative anxiety and intraoperative pain were assessed. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in the aqueous humor was measured with a suspension cytokine array. An extracapsular lens extraction model was established in the Wistar rat and the MCP-1 concentrations were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that in the control group, the pain scores were significantly higher during second-eye surgery than during first-eye surgery (both scores <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). In the treatment group, there was no significant difference in the pain scores during first-eye and second-eye surgery (both scores <i>P</i> &gt; 0.1). The pain during second-eye surgery was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (both scores <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). And in the 1-week and 6-week interval subgroups, the pain scores during second-eye surgery were significantly lower in the treatment group than the control group (<i>P</i> = 0.047 and <i>P</i> = 0.035, respectively). While the second-eye MCP-1 level was significantly lower after a 1-week interval in the treatment group than in the control group (<i>P</i> = 0.012), but did not differ significantly after a 6-week interval (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.1). A parallel trend in the MCP-1 concentration was detected in the rat model. In conclusion, the preoperative administration of pranoprofen eye drops reduced the perceived pain during second-eye cataract surgery, especially when performed after 1-week and 6-week intervals between the first-eye and second-eye surgery. MCP-1, a pain-related cytokine, was associated with the pain-relief mechanism of pranoprofen when second-eye surgery was performed 1 week after second-eye surgery.\nDocument [17]: Title: Management of Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage during Cataract Surgery: A Case Report. Abstract: A 61-year-old patient with end-stage liver cirrhosis was admitted for cataract surgery with corrected distance visual acuities (CDVAs) of 0.3, in both eyes. His international correction ratio (INR) for blood coagulation was 2.1 without any anticoagulants, and general anesthesia was contraindicated. He was deemed inoperable for liver transplantation. Two weeks after uneventful phacoemulsification in his right eye under topical anesthesia, he underwent phacoemulsification for the cataract in the left eye. However, during surgery, extensive zonular dialysis was noted and the surgery proceeded with extracapsular cataract extraction and anterior vitrectomy, during which a rapid suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) was noted. The incisions were then rapidly sutured. Intravenous 150 cc of 18% mannitol and 2 mg midazolam and sublingual 5 drops of nifedipine were given, and he was placed in the slightly reverse-trendelenburg position. Following suturation of the incision, the globe was left aphakic, slightly hypertonic with no loss of vitreous through the incisions. The postoperative treatment regimen of topical prednisolone and moxifloxacin eye drops of each per hour, cyclopentolate three times a day, and peroral prednisolone 40 mg was commenced. Despite no retinal reflex on the first day and no light perception for 2 weeks, transscleral SCH evacuation with limited pars plana vitrectomy was performed in the postoperative third week. Despite recurrent hemorrhage and intravitreal inflammatory bands, choroidal detachments regressed slowly with the improvement of CDVA up to 0.6 with aphakic contact lens correction at 3 months. The patient passed away due to complications of liver cirrhosis at 6 months.\nDocument [18]: Title: Mydrane intracameral injection site can be an alternative to mydriatic drops instillation in cataract surgery. Abstract: The aim of this study is to compare Mydrane (combination of tropicamide 0.02%, phenylephrine 0.31% and lidocaine 1%) and mydriatic drops (tropicamide 1% and phenylephrine 10%) used for cataract surgery in terms of efficacy in pupil dilation and impact on corneal endothelial cell density (CD) and central corneal thickness (CCT). Prospective study including 64 eyes of 64 patients that underwent phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation. Patients were randomized into two groups: Mydrane group received: tropicamide and phenylephrine one day preoperatively and Mydrane during the surgery. Reference group received: tropicamide and phenylephrine preoperatively. Pupil size was measured only in Mydrane group, in the same eye of the same patient one day preoperatively after mydriatic drops were given and during the surgery, after intracameral Mydrane injection. CD and CCT were evaluated one day preoperatively and one month postoperatively in all patients and compared between Mydrane and reference groups. The results show CCT and CD significantly decreased after surgery in both groups. There is no difference in this decrease between groups. In Mydrane group there was no difference in dilated pupil diameter between Mydrane and mydriatic drops. Gender, diabetes mellitus, POAG, alpha-1 blocker treatment failed to affect pupil dilation obtained with Mydrane. Cataract surgery affects CCT and CD regardless of which mydriatic protocol had been used. Pupil diameter was similar after drops instillation and after Mydrane injection in all patients from the Mydrane group.\nDocument [19]: Title: Diclofenac sodium and prednisolone acetate ophthalmic solution in controlling inflammation after cataract surgery. Abstract: Cataract is the leading cause of blindness throughout the world. This prospective study was conducted in the department of ophthalmology, Mymensingh Medical college Hospital. Patients of both sexes of 45 to 70 years of age range admitted for cataract surgery were selected for this study. Patients were randomly selected during the period June 2007 to December 2008 with age related cataract. Total 80 patients were included in the study dividing into two groups. In Group-A, 40 patients were treated with diclofenac sodium 0.1% eye drop -1 drop 4 times daily for 30 days after cataract surgery. In Group-B 40 patients were treated with prednisolone acetate 1% eye drop-1 drop-2 hourly 1 week, 1 drop 4 hourly for 2 weeks than 1 drop 6 hourly for 30 days after cataract surgery. Male were 70% and female were 30% in both groups A & B. Post operative inflammation were evaluated by slit lamp examination of cells, flares & keratic precipitate (KP). Patients were evaluated on 1st, 7th and 30th postoperative day. Anterior chamber cells were found 10% in grade-I, 45% in grade-II, 45% in grade-III of group-A and 15% in grade-I, 40% in grade-II, 45% in grade-III patients of group-B in 1st visit. Anterior chamber cells reduce in 2nd visit & in final visit anterior chamber cells were absent in 90% patients in group-A & 92.5% patients in group-B. Anterior chamber flares were found in 32.5% in grade-I, 42.5% in grade-II, 25% patients in grade-III of group-A & 32.5% in grade-I, 47.5% in grade-II, 20% in grade-III of group-B in 1st visit. Anterior chamber flares reduce in both groups in 2nd visit. In final visit anterior chamber flares absent 90% patients in group-A & 90% patients in group-B. KP were found 17.5% patients in grade-I of group-A & 20% patients in grade-I of group-B. In 2nd visit KP reduced in both groups & in final visit KP were absent in 95% patients of group-A & 95% patients of group-B. Analysis shows no significant difference in cells, flares and KP in both groups. Visual acuity with pin hole at final visit- in group-A 5% had 6/18, 10% had 6/12, 50% had 6/9, 35% had 6/6 and in group-B 5% had 6/18, 5% had 6/12, 57.5% had 6/9 and 32.5% had 6/6. Visual outcome were good in both the groups. No statistical significant difference was found between two groups. At each visit there was no statistically significant difference of post operative inflammation between two groups of patients.\nDocument [20]: Title: Lenticular myopia from oil-drop cataract: a cautionary note in laser in situ keratomileusis. Abstract: We present 5 patients with oil-drop cataracts in whom the underlying lenticular cause of myopic regression after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) had been missed by their ophthalmologists. As a result, the patients were scheduled for or had had LASIK enhancement before presentation to us. After oil-drop cataracts were diagnosed, phacoemulsification was performed successfully in at least 1 eye of all patients. These cases underscore the importance of considering lens-induced myopia in refractive surgery patients, especially those with an unstable preoperative refraction or postoperative myopic regression. Refractive surgery in these cases can unnecessarily complicate the measurement of intraocular lens strength in cataract surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Results from a meta-analysis. Abstract: The magnitude of the association of factor V Leiden mutation with pregnancy-related venous thrombosis remains unclear. Our objective was to undertake a systematic review and a metaanalysis of the literature to estimate precisely the association of factorV Leiden mutation with the risk of first, or recurrent, pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism. Studies published before October 2005 were identified by Medline((R)). Using both fixed and random effect models, odds ratios (OR) with accompanying 95% confidential intervals (CI) were calculated for the factor V Leiden mutation and the clinical end-point (Yusuf-Peto adaptation of the Mantel-Haenszel, DerSimonian and Laird method). We identified 13 studies including 7 cohorts and 6 casecontrol studies relating to factor V Leiden and pregnancy-related venous thrombosis. The results from the cohorts showed a pooled OR of 4.46 (95% CI, 1.82-10.94; 7,879 pooled women), with no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (p = 0.36), for the risk of a first venous thromboembolism during pregnancy or the postpartum period associated with the factor V Leiden mutation. Case-control studies revealed a higher risk (OR 8.6, 95% CI, 5.85-12.63; 1,433 [corrected] pooled women) with significant heterogeneity (p < 0.005). Because of insufficient data, an analysis for the risk of recurrence could not be performed. Our findings emphasize the fact that limited data are available on this topic. This meta-analysis provides clinicians with an estimate of the average risk of a first thrombosis occurring during pregnancy in women carrying the factor V Leiden to assist the management of such women.\nDocument [2]: Title: Factor V Leiden in women: a thrombotic risk factor or an evolutionary advantage? Abstract: Factor V Leiden is a common gain-of-function gene mutation resulting in a genetic predisposition to thromboembolic complications. Growing evidence in the literature indicates an interaction between factor V Leiden thrombophilia and acquired prothrombotic conditions such as contraceptive use or hormone replacement therapy, resulting in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Similarly, when combined with the prothrombotic influence of pregnancy, women who are carriers of factor V Leiden are faced with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including VTE, pre-eclampsia, fetal loss, placental abruption, and fetal growth restriction. The results of the most important meta-analyses on the relationship between inherited (factor V Leiden) and acquired thrombophilia in women are analyzed in this review, along with the possible evolutionary role of this mutation.\nDocument [3]: Title: The association of factor V G1961A (factor V Leiden), prothrombin G20210A, MTHFR C677T and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms with recurrent pregnancy loss in Bosnian women. Abstract: Aim To investigate association of factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, MTHFR C677T and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms with recurrent pregnancy loss in Bosnian women. Methods A total of 60 women with two or more consecutive miscarriages before 20 weeks of gestation with the same partners and without history of known causes or recurrent pregnancy loss were included. A control group included 80 healthy women who had one or more successful pregnancies without history of any complication which could be associated with miscarriages. Genotyping of factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, MTHFR C677T and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms were performed by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragments length polymorphism method (PCR/RFLP). Results Both factor V Leiden and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were significantly associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) in Bosnian women while prothrombin G20210A and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms did not show strongly significant association. Conclusion The presence of thrombophilic polymorphisms may predispose women to recurrent pregnancy loss. Future investigation should be addressed in order to find when carriers of those mutations, polymorphisms should be treated with anticoagulant therapy.\nDocument [4]: Title: Factor V Leiden: association with venous thromboembolism in pregnancy and screening issues. Abstract: Disturbances of the natural balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms can result in bleeding or thrombotic tendencies. Factor V, on activation by thrombin to factor Va, forms an essential component of the prothrombinase complex, in which it demonstrates its cofactor activity for factor Xa. Down-regulation of factor Va by activated protein C (APC) occurs through cleavage of specific peptide bonds in the heavy chain of the molecule. Factor V Leiden (FV Leiden) is a mutation of factor V that renders factor Va resistant to APC, due to loss of one of these cleavage sites. This mutation predisposes the patient to thrombosis. Prevalence of FV Leiden varies; however, heterozygosity for the FV Leiden mutation is recognised as the most common heritable thrombophilic defect in Caucasian populations. The association this inherited thrombophilia has with venous thromboembolism (VTE) is well established. Pregnancy is notably an acquired hypercoagulable state, due in part to physiological changes that occur in the coagulation system. This seems to have potential for interaction with FV Leiden to cause adverse experiences. A role has been suggested for FV Leiden in VTE events during pregnancy. At present only selected women are screened for FV Leiden. Pregnant women with a history of VTE or with a family history of the mutation are investigated. Whether or not the introduction of a routine screening plan for this mutation is justified remains a matter for debate.\nDocument [5]: Title: Thrombophilias and recurrent pregnancy loss. Abstract: Thrombophilia by definition represents acquired and/or genetic conditions that predispose patients to both venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Thrombosis is the most common cause of death worldwide. On the arterial side, myocardial infarction and stroke result in significant morbidity and mortality. Venous thromboembolic events most commonly involve the deep veins of the lower extremity with potential complications of pulmonary emboli. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, and thromboembolism is the leading cause of antepartum and postpartum maternal mortality. With the description by Dahlback in 1993 of a condition initially labeled activated protein C resistance, significant advances have rapidly followed. Activated protein C resistance was linked to an underlying point mutation resulting in coagulation factor V (factor V Leiden). Recent attention has focused on certain inherited thrombophilic factors that may predispose to arterial and/or venous thromboses and their possible association with pregnancy complications, including early pregnancy loss. These include a group of mostly autosomal dominant, inherited gene mutations leading to a hypercoagulable state, such as factor V Leiden G1691A, factor II or prothrombin G20210A, and hyperhomocysteinemia associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation. In addition, deficiencies in protein S, protein C, and antithrombin can lead to a hypercoagulable state. Although some studies of recurrent pregnancy loss patients with a positive test for an inherited thrombophilia are conflicting, a case-control study of untreated recurrent miscarriage patients who were heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation revealed a lower success rate than the controls who had a history of idiopathic recurrent miscarriage. With the identification of genetic risk factors, there has been synergistic amplification of thrombotic risk when one has an abnormal gene (e.g., factor V Leiden) plus environmental issues (e.g., pregnancy). Current understanding indicates that a combination of risk factors, including multiple inherited thrombophilic defects associated with secondary hypercoagulable states, have a particularly strong association with adverse pregnancy outcome.\nDocument [6]: Title: Association between factor V Leiden mutation and poor pregnancy outcomes among Palestinian women. Abstract: Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state with increased tendency for thrombus formation, a condition that is increased when combined with acquired or inherited risk factors that lead to thrombophilia. Among the inherited risk factors is Factor V Leiden mutation, an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. The mutation seems to be associated with different poor pregnancy outcomes including recurrent miscarriages. In the present study, we performed a case-control study to investigate the association between the Leiden mutation and poor pregnancy outcome among the Palestinian population in the West bank region of Palestine. The study included 145 subjects with recurrent miscarriages and 205 matched control subjects with successful pregnancies who experienced normal delivery and no apparent complications. Leiden mutation was detected in 41 of the 145 study subjects (28.2%), and in 24 of the 205 control subjects (11.7%). Subjects homozygous with the mutant allele were identified only among the test and not the control group. Data analysis indicates a significant association between the mutant allele and recurrent miscarriages (p-value<0.05). Furthermore, this association is significant between the mutant haplotype with miscarriages compared to control group showing time effect where there is no association for miscarriages before week 10. Results here also show strong association of factor V leiden polymorphism among primary aborters compared to secondary aborters or control groups. The odds ratio for the primary aborters was 75 and p<0.0001. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for a significant correlation between recurrent miscarriages and Factor V mutation in our population.\nDocument [7]: Title: HELLP Syndrome and Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Associated with Factor V Leiden Mutation during Pregnancy. Abstract: Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. The neurological complications of preeclampsia and eclampsia are responsible for a major proportion of the morbidity and mortality for women and their infants alike. Hormonal changes during pregnancy and the puerperium carry an increased risk of venous thromboembolism including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Factor 5 leiden (FVL) is a procoagulant mutation associated primarily with venous thrombosis and pregnancy complications. We report a patient with FVL mutation who presented with CVST at 24th week of pregnancy and was diagnosed as HELLP syndrome at 34th week of pregnancy.\nDocument [8]: Title: Pregnancy-related thrombosis risk in patients with protein C deficiency and comparison with pregnant women with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Abstract: : The risk of pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism is high in patients with inherited thrombophilia. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of pregnancy related-venous thromboembolism of women with protein C (PC) deficiency to patients with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. 145 consecutive pregnant women with confirmed PC deficiency or heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation were prospectively enrolled in the study. Lyon venous thromboembolism-risk score was used to individually tailor antithrombotic prophylaxis. The use of a validated clinical score presents the advantage to have a homogenous management of the venous thromboembolism risk in patients having similar risk factors. 53 pregnancies with PC deficiency were compared with 190 pregnancies in heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation carriers. 50% of the patients with PC deficiency and 64% of the heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation carriers were asymptomatic. According to the Lyon-venous thromboembolism risk score, 50% of patients with PC deficiency and 51% of heterozygous factor V Leiden carriers did not received any antepartum heparin prophylaxis. 34 and 37% of patients respectively received heparin prophylaxis during the third trimester only. No venous thromboembolism was observed in patients with PC deficiency and one postpartum venous thromboembolism occurred in a patient with heterozygous factor V Leiden. In the absence of randomized controlled clinical studies, we report here a large prospective series of pregnant women with PC deficiency. In our cohort, no difference of outcome, in terms of venous thromboembolism, was observed between pregnant women with PC deficiency and those with heterozygous factor V Leiden. Based on our results, low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis should not be mandatory in all pregnant women with PC deficiency. Similar prophylaxis strategies may be applied to women with factor V Leiden mutation or PC deficiency.\nDocument [9]: Title: Association between adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal factor V G1691A (Leiden) and prothrombin G20210A genotypes in women with a history of recurrent idiopathic miscarriages. Abstract: Thrombophilia was implicated in the development of pregnancy complications, including recurrent idiopathic pregnancy loss, and is aggravated in women who are carriers of factor V G1691A (FV Leiden) and prothrombin (PRT) G20210A single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Previous studies examined the role of FV-Leiden and PRT G20210A in recurrent pregnancy loss with conflicting results. Here we examined the prevalence of FV Leiden and PRT G20210A SNPs, in 200 women with 3 or more consecutive early (n = 87), late (n = 41), or early-late (n = 72) recurrent pregnancy losses, and 200 age-matched fertile parous control women. APC resistance (APCR) was detected functionally (measuring the activated clotting time triggered by activated factor X in presence of a fixed amount of purified APC), and FV-Leiden and PRT G20210A genotypes were assessed by PCR. The frequency of the mutant FV (0.1400 vs. 0.0276; P < 0.001) but not PRT 20210 (0.0100 vs. 0.0225; P = 0.159) allele was higher in patients than controls, respectively. APC resistance with factor V Leiden was seen in 27% of patients compared to 11.5% of controls, while APC resistance without factor V Leiden was seen in 12.5% of patients compared to 9.5% of controls. Regression analysis demonstrated that the significant predictors for early abortion was FV Leiden; those for late abortion were oral contraceptive, APCR, and FV Leiden; and predictors for early-late abortions were oral contraceptives, obesity, FV Leiden, and smoking. APC resistance and FV Leiden, as well as combination of both, are common thrombotic defects seen in women with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss, thus testing for these is recommended in women who have experienced recurrent miscarriages.\nDocument [10]: Title: [Analgesia for childbirth in a patient with factor V Leiden mutation]. Abstract: Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common congenital thrombophilic disorder, affecting between 5% and 8% of the Caucasian population. Pregnancy creates a state of hypercoagulability and all factors that increase the risk of thrombosis should be considered, as they may be cumulative. In recent years, the diagnosis of new allelic variants of thrombophilic states have increased the incidence of pregnant women receiving anticoagulant therapy, with the anesthetic considerations that implies. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with heterozygous Leiden factor V mutation who was admitted with spontaneous amniorrhexis in the 38th week of gestation. She was taking low molecular weight heparin therapy. An epidural catheter was inserted to provide analgesia for labor, with all safety precautions to prevent an epidural hematoma. Epidural anesthesia is the technique of choice for obstetric labor in patients with hypercoagulability because of its effects of favoring blood flow and inhibiting clot formation.\nDocument [11]: Title: Association of factor V gene polymorphisms (Leiden; Cambridge; Hong Kong and HR2 haplotype) with recurrent idiopathic pregnancy loss in Tunisia. A case-control study. Abstract: Inherited thrombophilia has been shown to be linked with fetal loss. We performed a case-control study on the association between thrombosis-related polymorphisms in the factor V (FV) gene (Leiden, Cambridge, Hong Kong; HR2 haplotype) and idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) in Tunisian women. A total of 348 women with RPL, and 203 control women were studied, corresponding to 1,250 pregnancy losses and 1,200 successful pregnancies. FV Leiden was seen in 19.4% of patients (4.3% in the homozygous state) and in 5.5% of controls. The prevalence of the FV HR2 haplotype was similar in patients and controls, but with 7 homozygous patients for 1 control. FV Cambridge and Hong Kong were absent from both patients and controls. The study of all pregnancy losses evidenced that the frequency of the factor V Leiden polymorphism was zero in women who had mis-carried before 7 weeks of gestation, and then sharply increased to a plateau. After categorization of pregnancy losses (before 8 weeks of gestation; weeks 8 and 9; weeks 10 to 12; from the 13th week of gestation onwards), heterozygous and homozygous factor V Leiden polymorphisms, and homozygous FV HR2 haplotype, were associated with significant and independent risks of pregnancy loss during weeks 8 and 9, which increased during weeks 10 to 12, then culminated after week 12. In Tunisian women with idiopathic RPL, factor V Leiden polymorphism and homozygous FV HR2 haplotype are not a risk factor for very early pregnancy loss, before 8 weeks of gestation, but are thereafter associated with significant clinical risks, which gradually increase from the 8th week onwards.\nDocument [12]: Title: [Pregnancy-associated venous thrombosis in women with hereditary heterozygous factor V Leiden and/or factor II gene mutations]. Abstract: The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnant women with heterozygous factor V Leiden and/or heterozygous factor II 20210A gene mutations is poorly documented, and the need for prophylaxis is therefore controversial. We retrospectively studied 208 women with hereditary thrombophilia (heterozygous FV Leiden and/or factor II gene mutations), who had a total of 406 full-term pregnancies, including 10 with thromboprophylaxis. The ante- and post-partum incidence of VTE was significantly higher in women with both mutations (17.8 %) than in women with FII gene mutation alone (6.2%) p = 0.003. In contrast, there was no significant difference between women with FV+FII mutation and those with FV mutations alone (10%). Thus, the two most common hereditary risk factors for thrombophilia seem to have an additive rather than a synergistic effect on the antepartum/post-partum risk of VTE. In contrast, a previous history of VTE before pregnancy in women with both the FV and the FII gene mutations was associated with a very high risk of VTE (50%). The incidence of VTE was higher during the post-partum period than the ante-partum period. There was no significant difference in the incidence of fetal loss in the three groups, but this was not a primary endpoint. These results, obtained in a single center, have implications for VTE prophylaxis. Routine use of LMWH is not indicated during pregnancy in asymptomatic women with a single mutation. In contrast, it is justified throughout pregnancy in women with both mutations and a history of venous thrombosis. Regarding asymptomatic women with both mutations, the need for prophylaxis during part or all of the pregnancy should be weighed up on an individual basis. In the post-partum period, there is a consensus on the use of LMWH for 6 weeks in women with single or dual mutations associated with thrombophilia.\nDocument [13]: Title: Mesenteric vein thrombosis in a pregnant patient heterozygous for the factor V (1691 G --> A) Leiden mutation. Abstract: Factor V Leiden mutation is a risk factor for the development of thromboembolic events in pregnancy. Thrombosis of the mesenteric vein is a fairly infrequent condition complicating pregnancy. In this paper, we described a pregnant patient with mesenteric vein thrombosis who was heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation.\nDocument [14]: Title: Therapeutic Options in Pregnant Women with Thrombophilia Depending on the Genetic Mutations- a Prospective Study. Abstract: The aim is to evaluate the effects of anticoagulant therapy (Enoxaparine) compared to antiaggregant therapy (Aspirin) on pregnancy outcome depending on the mutational status of clotting factors. The study was conducted prospectively over a 2 years period and included 110 pregnant women, of whom 80 patients diagnosed with hereditary thrombophilia and 30 healthy pregnant women, representing the control group. After careful observation, we concluded a positive influence of Enoxaparine on pregnancy outcome in pregnant women homozygous carriers for factor V Leiden gene mutation and compound heterozygous for Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin G20210A gene mutation. The study did not find significant positive results in women with heterozygous Factor V Leiden and G20210A prothrombin gene mutation who received anticoagulant therapy as well as pregnant women who received low-dose Aspirin compared with controls.\nDocument [15]: Title: The association between adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal factor V Leiden genotype: a meta-analysis. Abstract: The conclusions of studies to date which evaluate a possible association between factor V Leiden and adverse pregnancy outcome have been conflicting. This study was undertaken to further investigate this association. Our objective was to evaluate the association between adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal factor V Leiden genotype by meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria were: (a) cohort or case control design; (b) outcomes clearly defined as one of the following: first or second/ third trimester miscarriage or intrauterine death, preeclampsia, fetal growth retardation, or placental abruption; (c) both the case and control mothers tested for the factor V Leiden mutation; (d) sufficient data for calculation of an odds ratio. Both fixed and random effect models were used to pool results and heterogeneity and publication bias were checked. For first trimester fetal loss, the pooled odds ratio was heterogeneous (p=0.06) and no dose-response curve could be found. For second/third trimester fetal loss, there was a consistent and graded increase in risk: the odds ratio was 2.4 (95% CI 1.1-5.2) for isolated (non-recurrent) third trimester fetal loss, rising to 10.7 (95% CI 4.0-28.5) for those with 2 or more second/third trimester fetal losses. Factor V Leiden is associated with a 2.9 fold (95% CI 2.0-4.3) increased risk of severe preeclampsia, and a 4.8 fold (95% CI 2.4-9.4) increased risk of fetal growth retardation. These results support factor V Leiden testing for women with recurrent fetal loss in the second/third trimester. Women with only 1 event may also warrant testing if the fetal loss occurred in the third trimester. Conversely, in those women known to have the factor V Leiden mutation, monitoring for adverse pregnancy outcomes is warranted; whether this means increased vigilance or anti-coagulant prophylaxis is still contentious.\nDocument [16]: Title: Ramifications of four concurrent thrombophilic mutations and one hypofibrinolytic mutation. Abstract: A kindred was examined in which the 48-year-old white female proband with three deep venous thrombosis-pulmonary emboli events had four thrombophilic and one hypofibrinolytic mutations, and in which her 14-year-old asymptomatic daughter had four thrombophilic mutations. The proband was heterozygous for the G1691A factor V Leiden, G20210A prothrombin, and platelet glycoprotein IIIa PL A1/A2 mutations, had high factor VIII (221%), and was homozygous for the 4G4G plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene mutation, with high plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (23.7 U/mL). Her 14-year-old daughter was homozygous for the G1691A factor V Leiden and platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa PL A2/A2 mutations, compound heterozygous for the C677T and A1298C methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutations, and heterozygous for the G20210A prothrombin mutation, a combination with an estimated likelihood of 1.6 x 10(-7). In 247 white healthy controls, there was no V Leiden homozygosity and no V Leiden-prothrombin gene compound heterozygosity. Heterozygosity for the V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations was 3.2% and 4.1%, respectively. Homozygosity for the platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa PL A2A2, PAI-1 gene 4G4G, and C677T MTHFR mutations was 3.2%, 22.7%, and 12%, respectively. The proband will receive anticoagulation therapy for life. Beyond aspirin, avoidance of exogenous estrogens, and enoxaparin prophylaxis during pregnancy, it is not known whether the proband's daughter should have lifelong anticoagulation therapy, or only after her first thrombotic event.\nDocument [17]: Title: Risk factors for clinical manifestations in carriers of Factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations. Abstract: Carriers of Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations have an increased risk of developing thromboembolic events and adverse outcomes of pregnancy. The objective of the present study was to identify risk factors which may predispose carriers of Factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A gene mutations to develop thromboembolic events and adverse outcomes of pregnancy. A retrospective case-control study of 217 carriers of Factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A gene mutations at two tertiary centers between January 2000 and December 2006. Symptomatic carriers (cases) were compared with asymptomatic carriers (controls) for the following risk factors: environmental, cardiovascular, family history of thrombosis, and presence of other thrombophilias. For female carriers, we included the use of female hormones, pregnancy, and the postpartum period. Of the 217 carriers, there were 155 (71%) cases and 62 (29%) controls. Of the 155 cases, 90 (58%) had venous thrombosis and 26 (17%) arterial thrombosis. Among the 123 symptomatic female carriers, 55 (45%) had recurrent pregnancy losses and nine (7%) other adverse outcomes of pregnancy. The postoperative state and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies were risk factors for thromboembolic events and adverse outcomes of pregnancy in 10 (6%) and 22 (13%) cases, respectively. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in symptomatic carriers increased the risk of developing thromboembolic events 4.4-fold. The postoperative state and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies were significant risk factors for thromboembolic events and adverse outcomes of pregnancy among Factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A gene mutation carriers. Testing for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies may be warranted in Factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A gene mutation carriers who develop these adverse clinical manifestations.\nDocument [18]: Title: Factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene G20210A mutation and in vitro fertilization: prospective cohort study. Abstract: The influence of thrombophilia on fertility and on IVF outcome is very controversial. The objectives of this study were: (i) to compare the prevalence of Factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin gene G20210A mutation (PGM) in women undergoing IVF to women with spontaneous pregnancy; (ii) to compare the IVF outcomes and the risk of complications in FVL and PGM carrier to non-carrier women.\nDocument [19]: Title: Activated protein C resistance and antiphospholipid antibodies in recurrent fetal loss: experience of a single referral center in northern iraq. Abstract: The current study was initiated to determine the prevalence of activated protein C (APC) resistance, factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) in Iraqi women with recurrent fetal loss (RFL), and evaluate the outcome of intervention in those with such states. For this purpose a total of 103 Iraqi women referred to a major teaching hospital in Northern Iraq with two or more consecutive fetal losses, as well as 100 age matched women with no history of fetal loss and at least one live birth were enrolled. After appropriate clinical evaluation, the enrolled subjects were tested for APA as well as APC resistance. Subjects who were APC resistant were further tested for factor V Leiden mutation using a polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization. Patients with documented APA and/or with APC resistance, were put on low dose aspirin with or without low molecular weight heparin during pregnancy, and followed for a minimum of 5 years. The results revealed that among patients' group, APA were detected in 19.4 % compared to 1.0 % of the controls (OR 23.9, p = 0.00005). On the other hand, APC resistance was documented in 9.7 % compared to 1.0 % of the controls (OR 10.6, p = 0.01). Factor V Leiden was detected in 3.9 % of patients and 1 % of the controls (p = 0.38). Among 17 patients with APA available for follow up, there were 24 pregnancies, 18 of which ended with live births (75 %). While among the ten patients who had factor V Leiden or were APC resistant non-carriers, there were 13 pregnancies, 12 ended with live births (92.3 %). In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that among the enrolled Iraqi women, APA and APCR and not factor V Leiden were significantly associated with RFL, and that treatment with aspirin (with or without low molecular weight heparin) had lead to live births in 80.6 % of pregnancies.\nDocument [20]: Title: Venous thromboembolism during pregnancy is not associated with persistent elevated activated protein C (APC) sensitivity ratio based on the endogenous thrombin potential. Abstract: Women who are using oral contraceptives can acquire APC resistance, measured by the effect of APC on the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). The objective of our study was to examine whether persistentAPC resistance determined with an ETP-based normalized APC sensitivity ratio (nAPCsr) is a risk marker for venous thromboembolism in women with pregnancy-associated thromboembolism. We determined the activities of antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and performed a genetic analysis of factor V Leiden G1691A, prothrombin mutation G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation (MTHFR C677T) in 65 women with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy or the puerperium and in 114 normal women. A significantly (p<0.05) higher nAPCsr was present in normal women using hormones, in younger women (<or=45 yrs), and in women with carrier status of factorV Leiden. In normal women without factor V Leiden a significant (p<0.05) negative correlation of nAPCsr with age (r=-0.39), antithrombin activity (r=-0.38), protein S activity (r=-0.26), and a significant positive correlation with hormone intake (r=0.36) was present. nAPCsr is influenced by several coagulation parameters, which are modified by the use of oral contraceptives. Consequently, a multivariate analysis of our data did not show a significant association of nAPCsr to venous thromboembolism, neither as a continuous variable (odds ratio 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.1, p=0.10) nor using a cutoff value (nAPCsr cut-off 3.1: odds ratio 1.2, 95% CI 0.3-5.3, p=0.77). Our study demonstrates that nAPCsr is not a risk marker for pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Isoniazid (INH) monotherapy has gained widespread acceptance as an efficacious therapy for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) especially in low-prevalence settings. Although INH related hepatotoxicity is well recognized, progression to severe liver dysfunction requiring care at a transplant center remains unpredictable. We report the management of a five year-old girl who developed progressive liver failure due to INH prophylaxis. This highlights the potential severity of INH related hepatic injury and underscores the significance of vigilant clinical monitoring throughout the duration of the therapy in children.\nDocument [2]: Title: Association between 9-month isoniazid prophylaxis of latent tuberculosis and severe hepatitis in patients treated with TNF inhibitors. Abstract: To investigate associations between isoniazid for latent tuberculosis and risk of severe hepatitis, affecting patients with rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis whose treatment includes tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Our self-controlled case series study analyzed Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database from 2003 to 2015 to identify RA or AS patients, aged \u2265 20 years, receiving TNF inhibitors and a 9-month single isoniazid treatment. The outcome of interest was hospitalization due to severe hepatitis. We defined risk periods by isoniazid exposure (days): 1-28, 29-56, 57-84, 85-168, 169-252, and 253-280. To compare risk of severe hepatitis in exposed and non-exposed periods, we performed conditional Poisson regressions to generate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals, with adjustment of patients' baseline covariates including age, sex, HBV, HCV and related medication. Of 54,267 RA patients and 137,889 AS patients identified between 2000 and 2015, 11,221 (20.7%) RA and 4,208 (3.1%) AS patients underwent TNFi therapy, with 722 (5%) receiving isoniazid for latent tuberculosis. We identified 31 incident cases (4.3%) of hospitalization due to severe hepatitis. Of these hospitalization events, 5 occurred in the exposed periods, 25 occurred in the INH unexposed periods, and 1 occurred in the pre-exposure period. Compared with non-exposure, the risk of severe hepatitis was higher in exposed periods (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.57-16.55), especially 57-84 days (IRR: 17.29, 95% CI: 3.11-96.25) and 85-168 days (IRR:10.55, 95% CI: 1.90-58.51). The INH related fatal hepatotoxicity was not identified in our study. Our findings suggest an association between risk of severe hepatitis and exposure to isoniazid in patients with RA or AS under TNFi therapy, particularly within the exposed period 57-168 days. A close monitoring of liver function is mandatory to minimize the risk, especially within the first 6 months after initiation of 9 months isoniazid.\nDocument [3]: Title: Isoniazid intervention for latent tuberculosis among 86 patients with rheumatologic disease administered with anti-TNFalpha. Abstract: In this study, we investigated the safety and toxicity of isoniazid (INH) intervention therapy to the patients with latent tuberculosis who were given tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) for the treatment of their rheumatologic diseases. In this prospective clinical study, we enrolled 86 patients receiving anti-TNFalpha therapy for their rheumatologic diseases between April 2005 and September 2006. Of all the subjects, 45 had rheumatoid arthritis, 36 had ankylosing spondylitis, and 5 had psoriatic arthritis. In addition to anti-TNFalpha therapy, 60 of the 86 patients were given INH intervention for revealed latent tuberculosis. INH at a dosage of 300 mg daily was given for 9 months. Hepatotoxicity due to the INH therapy was considered when the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) levels showed at least threefold increase with respect to their baseline serum levels. Serum ALT and AST levels were measured by enzymatic colorimetric method in fasting peripheral blood samples at 0 (baseline), 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 months. Of 86 patients, 47 (54.7%) were women (mean age+/-SD, 44.1 +/- 10.9 years) and 39 (45.3%) were men (38.8 +/- 10.1 years). Except five patients (8.3%), liver toxicity due to the INH therapy was not encountered among the patients, and after temporarily discontinuing the INH therapy of these five subjects, serum transaminase levels returned to the normal ranges. No hepatotoxicity was observed in the non-INH group. However, there was no statistical significance between INH-treated and non-INH-treated group (p = 0.317). In addition, none of the 86 patients developed active tuberculosis infection during the treatment period. In conclusion, for those patients who were assigned to the TNFalpha treatment for their rheumatologic disorders and carrying risk for latent tuberculosis, INH intervention therapy was found to be safe and efficacious.\nDocument [4]: Title: Case Report of Isoniazid-Related Acute Liver Failure Requiring Liver Transplantation. Abstract: The prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in the United States in 2011 and 2012 was estimated at 4.4\u207b4.8%. As of 2015, 12.4 million people still possessed LTBI. Isoniazid, or isonicotinic acid hydrazine (INH), is the most commonly used medication among varying regimens that exist in the treatment of tuberculosis and LTBI. INH-related hepatotoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of its use, often causing asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels. These elevations are typically transient and reversible, but can cause acute, clinically-significant liver injury in rare cases. We report a case of a 67-year old male who developed subacute hepatic injury secondary to INH treatment for LTBI, and ultimately underwent liver transplantation due to the progression to hepatic decompensation, despite withdrawal of the medication. Because symptoms of INH hepatotoxicity are nonspecific and prognosis can be variable, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for this adverse effect. As exemplified by this case, early recognition may be life-saving.\nDocument [5]: Title: A Case of Acute Liver Failure in a Patient on Isoniazid Prophylaxis for Latent Tuberculosis. Abstract: Isoniazid (INH) is widely used for latent <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> despite the known risk of liver injury, with severe hepatitis occurring in up to 1% of patients. We report a patient who presented with two weeks of anorexia, nausea, and jaundice following six months of INH monotherapy for latent tuberculosis (TB). After other causes of liver injury were ruled out, she underwent a liver biopsy showing submassive necrosis, hepatocellular dropout, and lobular inflammation with no evidence of fibrosis. She was also found to have acute portal hypertension. She was diagnosed with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and was treated with n-acetyl cysteine (NAC), ursodiol, and vitamin K. She recovered without the need for a liver transplant. This case supports the need for monitoring of liver tests in high-risk individuals on INH therapy to reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity.\nDocument [6]: Title: Is isoniazid safe for liver transplant candidates with latent tuberculosis? Abstract: Isoniazid (INH) is recommended for tuberculosis prophylaxis in non-liver transplant recipients. However, there is a great reluctance to prescribe this agent for liver transplant candidates and recipients due to the risk of precipitating further hepatic decompensation. We analyzed the records of liver transplantation candidates undergoing a purified protein derivative (PPD) test (tuberculosis skin test) between 2008 and 2010. Patients with no respiratory symptoms, PPD test > 10 mm, and normal chest radiography were diagnosed as latent tuberculosis and prescribed INH (300 mg) per day for 6 months. The 191 patients submitted to a PPD test and those on tuberculosis prophylaxis underwent blood tests and clinical evaluations monthly to detect hepatotoxicity of patients The 33 subjects (17.2%) with a PPD test \u2265 10 mm displayed an average model for end-stage liver disease score of 20 (range: 9-29) and child-Pugh A/B score. The main causes for liver disease were chronic hepatitis C, hepatocellular carcinoma, and alcohol abuse. Among 27 patients who received INH, 18 (66.6%) completed 6 months of prophylaxis. Eight who had shorter treatment courses of 2 to 4 months had undergone transplantation. One patient had to stop treatment because of clinical decompensation due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis without a transaminases elevation. Six patients did not receive INH: previous tuberculosis treatment, transplantation before initiating prophylaxis, or removal from the liver candidacy list. No patient showed clinical decompensation or laboratory abnormalities associated with use of INH. The average values of alanine aminotransferase pre- and posttreatment were similar (69 and 72 U/l respectively), demonstrating that tuberculosis prophylaxis with INH was safe for liver transplant candidates.\nDocument [7]: Title: Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: An update. Abstract: Isoniazid (INH) has been the mainstay of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection for almost 50 years. The currently recommended preferred regimen is 9 months daily self-administered INH (9H); this has efficacy of more than 90% if completed properly. Unfortunately, INH is associated with serious adverse events, including hepatotoxicity. Although risk factors for this complication are well established, allowing for better selection of candidates for therapy, this complication still occurs, and is occasionally fatal. Hence close follow up of patients is necessary, increasing the cost and complexity of treatment. This problem, plus the lengthy duration, results in poor acceptance by patients and providers, and poor adherence by patients. As a result, many preventable cases of tuberculosis continue to occur, and the public health impact of latent tuberculosis infection treatment is suboptimal. These problems have spurred interest in finding shorter, safer and cheaper alternative regimens, with similar efficacy. Of the many regimens that have been examined, 2 months of rifampin and pyrazinamide has excellent efficacy-in experimental studies in mice and randomized trials, largely in HIV-infected persons. However, while the safety of 2 months of rifampin and pyrazinamide appears acceptable in HIV-infected persons and children, in non-HIV-infected adults this regimen is associated with an unacceptably high rate of severe liver toxicity. Three to four months of INH and rifampin has had equivalent effectiveness as 6 months INH in several randomized trials. However, completion of therapy and toxicity has been the same as with INH-possibly because two drugs are taken rather than one. The fourth commonly studied regimen is 4 months rifampin. This has been found to have significantly better completion than 9H, with significantly less toxicity, especially hepatotoxicity. However, only one trial has evaluated efficacy and effectiveness of mono-rifampin therapy. In this trial, 3 months rifampin had somewhat better efficacy than either 3 months of isoniazid and rifampin (3HR) or 6 months isoniazid. Two large scale trials are ongoing; one is comparing efficacy and effectiveness of 9H with 4 months rifampin (both daily and self-administered), while the second, which is nearing completion, compares daily self-administered 9H with 3 months directly observed once weekly INH combined with rifapentine. The results of these two trials will likely shape future recommendations substantially.\nDocument [8]: Title: Isoniazid hepatotoxicity with clinical and histopathology correlate. Abstract: A fifteen-year-old girl was treated with isoniazid (INH) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and subsequently developed epigastric pain, vomiting, and jaundice after three months of treatment. Acute fulminant hepatic failure was diagnosed. INH was stopped, and she received N-acetyl cysteine and Vitamin K. Liver biopsy showed moderate to severe lymphocytic and plasmacytic portal and lobular inflammation, prominent ductal proliferation, moderate cholestasis (predominantly hepatocellular and canalicular), hepatocellular damage, and stage 3 bridging fibrosis. She was treated with steroids and azathioprine for probable autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). She received six months of rifampicin treatment for LTBI. Liver biopsy two years later showed mild portal inflammation, predominantly lymphocytitic, mild portal fibrosis without bridging, irregular bile ducts without cholestasis, and no significant hepatocellular damage; overall the later biopsy demonstrated significant improvement. This case illustrates overlapping morphologic presentation in INH hepatotoxicity with hepatocellular injury and plasma cell infiltrate (due to probable AIH), as well as cholestatic features. Although her follow-up liver biopsy indicated lymphocytic inflammation, she is now asymptomatic with normal hepatic transaminases.\nDocument [9]: Title: Protective effects of metallothionein on isoniazid and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Abstract: Isoniazid (INH) and Rifampicin (RFP) are widely used in the world for the treatment of tuberculosis, but the hepatotoxicity is a major concern during clinical therapy. Previous studies showed that these drugs induced oxidative stress in liver, and several antioxidants abated this effect. Metallothionein (MT), a member of cysteine-rich protein, has been proposed as a potent antioxidant. This study attempts to determine whether endogenous expression of MT protects against INH and RFP-induced hepatic oxidative stress in mice. Wild type (MT+/+) and MT-null (MT-/-) mice were treated intragastrically with INH (150 mg/kg), RFP (300 mg/kg), or the combination (150 mg/kg INH +300 mg/kg RFP) for 21 days. The results showed that MT-/- mice were more sensitive than MT+/+ mice to INH and RFP-induced hepatic injuries as evidenced by hepatic histopathological alterations, increased serum AST levels and liver index, and hepatic oxidative stress as evidenced by the increase of MDA production and the change of liver antioxidant status. Furthermore, INH increased the protein expression of hepatic CYP2E1 and INH/RFP (alone or in combination) decreased the expression of hepatic CYP1A2. These findings clearly demonstrate that basal MT provides protection against INH and RFP-induced toxicity in hepatocytes. The CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 were involved in the pathogenesis of INH and RFP-induced hepatotoxicity.\nDocument [10]: Title: Dexamethasone Pretreatment Alleviates Isoniazid/Lipopolysaccharide Hepatotoxicity: Inhibition of Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress. Abstract: Isoniazid (INH) remains a cornerstone key constitute of the current tuberculosis management strategy, but its hepatotoxic potentiality remains a significant clinical problem. Our previous findings succeed to establish a rat model of INH hepatotoxicity employing the inflammatory stress theory in which non-injurious doses of inflammatory-mediating agent bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) augmented the toxicity of INH that assist to uncover the mechanisms behind INH hepatotoxicity. Following LPS exposure, several inflammatory cells are activated and it is likely that the consequences of this activation rather than direct hepatocellular effects of LPS underlie the ability of LPS to augment toxic responses. In this study, we investigated the potential protective role of the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DEX), a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, in INH/LPS hepatotoxic rat model. DEX pre-treatment successfully eliminates the components of the inflammatory stress as shown through analysis of blood biochemistry and liver histopathology. DEX potentiated hepatic anti-oxidant mechanisms while serum and hepatic lipid profiles were reduced. However, DEX administration was not able to revoke the principal effects of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in INH/LPS-induced liver damage. In conclusion, this study illustrated the DEX-preventive capabilities on INH/LPS-induced hepatotoxicity model through DEX-induced potent anti-inflammatory activity whereas the partial toxicity seen in the model could be attributed to the expression of hepatic CYP2E1. These findings potentiate the clinical applications of DEX co-administration with INH therapy in order to reduce the potential incidences of hepatotoxicity.\nDocument [11]: Title: Lagerstroemia speciosa (L.) Pers., ethanolic extract attenuates simultaneously administered isoniazid- and dapsone-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Abstract: Herbal tea of Lagerstroemia speciosa Pers., commonly known as banaba, has been traditionally used to treat various ailments including diabetes and obesity due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacies. Drug-induced liver injury is a common cause of acute liver failure. Isoniazid (INH) is used as the first-line treatment for tuberculosis; clinical and experimental studies have reported an abnormal liver function after INH therapy. Dapsone (DDS) is used for leprosy and other infections. This study investigates the hepatoprotective effect of ethanolic banaba leaves extract (EBLE) against simultaneously administered INH- and DDS-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. DDS (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and INH (50 mg/kg. p.o.) were administered simultaneously for 30 days. In separate groups, rats were posttreated orally with EBLE (500 mg/kg) and silymarin (100 mg/kg) for 30 days after INH + DDS administration. The marker enzymes of hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers, and histopathology were done. Simultaneous administration of INH- and DDS-induced significant elevation of marker enzymes of hepatotoxicity in the serum. This treatment also increased lipid peroxidation and pro-inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta, and nuclear factor kappa B) expressions and decreased intracellular antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione in the liver tissue. All these abnormalities were significantly mitigated after EBLE and SIL posttreatments. The results of this study suggest that EBLE and silymarin can be protective against INH + DDS-induced hepatotoxicity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Herbal tea contain Lagerstroemia speciosa leaves are used in several Southeast Asian countries due to its rich antioxidant and inflammatory properties. This study showed the hepatoprotective efficacy of L. speciosa ethanolic extract against simultaneously administered dapsone- and isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. L. speciosa administration was found to decrease dapsone- and isoniazid-induced oxidative stress and hepatic inflammation. L. speciosa herbal tea can reduce drug-induced hepatic complications as it contains phytochemicals such as corosolic acid, gallic acid, ellagic acid and berberine and are implicated for its hepatoprotective effect. Therefore, L. speciosa extract can be used for drug-induced liver injury.\nDocument [12]: Title: Phenolic acid-tethered isoniazid for abrogation of drug-induced hepatotoxicity: design, synthesis, kinetics and pharmacological evaluation. Abstract: Morphological and metabolic aberrations in the liver caused by long-term use of anti-tubercular agent isoniazid (INH) have been an issue of great concern in tuberculosis treatment. To resolve this issue, a novel hepatoprotective prodrug strategy was developed by combining the antioxidant property of phenolic acids with INH moiety for probable synergistic effect. In this work, INH was conjugated with phenolic antioxidants using Schotten-Baumann reaction through biocleavable amide linkage. Synthesized prodrugs were characterized by spectral analysis and in vitro release studies were carried out using HPLC. They were found to be stable in acidic (pH 1.2), basic (pH 7.4) buffers, stomach homogenates of rat whereas hydrolyzed significantly (56.03-88.62%) in intestinal homogenates over a period of 6 h. Further their hepatoprotective potential was evaluated in male Wistar rats by performing liver function tests, oxidative stress markers, and histopathology studies. All the prodrugs were effective in abating oxidative stress and re-establishing normal hepatic physiology. Especially the effect of prodrugs of INH with gallic acid and syringic acid in restoring levels of enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and abrogating liver damage was noteworthy. The findings of this investigation demonstrated that reported prodrugs can add safety and efficacy to future clinical protocols of tuberculosis treatment.\nDocument [13]: Title: Isoniazid Prophylaxis for Latent Tuberculosis Infections in Liver Transplant Recipients in a Tuberculosis-Endemic Area. Abstract: BACKGROUND Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis (Px) has good efficacy for preventing tuberculosis (TB) in the general population. However, its use for the treatment of latent TB infections (LTBI) in liver transplant (LT) recipients is challenging because little is known about INH-induced hepatotoxicity in graft recipients. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of INH Px in LT recipients. MATERIAL AND METHODS From March 2008 to December 2012, we retrospectively reviewed data on 277 patients who received LT at a single center. We examined the results of tuberculin skin tests and interferon-\u03b3 release assays, use of INH, INH-induced hepatotoxicity, and post-LT TB occurrence. RESULTS Among 277 recipients, 7 cases of post-transplant TB were detected (2.52%). Seventeen patients received post-transplant INH Px. Among INH Px recipients, post-LT TB infection did not occur. Hepatotoxicity after INH Px was significantly lower in the patients who received INH Px at an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level that was less than 50 U/L than in those who received INH Px at an AST level that was more than 50 U/L (P=0.046, 0.002). CONCLUSIONS INH is likely to be effective for preventing post-LT TB recurrence in LTBI. However, because of INH-induced hepatotoxicity, it is better to avoid using it in the early post-LT period and to wait to initiate INH Px until liver function is stable in LT recipients.\nDocument [14]: Title: Gut microbiota affects sensitivity to immune-mediated isoniazid-induced liver injury. Abstract: Isoniazid (INH) is a highly effective single and/or combined first-line anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) therapy drug, and the hepatotoxicity greatly limits its clinical application. INH-induced liver injury (INH-DILI) is a typical immune-mediated idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury. Existing mechanisms including genetic variations in drug metabolism and immune responses cannot fully explain the differences in susceptibility and sensitivity to INH-DILI, suggesting that other factors may be involved. Accumulating evidence indicates that the development and severity of immune-mediated liver injury is related to gut microbiota. In this study, INH exposure caused liver damage, immune disregulation and microbiota profile alteration. Depletion of gut microbiota ameliorated INH-DILI, and improved INH-DILI-associated immune disorder and inflammatory response. Moreover, hepatotoxicity of INH was ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from INH-treated mice. Notably, Bifidobacterium abundance was significantly associated with transaminase levels. In conclusion, our results suggested that the effect of gut microbiota on INH-DILI was related to immunity, and the difference in INH-DILI sensitivity was related to the structure of gut microbiota. Changes in the structure of gut microbiota by continuous exposure of INH resulted in the tolerance to liver injury, and probiotics such as Bifidobacterium might play an important role in INH-DILI and its \"adaptation\" phenomenon. This work provides novel evidence for elucidating the underlying mechanism of difference in individual's response to INH-DILI and potential approach for intervening anti-TB drug liver injury by modulating gut microbiota.\nDocument [15]: Title: Increased incidence of liver enzymes abnormalities in patients treated with isoniazid in combination with disease modifying and/or biologic agents. Abstract: Reactivation of latent tuberculosis (LTB) has been described with the use of anti-TNFs. Combined treatment of isoniazid (INH) and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can potentially increase the risk of hepatotoxicity. The goal of this study was to investigate the risk of hepatotoxicity in rheumatic patients taking INH while on DMARDs and/or biologics. We reviewed the Institut de Rhumatologie de Montr\u00e9al database (Rhumadata\u00ae) for rheumatic patients with positive tuberculin skin test or quantiFERON who took INH between August 2001 and April 2011. Liver function tests (LFTs) were collected at baseline and during therapy, and LFTs up to 9 months prior to INH initiation were used as controls. Of 922 patients screened for LTB, 87 patients tested positive. During INH treatment, 75.9 % were taking DMARDs, 82.8 % were taking biologics. A total of 375 LFTs performed while on INH were compared to 211 available tests collected prior to INH therapy. Twenty-four percent of the patients had abnormal LFTs during INH compared to 12.1 % prior to INH (p = 0.0481). Most of these abnormalities were mild or transient, but 8 % (seven patients) had significant abnormalities leading to INH discontinuation. Among these patients, mean (min, max) was 241 (52, 617) for AST and 262 (92, 669) for ALT. Although the use of INH therapy in combination with DMARDs and/or biologics was generally well tolerated, the rate of LFT abnormalities was higher when patients were exposed to INH, and significant abnormalities were more frequent than reported in the INH literature. It is prudent to closely follow the LFTs of these patients.\nDocument [16]: Title: A comparison of hepatoprotective activity of Bacoside to Silymarin treatment against a combined Isoniazid and Rifampin-induced hepatotoxicity in female Wistar rats. Abstract: The liver is an important organ that plays a vital role in homeostasis maintenance and regulation. Any liver damage or injury caused by drugs or chemicals is called hepatotoxicity. Isoniazid and rifampin are drugs used separately to treat tuberculosis but have unique side effects and potential hepatotoxicity. The metabolism of isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) takes place in liver hence hepatotoxicity is the main cause of their continuous use. Bacoside was obtained from the plant <i>Bacopa monnieri</i>, a dammarene type triterpenoid saponin, found distributed throughout India. Bacoside has been used as a nerve tonic, a free radical scavenger, and antioxidant. It is known that the combined INH-RIF induced hepatotoxicity can be antagonized by maintaining hepatocyte membrane integrity in rats. Silymarin, an herbal drug, and its component silybin were reported to work as lipid peroxidation inhibitors and antioxidants which scavenge free radicals. Due to minimal toxicity and no adverse drug interactions, Silymarin is used to treat various medically confirmed hepatic disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effect of Bacoside against INH- and RIF-induced toxicity in livers of Wistar albino rats. Four experimental groups of rats were used to study four parameters; bodyweight, liver enzyme markers, liver antioxidant, and liver histopathology. INH- and RIF-treated rats showed abnormalities in liver markers which were normalized by Bacoside and that seems similar to the normal control and Silymarin-treated groups. Thus, the current study demonstrated the hepatoprotective effect of Bacoside against INH- and RIF-induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats.\nDocument [17]: Title: Isoniazid-induced acute liver failure during preventive therapy for latent tuberculosis infection. Abstract: Treating latent tuberculosis infection is a strategy for eliminating tuberculosis, and isoniazid is recommended as preventive therapy. However, concerns have been raised regarding the application of isoniazid due to its toxicity, particularly hepatotoxicity; however, biochemical monitoring is not routinely performed during treatment. We herein present a case of fatal isoniazid-induced acute liver failure. The patient's liver function was not periodically examined and isoniazid therapy was continued for 10 days despite the onset of symptoms associated with hepatitis. The patient died four months after hospitalization. It is essential to consider the potential toxicities of isoniazid and establish strategies to prevent acute liver failure.\nDocument [18]: Title: Toxicological evaluation of oral exposure to isoniazid: behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological assessments in rats. Abstract: Isoniazid (INH), being the first-line drug used as an anti-tuberculosis drug, is known to be associated with physiological deteriorations including hepatic and neurologic disturbances. This study was aimed at biochemical and behavioral characterization of toxic manifestations of isoniazid treatment in <i>Wistar</i> rats. Experimental animals were divided into four groups. Each group consists of six animals including the control group (saline solution), I25 group (25&#8201;mg/kg of INH), I50 group (50&#8201;mg/kg of INH), and I100 group (100&#8201;mg/kg of INH). Animals received daily INH for 30&#8201;days. Isoniazid is known to be associated with hepatotoxicity; it's among the most common causes of drug-induced toxicities. For this reason assays for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were performed to assess liver toxicity. Moreover, behavioral study, renal, and lipid parameters were also assessed in addition to histological features of the liver and brain. Significant differences in all studied parameters were seen especially in the I100 group and a marked increase in liver enzymes activities, such as AST and ALT was observed. In another hand, there were no major clinical signs in treated animals, except fatigue and anxiety in the I100 group. On the other hand, the histological findings showed potential liver and brain injury which was evidenced by degenerative changes, infiltration, and hepatocyte necrosis, in addition to the appearance of many pyramidales cells in the gyrus. The current study findings suggest that INH interacts with multiple biochemical pathways in the body what comes up by behavioral changes and liver disturbances in animals caused by INH toxicity.\nDocument [19]: Title: Investigations on the Influence of Zidovudine in the Pharmacokinetics of Isoniazid and Its Hepatotoxic Metabolites in Rats. Abstract: The HIV-infected patients are co-infected with many bacterial infections in which tuberculosis is most common found worldwide. These patients are often administered with combined therapy of anti-retroviral and anti-tubercular drugs which leads to several complications including hepatotoxicity or adverse drug interactions. The drug-drug interactions between the anti-retroviral and anti-tubercular drugs are not clearly defined and hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions of Zidovudine (AZT) with Isoniazid (INH) and its hepatotoxic metabolites. Seventy two rats were randomly divided into two major groups with their sub-groups each comprising 6 animals. The Group I received INH alone at a dose of 25 mg/kg; b.w and Group II received AZT (50 mg/kg; b.w) along with INH orally. Pharmacokinetic studies of INH and its metabolites i.e., acetyl hydrazine (ACHY) and hydrazine (HYD) shows that INH and ACHY attains maximum plasma concentration ( C<sub>max</sub>) within 30 minutes and HYD attains C<sub>max</sub> at 1 hour after INH administration and all these analytes disappear from plasma within 4 hours. Pharmacokinetic studies also revealed that AZT treatment did not showed any drug-drug interactions and have no effect on the T<sub>1/2</sub>, plasma clearance, AUC, C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> of INH and its hepatotoxic metabolites.\nDocument [20]: Title: The role of chronic hepatitis in isoniazid hepatotoxicity during treatment for latent tuberculosis infection.

Abstract: Rebyota is a rectally administered fecal microbiota suspension for prevention of recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection. The mechanism of action of Rebyota probably involves competitive exclusion of C. difficile by donor microbes with reduced toxin production; other factors may include restoration of protective taxa and modulation of the recipient's microbiome by phage, donor microbes, or metabolites.\nDocument [2]: Title: Application of Microbiome Management in Therapy for <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> Infections: From Fecal Microbiota Transplantation to Probiotics to Microbiota-Preserving Antimicrobial Agents. Abstract: Oral vancomycin and metronidazole, though they are the therapeutic choice for <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections (CDIs), also markedly disturb microbiota, leading to a prolonged loss of colonization resistance to <i>C. difficile</i> after therapy; as a result, their use is associated with a high treatment failure rate and high recurrent rate. An alternative for CDIs therapy contains the delivery of beneficial (probiotic) microorganisms into the intestinal tract to restore the microbial balance. Recently, mixture regimens containing <i>Lactobacillus</i> species, <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i>, or <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> have been extensively studied for the prophylaxis of CDIs. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the transfer of (processed) fecal material from healthy donors to patients for treating CDIs, combined with vancomycin was recommended as the primary therapy for multiple recurrent CDIs (rCDIs). Either probiotics or FMT have been utilized extensively in preventing or treating CDIs, aiming at less disturbance in the microbiota to prevent rCDIs after therapy cessation. Otherwise, many newly developed therapeutic agents have been developed and aim to preserve microbiota during CDI treatment to prevent disease recurrence and might be useful in clinical patients with rCDIs in the future.\nDocument [3]: Title: A Systematic Review of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Versus Vancomycin for Treatment of Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection. Abstract: Clostridioides difficile infection is a major clinical challenge, which may be associated with severe complications. Clostridioides difficile infection may result in repeated episodes of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dehydration, leading to an increased risk of mortality. Increasingly high rates of recurrent Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, refractory to antibiotic therapy, are difficult to treat. The suboptimal response to antibiotic therapy has led to the need for fecal microbiota transplantation in addition to the more commonly prescribed antibiotic, vancomycin. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in adults, compared with an oral vancomycin regimen alone. A systematic literature search was performed, resulting in three randomized control studies. Results from the studies are conflicting, with different variations of study outcomes. In two of the three randomized control trials, fecal microbiota transplantation was statistically significant in effectively resolving Clostridioides difficile infection, but not significant in the third. Although fecal microbiota transplantation results are promising, there are many different variables within the studies, and further research is recommended to explore the effects of these variables within larger sample sizes.\nDocument [4]: Title: My Treatment Approach to Clostridioides difficile Infection. Abstract: Clostridioides difficile infection is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals with an increasing incidence in the community. Clinical presentation of C difficile infection ranges from diarrhea manageable in the outpatient setting to fulminant infection requiring intensive care admission. There have been significant advances in the management of primary and recurrent C difficile infection including diagnostics, newer antibiotics, antibody treatments, and microbiome restoration therapies. Because of the risk of clinical false-positive results with the polymerase chain reaction test, a two-step assay combining an enzyme immune assay for glutamate dehydrogenase and the C difficile toxin is being used. Cost permitting, I treat a first episode of C difficile infection preferably with fidaxomicin over vancomycin but not metronidazole. The most common complication after C difficile infection is recurrence. I manage a first recurrence with a vancomycin taper and pulse or fidaxomicin and recommend a single dose of intravenous bezlotoxumab (a monoclonal antibody against the toxin B) to reduce recurrence rates for those patients at high risk. Patients with multiply recurrent C difficile infection are managed with a course of antibiotics such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin followed by microbiota restoration. The success of fecal microbiota transplantation is greater than 85%, compared with the 40% to 50% success rate of antibiotics in this situation. Fecal microbiota transplantation is heterogeneous and has rare but serious risks such as transmission of infections. Standardized microbiota restoration therapies are in clinical development and have completed phase III clinical trials. This review answers common clinical questions in the management of C difficile infection.\nDocument [5]: Title: Freeze-dried fecal samples are biologically active after long-lasting storage and suited to fecal microbiota transplantation in a preclinical murine model of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection. Abstract: Fecal microbiota transplantation is now recommended for treating recurrent forms of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection. Recent studies have reported protocols using capsules of either frozen or freeze-dried stool allowing oral administration in in- and out-patient settings. However, a central question remains the viability, engraftment, and efficacy of the microbiome over time during storage life. This study shows that both the freeze-drying and freezing procedures for fecal samples allowed preserving viability, short-chain fatty acids concentration, and anti-<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> properties of microbiota without significant alteration after storage for 12&#160;months. Fecal transplantation with freeze-dried microbiota allowed engraftment of microbiota leading to clearance of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection in a preclinical murine model with a survival rate of 70% <i>versus</i> 53-60% in mice treated with frozen inocula, and 20% in the untreated group. Moreover, the freeze-dried powder can be used to fill oral hard capsules using a very low amount (0.5%) of glidant excipient, allowing oral formulation. Altogether, this study showed that freeze-dried inocula can be used for the treatment of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection with long-lasting stability of the fecal microbiota. This formulation facilitates biobanking and allows the use of hard capsules, an essential step to simplify patient access to treatment.\nDocument [6]: Title: Role of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Reducing Clostridioides difficile Infection-Associated Morbidity and Mortality: A Systematic Review. Abstract: <i>Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)</i> is a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that produces toxins A and B, disrupting the intestinal brush border and resulting in severe diarrhea. The most common causes of infection include prolonged antibiotic use, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and long-term hospitalization resulting in complications such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. This&#160;systematic review aims to consider fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as an early treatment modality in <i>C. difficile</i> infection to prevent complications and reduce related morbidity and mortality. We systematically screened three databases using regular keywords such as \"fecal microbiota transplantation,\" \"<i>C. difficile</i>,\" \"pseudomembranous colitis,\" and \"toxic megacolon\" and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed a thorough quality appraisal using standardized checklists. We were finally left with 10 articles, including seven case reports, one case series, and two observational studies. Questions remain as to the route of administration of FMT, timing, safety, availability, and the number of sittings required. More randomized controlled trials are needed to address all these questions and to assess the safety of FMT. We believe the role of FMT is very important as it can prevent <i>C. difficile</i> related complications and would be an ideal treatment option in a population group that is often unfit for surgical management.\nDocument [7]: Title: Does Fecal Microbiota Transplant Have a Role in Treating Recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> Infection in Rural Hospitals? Abstract: <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection possesses a significant economical burden, specifically in the inpatient and rural settings. Fecal Microbiota Transplant has been used for treatment of recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> but its utility is limited by current guidelines and resources. We conducted a retrospective chart review to evaluate the financial benefit of using Fecal Microbiota Transplant after first recurrence of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection. We found that while its use was restricted, on average Fecal Microbiota Transplant can save $11,603.49 per patient. In conclusion, our study shows that using Fecal Microbiota Transplant could prove to be economically beneficial in treating recurrent CDI in rural hospitals.\nDocument [8]: Title: Successful use of early, repeat fecal microbiota transplantation for initial treatment of severe, refractory Clostridioides difficile colitis. Abstract: There is a paucity of literature surrounding the use of early fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for patients presenting with an initial episode of severe, refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Information on optimal antibiotic dosing and therapy duration surrounding FMT during an acute, initial episode of CDI is also limited. Described here is a case of successful treatment of CDI after 4 FMTs during an acute, initial episode of severe, refractory Clostridioides difficile colitis.\nDocument [9]: Title: Patient Perception of Route of Rectal Administration of Live Biotherapeutic Product for Recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> Infection. Abstract: Label=\"Introduction\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">CDI is a recurrent disease that is treated with antibiotics, but patients commonly experience repeat infections with significant impacts on hospital budgets and patient health quality. Standard of care management includes the antibiotics, vancomycin and fidaxomicin, which frequently provide clinical response, but do not avoid recurrence of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (rCDI). These recurrent infections occur due to dysbiosis of the colonic microbiota. One adjunctive therapeutic approach is to restore the deficient gastrointestinal flora using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or live biotherapeutic products (LBP) when given after standard of care antimicrobials, which have been successful in reducing repeat infections with success rates up to 88%. FMT or LBP can be given by various routes.\nDocument [10]: Title: Interactions Between <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> and Fecal Microbiota in <i>in Vitro</i> Batch Model: Growth, Sporulation, and Microbiota Changes. Abstract: Disturbance in gut microbiota is crucial for the development of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI). Different mechanisms through which gut microbiota influences <i>C. difficile</i> colonization are known. However, <i>C. difficile</i> could also affect gut microbiota balance as previously demonstrated by cultivation of fecal microbiota in <i>C. difficile</i> conditioned medium. In current study, the interactions of <i>C. difficile</i> cells with gut microbiota were addressed. Three different strains (ribotypes 027, 014/020, and 010) were co-cultivated with two types of fecal microbiota (healthy and dysbiotic) using <i>in vitro</i> batch model. While all strains showed higher sporulation frequency in the presence of dysbiotic fecal microbiota, the growth was strain dependent. <i>C. difficile</i> either proliferated to comparable levels in the presence of dysbiotic and healthy fecal microbiota or grew better in co-culture with dysbiotic microbiota. In co-cultures with any <i>C. difficile</i> strain fecal microbiota showed decreased richness and diversity. Dysbiotic fecal microbiota was more affected after co-culture with <i>C. difficile</i> than healthy microbiota. Altogether, 62 OTUs were significantly changed in co-cultures of dysbiotic microbiota/<i>C. difficile</i> and 45 OTUs in co-cultures of healthy microbiota/<i>C. difficile</i>. However, the majority of significantly changed OTUs in both types of microbiota belonged to the phylum <i>Firmicutes</i> with <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> origin.\nDocument [11]: Title: \"Bacterial Consortium\": A Potential Evolution of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for the Treatment of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> Infection. Abstract: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) consists of infusion of feces from a donor to a recipient patient in order to restore the resident microbial population. FMT has shown to be a valid clinical option for <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections (CDI). However, this approach shows several criticalities, such as the recruiting and screening of voluntary donors. Our aim was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a synthetic bacterial suspension defined \"Bacterial Consortium\" (BC) infused in the colon of CDI patients. The suspension was composed by 13 microbial species isolated by culturomics protocols from healthy donors' feces. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed both clinically and by metagenomics typing. Fecal samples of the recipient patients were collected before and after infusion. DNA samples obtained from feces at different time points (preinfusion, 7, 15, 30, and 90 days after infusion) were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Before infusion, patient 1 showed an intestinal microbiota dominated by the phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i>. Seven days after the infusion, <i>Bacteroidetes</i> decreased, followed by an implementation of <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i>. Patient 2, before infusion, showed a strong abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i> and a significant deficiency of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i>. Seven days after infusion, <i>Proteobacteria</i> strongly decreased, while <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> increased. Metagenomics data revealed an \"awakening\" by microbial species absent or low concentrated at time T0 and present after the infusion. In conclusion, the infusion of selected bacteria would act as a trigger factor for \"bacterial repopulation\" representing an innovative treatment in patients with <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections.\nDocument [12]: Title: Emerging applications of phage therapy and fecal virome transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection: challenges and perspectives. Abstract: Clostridioides difficile, which causes life-threatening diarrheal disease, is considered an urgent threat to healthcare setting worldwide. The current standards of care solely rely on conventional antibiotic treatment, however, there is a risk of promoting recurrent C. difficile infection (rCDI) because of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Globally, the alarming spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of C. difficile has resulted in a quest for alternative therapeutics. The use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which involves direct infusion of fecal suspension from a healthy donor into a diseased recipient, has been approved as a highly efficient therapeutic option for patients with rCDI. Bacteriophages or phages are a group of viruses that can infect and destroy bacterial hosts, and are recognized as the dominant viral component of the human gut microbiome. Accumulating data has demonstrated that phages play a vital role in microbial balance of the human gut microbiome. Recently, phage therapy and fecal virome transplantation (FVT) have been introduced as promising alternatives for the treatment of C. difficile -related infections, in particular drug-resistant CDI. Herein, we review the latest updates on C. difficile- specific phages, and phage-mediated treatments, and highlight the current and future prospects of phage therapy in the management of CDI.\nDocument [13]: Title: <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> uses amino acids associated with gut microbial dysbiosis in a subset of patients with diarrhea. Abstract: The gut microbiota plays a critical role in pathogen defense. Studies using antibiotic-treated mice reveal mechanisms that increase susceptibility to <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI), but risk factors associated with CDI in humans extend beyond antibiotic use. Here, we studied the dysbiotic gut microbiota of a subset of patients with diarrhea and modeled the gut microbiota of these patients by fecal transplantation into germ-free mice. When challenged with <i>C. difficile</i>, the germ-free mice transplanted with fecal samples from patients with dysbiotic microbial communities showed increased gut amino acid concentrations and greater susceptibility to CDI. A <i>C. difficile</i> mutant that was unable to use proline as an energy source was unable to robustly infect germ-free mice transplanted with a dysbiotic or healthy human gut microbiota. Prophylactic dietary intervention using a low-proline or low-protein diet in germ-free mice colonized by a dysbiotic human gut microbiota resulted in decreased expansion of wild-type <i>C. difficile</i> after challenge, suggesting that amino acid availability might be important for CDI. Furthermore, a prophylactic fecal microbiota transplant in mice with dysbiosis reduced proline availability and protected the mice from CDI. Last, we identified clinical risk factors that could potentially predict gut microbial dysbiosis and thus greater susceptibility to CDI in a retrospective cohort of patients with diarrhea. Identifying at-risk individuals and reducing their susceptibility to CDI through gut microbiota-targeted therapies could be a new approach to preventing <i>C. difficile</i> infection in susceptible patients.\nDocument [14]: Title: Fecal microbiota transplantation as therapy for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection is associated with amelioration of delirium and accompanied by changes in fecal microbiota and the metabolome. Abstract: Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) is a frustrating condition that may affect a person's quality of life for months. Microbiome-based therapy such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been effective for the treatment of rCDI by correcting the imbalance of the gut microbiota. Appropriate antibiotic treatment is recommended for at least two recurrences before offering FMT. Here, we report the case of a 92-year-old woman who experienced five recurrences of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) (six episodes in total) complicated by dementia and delirium, both of which were dramatically improved by FMT, which was associated with alterations in fecal microbiota and the metabolome. Analyses of whole microbial communities and metabolomic analyses were performed on stool specimens collected from the patient on the first episode, the third episode, the day of FMT (before FMT), and 2, 8, and 23 weeks after the FMT and from the donor. The patient had various fecal dysbioses on the first and third episodes and on the day of FMT. Two weeks after FMT, diversity of the gut bacteriome as well as the virome increased dramatically and was reflected in a positive clinical outcome for this patient. Metabolomic analysis revealed that short-chain fatty acids, which have been reported to be associated with improved memory function, were increased after FMT.\nDocument [15]: Title: Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection: Current Clinical Management and Microbiome-Based Therapies. Abstract: Clostridioides difficile is one of the most important causes of healthcare-associated diarrhea. The high incidence and recurrence rates of C. difficile infection, as well as its associated morbidity and mortality, are great concerns. The most common complication of C. difficile infection is recurrence, with rates of 20-30% after a primary infection and 60% after three or more episodes. Medical management of recurrent C. difficile infection involves a choice of therapy that is different from the antibiotic used in the primary episode. Patients with recurrent C. difficile infection also benefit from fecal microbiota transplantation or standardized microbiome restoration therapies (approved or experimental) to restore eubiosis. In contrast to antibiotics, microbiome restoration therapies restore a normal gut flora and eliminate C. difficile colonization and infection. Fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent C. difficile infection has demonstrated higher success rates than vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or placebo. Fecal microbiota transplantation has traditionally been considered safe, with the most common adverse reactions being abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea, and rare serious adverse events. Significant heterogeneity and a lack of standardization regarding the process of preparation, and administration of fecal microbiota transplantation remain a major pitfall. Standardized microbiome-based therapies provide a promising alternative. In the ECOSPOR III trial of SER-109, an oral formulation of bacterial spores, a significant reduction in the recurrence rate (12%) was observed compared with placebo (40%). In the phase III PUNCH CD3 trial, RBX2660 also demonstrated high efficacy rates of 70.6% versus 57.5%. Both these agents are now US Food and Drug Administration approved for recurrent C. difficile infection. Other standardized microbiome-based therapies currently in the pipeline are VE303, RBX7455, and MET-2. Antibiotic neutralization strategies, vaccines, passive monoclonal antibodies, and drug repurposing are other therapeutic strategies being explored to treat C. difficile infection.\nDocument [16]: Title: Therapeutic Effects of Bifidobacterium breve YH68 in Combination with Vancomycin and Metronidazole in a Primary Clostridioides difficile-Infected Mouse Model. Abstract: Probiotics have been widely used to prevent primary Clostridioides difficile infection (pCDI); however, there are fewer studies on their therapeutic aspects for pCDI. In this study, high doses of Bifidobacterium breve YH68 were used alone or in combination with vancomycin (VAN) and metronidazole (MTR) to treat pCDI mice. Mouse feces were collected from preinfection, postinfection, and posttreatment stages. Subsequently, the C. difficile number and toxin level in feces were detected by plate count method and C. difficile toxin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Simultaneously, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were employed to explore the changing patterns and characteristic markers of fecal microbiota and metabolome. The results indicated that high doses of YH68 used alone or in combination with VAN and MTR were more effective than the combination of VAN and MTR for pCDI mice and improved their final survival rate. This probiotic strain and its combination with antibiotics reduced C. difficile numbers and toxin levels in the feces, downregulated proinflammatory cytokine levels in colon tissue, and alleviated cecum tissue hyperplasia. Meanwhile, the level of fecal microbiota diversity increased significantly in pCDI mice after treatment, with an increase in the relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Oscillospira</i>, unidentified<i>_S24-7</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i>, and this process was accompanied by elevated levels of secondary bile acid, butyric acid, and gentamicin C1a and reduced levels of primary bile acid and indoles. Most notably, the combination of YH68 with VAN and MTR diminished the damaging effect of antibiotic treatment alone on the microbiota. Our findings suggested that high doses of YH68 used in combination with VAN and MTR have a better therapeutic effect on pCDI mice than the combination of VAN and MTR alone. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many studies have focused on the preventive effects of probiotics against pCDI, but few studies have investigated in depth the therapeutic effects of probiotics, especially at the postinfection stage. We demonstrated that high doses of Bifidobacterium breve YH68 used alone or in combination with vancomycin (VAN) and metronidazole (MTR) exerted outstanding efficacy in the treatment of pCDI mice. This probiotic-antibiotic combination regimen has the potential to be a new option for the clinical treatment of pCDI.\nDocument [17]: Title: Controversies in the Prevention and Treatment of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> Infection in Adults: A Narrative Review. Abstract: <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> remains a problematic pathogen resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, especially for high-risk groups that include immunocompromised patients. Both the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/SHEA), as well as the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) recently provided guideline updates for <i>C. difficile</i> infection (CDI). In this narrative review, the authors reviewed available literature regarding the prevention or treatment of CDI in adults and focused on disagreements between the IDSA/SHEA and ACG guidelines, as well as articles that have been published since the updates. Several options for primary prophylaxis are available, including probiotics and antibiotics (vancomycin, fidaxomicin). The literature supporting fidaxomicin is currently quite limited. While there are more studies evaluating probiotics and vancomycin, the optimal patient populations and regimens for their use have yet to be defined. While the IDSA/SHEA guidelines discourage metronidazole use for mild CDI episodes, evidence exists that it may remain a reasonable option for these patients. Fidaxomicin has an advantage over vancomycin in reducing recurrences, but its use is limited by cost. Despite this, recent studies suggest fidaxomicin's cost-effectiveness as a first-line therapy, though this is highly dependent on institutional contracts and payment structures. Secondary prophylaxis should focus on non-antimicrobial options to lessen the impact on the microbiome. The oral option of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), SER109, and the now FDA-approved RBX2660 represent exciting new options to correct dysbiosis. Bezlotoxumab is another attractive option to prevent recurrences. Further head-to-head studies of newer agents will be needed to guide selection of the optimal therapies for CDI primary and secondary prophylaxis.\nDocument [18]: Title: The Proton Pump Inhibitor Omeprazole Does Not Promote Clostridioides difficile Colonization in a Murine Model. Abstract: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has been associated with microbiota alterations and susceptibility to <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections (CDIs) in humans. We assessed how PPI treatment alters the fecal microbiota and whether treatment promotes CDIs in a mouse model. Mice receiving a PPI treatment were gavaged with 40&#8201;mg of omeprazole per kg of body weight during a 7-day pretreatment phase, the day of <i>C. difficile</i> challenge, and the following 9&#8201;days. We found that mice treated with omeprazole were not colonized by <i>C. difficile</i> When omeprazole treatment was combined with a single clindamycin treatment, one cage of mice remained resistant to <i>C. difficile</i> colonization, while the other cage was colonized. Treating mice with only clindamycin followed by challenge resulted in <i>C. difficile</i> colonization. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that omeprazole had minimal impact on the structure of the murine microbiota throughout the 16&#8201;days of omeprazole exposure. These results suggest that omeprazole treatment alone is not sufficient to disrupt microbiota resistance to <i>C. difficile</i> infection in mice that are normally resistant in the absence of antibiotic treatment.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Antibiotics are the primary risk factor for <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections (CDIs), but other factors may also increase a person's risk. In epidemiological studies, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has been associated with CDI incidence and recurrence. PPIs have also been associated with alterations in the human intestinal microbiota in observational and interventional studies. We evaluated the effects of the PPI omeprazole on the structure of the murine intestinal microbiota and its ability to disrupt colonization resistance to <i>C. difficile</i> We found omeprazole treatment had minimal impact on the murine fecal microbiota and did not promote <i>C. difficile</i> colonization. Further studies are needed to determine whether other factors contribute to the association between PPIs and CDIs seen in humans or whether aspects of murine physiology may limit its utility to test these types of hypotheses.\nDocument [19]: Title: Clostridioides difficile carriage in animals and the associated changes in the host fecal microbiota. Abstract: The relationship between the gut microbiota and Clostridioides difficile, and its role in the severity of C. difficile infection in humans is an area of active research. Intestinal carriage of toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. difficile strains, with and without clinical signs, is reported in animals, however few studies have looked at the risk factors associated with C. difficile carriage and the role of the host gut microbiota. Here, we isolated and characterized C. difficile strains from different animal species (predominantly canines (dogs), felines (cats), and equines (horses)) that were brought in for tertiary care at North Carolina State University Veterinary Hospital. C. difficile strains were characterized by toxin gene profiling, fluorescent PCR ribotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was done on animal feces to investigate the relationship between the presence of C. difficile and the gut microbiota in different hosts. Here, we show that C. difficile was recovered from 20.9% of samples (42/201), which included 33 canines, 2 felines, and 7 equines. Over 69% (29/42) of the isolates were toxigenic and belonged to 14 different ribotypes including ones known to cause CDI in humans. The presence of C. difficile results in a shift in the fecal microbial community structure in both canines and equines. Commensal Clostridium hiranonis was negatively associated with C. difficile in canines. Further experimentation showed a clear antagonistic relationship between the two strains in vitro, suggesting that commensal Clostridia might play a role in colonization resistance against C. difficile in different hosts.\nDocument [20]: Title: Butyrate Differentiates Permissiveness to Clostridioides difficile Infection and Influences Growth of Diverse C. difficile Isolates. Abstract: A disrupted \"dysbiotic\" gut microbiome engenders susceptibility to the diarrheal pathogen Clostridioides difficile by impacting the metabolic milieu of the gut. Diet, in particular the microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fiber, is one of the most powerful ways to affect the composition and metabolic output of the gut microbiome. As such, diet is a powerful tool for understanding the biology of C. difficile and for developing alternative approaches for coping with this pathogen. One prominent class of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome is short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolic end products of MAC metabolism. SCFAs are known to decrease the fitness of C. difficile <i>in vitro</i>, and high intestinal SCFA concentrations are associated with reduced fitness of C. difficile in animal models of C. difficile infection (CDI). Here, we use controlled dietary conditions (8 diets that differ only by MAC composition) to show that C. difficile fitness is most consistently impacted by butyrate, rather than the other two prominent SCFAs (acetate and propionate), during murine model CDI. We similarly show that butyrate concentrations are lower in fecal samples from humans with CDI than in those from healthy controls. Finally, we demonstrate that butyrate impacts growth in diverse C. difficile isolates. These findings provide a foundation for future work which will dissect how butyrate directly impacts C. difficile fitness and will lead to the development of diverse approaches distinct from antibiotics or fecal transplant, such as dietary interventions, for mitigating CDI in at-risk human populations. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea in humans, and it imposes a tremendous burden on the health care system. Current treatments for C. difficile infection (CDI) include antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplant, which contribute to recurrent CDIs and face major regulatory hurdles, respectively. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to develop new ways to cope with CDI. Notably, a disrupted \"dysbiotic\" gut microbiota is the primary risk factor for CDI, but we incompletely understand how a healthy microbiota resists CDI. Here, we show that a specific molecule produced by the gut microbiota, butyrate, is negatively associated with C. difficile burdens in humans and in a mouse model of CDI and that butyrate impedes the growth of diverse C. difficile strains in pure culture. These findings help to build a foundation for designing alternative, possibly diet-based, strategies for mitigating CDI in humans.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Little is known about referrals from primary care providers (PCPs) for suspected hematologic malignancies, including their clinical triggers and frequency. A random sample of 190 Massachusetts PCPs were presented with a vignette concerning a patient with a new finding of moderate anemia, asked how they would respond, and then asked what they would do if the patient returned with persistent anemia plus one additional sign or symptom. We also asked about referral behaviors for suspected hematologic malignancies during the prior year. A total of 134 (70.5%) PCPs responded. At first anemia presentation,only 3.8% reported referring to hematology. The development of a second sign or symptom yielded higher referral rates: pancytopenia 588.7%, leukopenia 5 63.9%, thrombocytopenia 5 63.9%, lymphadenopathy 5 42.9%, leukocytosis 5 37.6%, night sweats 5 25.6%, and weight loss 5 23.3%. The median yearly number (interquartile range) of patients PCPs reported suspecting of having hematologic malignancy was 5 (3, 10), and the median formally referred was 5 (3, 10). We conclude that anemia plus signs and symptoms suggestive of myelodysplasia or leukemia (compared with those suggestive of lymphoma) are more likely to prompt hematology referral. In addition, given their rarity,the numbe\nDocument [2]: Title: Conversion disorder with convulsion and motor deficit mimicking the adverse effects of high-dose Ara-C treatment in a posttransplant acute myeloid leukemia patient: a case report and review of the literature. Abstract: In this communication, we report an acute leukemia patient who developed conversion disorder mimicking the adverse effects of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) treatment after the patient received high-dose Ara-C treatment. A 21-year-old woman, with acute recurrent leukemia after bone marrow transplantation, received high-dose Ara-C treatment and 10 days later was referred for psychiatric consultation because of an abrupt onset of convulsion. On neurologic examination, she showed convulsion of all the limbs without loss of consciousness. All limbs looked paretic; however, tendon reflexes in all limbs were normal and pathological reflex was not recognized. When her hand was dropped onto her own face, it fell next to her face but not on her face. Laboratory data were unremarkable. She had no history of psychiatric illness or drug or alcohol abuse. The patient explained that she knew about the recurrence of her own leukemia and the news of the death of a close friend due to leukemia at the same time, which was a shocking event for her, focusing her attention on her own fears of dying from the same disease. Conversion disorder in cancer patients is not common; however, appropriate diagnosis is very important to avoid inappropriate examinations and treatments. In leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy, various kinds of signs and symptoms may develop due to the adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or infection. Therefore, conversion disorder might be overlooked and inappropriate treatment and examinations might be performed. Clinicians should consider conversion disorder in the differential diagnosis when patients develop unexplained neurological symptoms.\nDocument [3]: Title: Patient- versus physician-reporting of symptoms and health status in chronic myeloid leukemia. Abstract: The main objective of this study was to compare the reporting of health status and symptom severity, for a set of core symptoms related to imatinib therapy, between chronic myeloid leukemia patients and their treating physicians. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire including questions on symptom severity and health status. The symptoms assessed were: abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, edema, fatigue, headache, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, nausea and skin problems. The physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire for each of their patients entering the study. Four hundred twenty-two patients were included in the study. All respective paired physicians (n=29) completed the questionnaire, and thus the analyses are based on 422 patient-physician dyads. Agreement on symptom ratings ranged from 34% (for muscle cramps) to 66% (for nausea). For all symptoms, patients reported higher severity more often than their physicians. The three symptoms whose severity was most frequently underestimated by physicians were fatigue (51%), muscle cramps (49%) and musculoskeletal pain (42%). Health status was overestimated by physicians in 67% of the cases. Physicians and their patients with chronic myeloid leukemia often disagree in their ratings of the patients' symptom severity. Most typically, physicians tend to underestimate symptom severity and overestimate the overall health status of their patients. Current findings support the use of patient-reported outcome measures as a possible means to enhance the management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.\nDocument [4]: Title: Leukemia: What Primary Care Physicians Need to Know. Abstract: Leukemia is caused by an abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. The four general subtypes are acute lymphoblastic, acute myelogenous, chronic lymphocytic, and chronic myelogenous. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia primarily occurs in children, whereas the other subtypes are more common in adults. Risk factors include certain chemical and ionizing radiation exposures and genetic disorders. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, and easy bruising or bleeding. Diagnosis is confirmed with bone marrow biopsy or peripheral blood smear. Hematology-oncology referral is recommended in patients with suspected leukemia. Chemotherapy, radiation, targeted molecular therapy, monoclonal antibodies, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are common treatments. Complications from treatment include serious infections from immunosuppression, tumor lysis syndrome, cardiovascular events, and hepatotoxicity. Long-term sequelae in leukemia survivors include secondary malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal and endocrine disorders. Five-year survival rates are highest in younger patients and those diagnosed with chronic myelogenous or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\nDocument [5]: Title: Leukemia: an overview for primary care. Abstract: Leukemia is a clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. The four broad subtypes most likely to be encountered by primary care physicians are acute lymphoblastic, acute myelogenous, chronic lymphocytic, and chronic myelogenous. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurs more often in children, whereas the other subtypes are more common in adults. Risk factors include a genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors, such as exposure to ionizing radiation. Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, fatigue, weight loss, bone pain, bruising, or bleeding. A complete blood count usually reveals leukocytosis and other abnormally elevated or depressed cell lines. Patients with suspected leukemia should be referred promptly to a hematologist-oncologist. The diagnosis is confirmed by further examination of the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation, monoclonal antibodies, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Complications of treatment include tumor lysis syndrome and serious infections from immunosuppression. Leukemia survivors should be monitored closely for secondary malignancies, cardiac complications, and endocrine disturbances such as metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism. Five-year survival rates are highest in younger patients and in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\nDocument [6]: Title: How Can We Use Symptom Clusters in Nursing Care of Children with Leukemia? Abstract: The incidence of childhood cancers has been gradually rising worldwide. The rate of leukemia, which is the most common cancer type in childhood, has been increasing as well. In recent years, multiple chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation have been using in leukemia treatment. Children receiving treatment for leukemia may experience many symptoms due to the disease and its treatment. These concurrent symptoms may have a complex relationship. The aim of this paper is to review and compile current literature data related to symptom clusters used to explain multiple symptoms that occur in a complex structure due to leukemia and its treatment. Symptom clustering is used in oncology nursing to explain the complex relationship among multiple symptoms and to find out the effects that symptoms have on each other and patient outcomes. There are generally two statistical approaches to modeling symptom clusters. One is to establish the symptom clusters by grounding on clinical experiences, while the other is to establish them according to the results of statistical analysis and then clinical experiences. With the latter method, symptom clusters can be established more objectively and more number of symptoms can be assessed. In the literature, there are four instruments available for the measurement of a large number of symptoms in children. It is important to increase use of symptom clusters in nursing care for a better understanding of the relationship among multiple symptoms experienced during leukemia treatment, a more effective symptom management, and a more holistic care.\nDocument [7]: Title: Ophthalmic Manifestations of Acute Leukemia. Abstract: Introduction Ocular involvement in leukemia may occur because of direct leukemic infiltration or because of secondary ophthalmic involvement as a result of abnormalities related to blood like anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. In some patients with leukemia, ophthalmic signs can precede the systemic features and can help in early diagnosis of systemic leukemia. Due to the scarcity of data on this topic from Pakistan, we conducted this study to determine the pattern of ocular involvement in patients with leukemia presenting in our settings. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of Pakistan over a period of one year. The study comprised of both newly diagnosed and follow-up patients of acute leukemia of age more than 15 years. Patients underwent detailed ophthalmic anterior and dilated posterior segment examination. Patient's demographic profile, type of leukemia, chemotherapy status, and hematologic findings were also documented. Results There were 97 leukemic patients in the study with 55 (56.7%) males and 42 (43.3%) females. Various ophthalmic manifestations were observed in 47 (48.45%) patients. Forty-two (43.3%) were diagnosed cases with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 55 (56.7%) suffered from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Ophthalmic manifestations were present in 29 patients of AML (52.7%) and 18 patients of ALL (42.85%). Ocular involvement was significantly more common in newly diagnosed (n=32) as compared with follow-up patients (n=15) (p-value = 0.032). Posterior segment (n=48) was the most common site of ocular involvement (n=48, 49.5%) with retinal hemorrhages seen in 40 patients (41.2%) and papilloedema in seven cases (7.2%). Thirty-three (70.2%) out of 47 patients with ophthalmic manifestations were asymptomatic while 14 (29.8%) had ocular symptoms at the time of initial presentation. Conclusion Ophthalmic manifestations were present in about half of the patients with leukemia. Ocular involvement was more prevalent in newly diagnosed cases and in patients with AML.\nDocument [8]: Title: Pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(1;19) in an adult initially presenting as hematuria and bilateral renal enlargement: a case report and literature review. Abstract: Although pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of renal leukemic infiltration; the renal infiltration with leukemia cells as the initial manifestation of leukemia is very rare. Translocation (1;19)(q23;p13) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in patients with ALL and is observed in 5 - 6% of children with pre-B ALL. However, the incidence of t(1;19) in adults is lower, not exceeding 3%, and the prognosis of adult patients is usually poor. Herein, we report a 52-year-old female patient with pre-B ALL who initially presented as bilateral renal enlargement. The cytogenetic analysis revealed chromosomal abnormalities including t(1;19). The patient underwent three consecutive courses of chemotherapy with VDLP (vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asp, and prednisolone) and gained a short complete remission. Her kidneys recovered to normal size, and renal function returned to normal level. However, after complete remission for only 3 months, the patient exhibited resistance to consolidation chemotherapy and indicated evidence of marrow relapse. Although we increased the drug dosage and attempted to use a different protocol, she died of severe anemia and hemorrhage almost 10 months after she was first admitted. In conclusion, pre-B cell ALL is the most common type of leukemia to present with renal infiltration as the presenting sign. Because of the poor outcome of ALL, some new therapeutic approaches may improve the patients' conditions.\nDocument [9]: Title: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood presenting as aplastic anemia: report of two cases. Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common malignancy in pediatric patients; its diagnosis is usually easy to establish as malignant lymphoblasts invade the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Some acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients may initially present with pancytopenia and a hypoplastic bone marrow leading to the initial diagnosis of aplastic anemia. In most of these patients clinical improvement occurs, with normalization of the complete blood count within six months, although recovery can also develop a few weeks after initiating steroid therapy. The etiologic relationship between the aplastic anemia features and the subsequent overt development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been established. We describe the cases of two children who presented with severe infection and signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia confirmed by bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy that developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia thereafter. No specific therapy for aplastic anemia was administered, nevertheless a full spontaneous recovery was observed in both cases. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was successfully treated with standard chemotherapy, both children remaining in complete remission 16 and 17 months after their initial aplastic anemia diagnosis.\nDocument [10]: Title: A Case of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (FAB M2) with Inversion 16 Who Presented with Pelvic Myeloid Sarcoma. Abstract: Acute leukemias are the most common childhood cancer in all age groups. Acute myeloid leukemias (AML) constitute about 15-20% of acute leukemias. Fatigability, pallor, fever, and bleeding are the most common presenting symptoms of AML. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are commonly encountered during physical examination. In rare instances eruptions due to skin involvement and localized tumor masses (myeloid sarcoma) may be found. Myeloid sarcoma is especially seen in AML-M2 subtype. By cytogenetic analysis, in AML-M2 subtype t(8;21) is often seen and it is more probable to find inversion 16 in AML-M4Eos subtype. Herein, we present a 15-year-old girl whose initial symptom was abdominal pain for three days and her pathological sign was a large abdominal mass which was verified by imaging studies and diagnosed as myeloid sarcoma by biopsy. On bone marrow examination, she had diagnosis of AML-M2 and by cytogenetic analysis inversion 16 was positive. She was treated with AML-BFM 2004 protocol and she is being followed up in remission on her ninth month of the maintenance therapy.\nDocument [11]: Title: Management of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in children receiving chemotherapy. Abstract: Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) pneumonia (PCP) is a serious opportunistic infection in children and adolescents with cancer. It was the most common cause of death among children receiving chemotherapy prior to the inclusion of PCP prophylaxis as part of standard care for children with leukemia. The incidence of PCP has decreased significantly since initiation of prophylaxis; however, breakthrough cases continue to occur. Hematologic malignancies, brain tumors necessitating prolonged corticosteroid therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, prolonged neutropenia, and lymphopenia are the most important risk factors for PCP in children not infected with HIV. Of children with leukemia, 15-20% may develop PCP in the absence of prophylaxis. Infection with P. jiroveci occurs early in life in most individuals. However, clinically apparent disease occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised persons. Dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and fever are the most common presenting symptoms of PCP. Chest radiography and high-resolution CT scans of the chest demonstrate a characteristic ground-glass pattern. Induced sputum analysis and bronchoalveolar lavage are the diagnostic procedures of choice. Gomori's methenamine-silver stain, Geimsa or Wright's stain, and monoclonal immunofluorescent antibody stains are most commonly used to make a diagnosis. However, identification of P. jiroveci DNA using polymerase chain reaction assays in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is more sensitive. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ; cotrimoxazole) is the recommended drug for the treatment of PCP. Patients who are intolerant of TMP-SMZ or who have not responded to treatment after 5-7 days of therapy with TMP-SMZ should be treated with pentamidine. A short course of corticosteroids is recommended for moderate to severe cases of PCP within the first 72 hours after diagnosis. Mutations in the dihydropteroate synthetase gene may confer resistance to TMP-SMZ; however, the clinical relevance of these mutations is not well established. TMP-SMZ is the most commonly used agent for prophylaxis. Myelosuppression is the most important adverse effect of TMP-SMZ and the most frequent cause for choosing alternative prophylactic agents in children undergoing chemotherapy. Alternative agents for chemoprophylaxis include dapsone, aerosolized pentamidine, and atovaquone. Alternative prophylactic agents must be used in patients developing myelosuppression secondary to TMP-SMZ or dapsone.\nDocument [12]: Title: [Chronic lymphocytic leukemia]. Abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder that accounts for approximately 30 % of adult leukemias and 25 % of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). It is the most common form of leukemia in the western world (incidence 3-5/100 000). Elderly people are mainly affected, median age at diagnosis is around 70 years and there is a slight predominance in men. The etiology of the disease is unknown. The initial symptoms are nonspecific. Cervical lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly followed by general fatigue are seen most commonly. Other possible symptoms include night sweats, fever, loss of weight (so-called B symptoms) and frequent infections. Several patients develop autoimmune complications as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). To confirm the diagnosis more than 5000 B-lymphocytes/\u00b5l need to be present. The expression of the typical surface markers CD5, CD19, and CD23 has to be confirmed by flow cytometry. Imaging studies as X-ray of the chest, ultrasound of the abdomen, or CT scan are used to assess the degree of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. A bone marrow biopsy is not mandatory for the diagnosis. According to the European Binet staging system, CLL is divided into 3 stages (A, B and C). Patients in Binet stage A have 0 to 2 areas of node or organ enlargement with normal levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Binet stage B patients have 3 to 5 areas of node or organ enlargement and normal or slightly decreased levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Binet stage C patients have anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dl) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelet counts < 100 000/\u00b5l), with or without lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. As there is no survival benefit associated with early intervention, asymptomatic patients with early stage CLL (Binet stage A and B) are usually not treated but are followed on a \"watch and wait\" principle. Treatment indications include stage Binet C or signs of an active disease as rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy or organomegaly together with physical limitation, B symptoms that cannot be tolerated, rapidly deteriorating blood values, or rapidly increasing leukocyte counts. The patient's physical condition has major impact on the treatment decision. Currently immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and the CD20-antibody rituximab (FCR) is the standard of care in previously untreated and physically fit CLL-patients. An alternative regimen is the combination of bendamustine and rituximab (BR). Physically compromised patients can be treated with the oral drug chlorambucil or with bendamustine with or without rituximab. Due to high morbidity and mortality, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is limited to a small group of patients and should be discussed in a high-risk situation, such as 17p deletion, lack of response to standard therapy or early relapse.\nDocument [13]: Title: Small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: are they the same disease? Abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western world, characterized by peripheral blood B-cell lymphocytosis as well as lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenias, and systemic symptoms. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells have a distinctive immunophenotype, and the disease has a characteristic pattern of histological infiltration in the lymph node and bone marrow. The clinical course of CLL is heterogeneous, with some patients presenting with very indolent disease and other patients having a more aggressive malignancy. It is known that genetic abnormalities underlie this difference in clinical presentation. Some patients may present solely with lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and presence of infiltrating monoclonal B cells with the same immunophenotype as CLL cells, but lacking peripheral blood lymphocytosis. This disease is called small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and has been considered for almost 2 decades to be the tissue equivalent of CLL. Both CLL and SLL are currently considered different manifestations of the same entity by the fourth edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. It is suspected that differential expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., reduced expression of R1 and CCR3 in SLL cells), integrins (e.g., CLL cells have lower expression of integrin \u03b1L\u03b22), and genetic abnormalities (a higher incidence of trisomy 12 and lower incidence of del(13q) is found in SLL) may explain some of the clinical differences between these 2 disorders. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the precise biological basis underlying the different clinical presentations of CLL and SLL. It is expected that future studies will shed light on the pathophysiology of both disorders.\nDocument [14]: Title: Pandemic H1N1 influenza infection in children with acute leukemia: a single-center experience. Abstract: In English literature, there are only 2 specific series of pandemic H1N1 influenza infection in children with leukemia. To increase knowledge about pandemic influenza in children with leukemia and better understand the risk factors for severe disease, we have presented the clinical characteristics of 8 children with acute leukemia and pandemic influenza treated at our center. The mean age of the children (4 girls and 4 boys) was 6.7\u00b12.0 years (range, 4 to 10 y). All these children [3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases] were receiving chemotherapy during the course of infection, except 1 who was found to be H1N1 positive at the same time that she was diagnosed with AML. Among the other 7 patients undergoing chemotherapy, 4 were receiving induction, 1 was receiving consolidation, and 2 were undergoing maintenance chemotherapy. In our series, 1 patient with AML had a fatal course. She had recently received a chemotherapy bloc. Her neutrophil count was 0 during the course of H1N1 infection. She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within a short time after the symptoms commenced and she died within 4 days. In conclusion, the clinical course of H1N1 infection may be fatal in rare cases of leukemic children receiving chemotherapy. Thus, vaccination is advisable for all leukemic children, especially for those under maintenance chemotherapy, as it might be life saving during such pandemics.\nDocument [15]: Title: Outcomes of switching to dasatinib after imatinib-related low-grade adverse events in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase: the DASPERSE study. Abstract: Chronic, low-grade adverse events are common in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who are treated with imatinib. These events may decrease patient quality of life and adherence, and may ultimately contribute to a suboptimal response. Alternative, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib, are available with the potential to reduce adverse events, improve tolerability, and support long-term treatment goals. We present the final, primary analysis of DASPERSE/CA180-400 (NCT01660906), an open-label, multicenter, phase IV study designed to determine whether chronic, low-grade nonhematologic adverse events in imatinib-treated patients improve after switching to dasatinib, without affecting efficacy. Of the 121 chronic, grade 1/2, imatinib-related adverse events identified at baseline in 39 patients, 77% resolved or improved within 3 months after switching to dasatinib. Dasatinib maintained a consistent safety profile; headache (33%), pleural effusion (26%), fatigue (23%), and rash (23%) were the most common treatment-related adverse events after the switch. Patients either maintained (56%) or improved (44%) their molecular response on dasatinib. Patients who switched to dasatinib also experienced improved patient-reported symptom burden from baseline as assessed by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for chronic myeloid leukemia (on a 1-10 scale, mean change in disease-specific score was - 2.24 and core symptom severity score was - 1.06). Overall, the efficacy and quality of life/symptom burden improved in many patients, despite the onset of dasatinib-related adverse events in most patients. This suggests that imatinib-treated patients with chronic, low-grade adverse events could benefit from switching to treatment with dasatinib.\nDocument [16]: Title: Fatal cardiac tamponade as the first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia is a hemopoietic myeloid stem cell neoplasm. It is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults,and its incidence increases with age. Acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. As the leukemic cells keep filling the bone marrow, symptoms of the disease started to appear: fatigue, bleeding, increased frequency of infections, and shortness of breath. Cardiac tamponade or pericardial tamponade is an acute medical condition in which the accumulation of pericardial fluid prevents the function of the heart. Signs and symptoms include Beck triad (hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds), paradoxus pulses, tachycardia, tachypnea, and breathlessness. Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are rare and severe complications of leukemia; they often develop during the radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or infections in the course of leukemia. This study sought to assess the fatal cardiac tamponade as the first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found no reports in the literature linking these 2 clinical entities. Although the patient had no signs or diagnosis of AML previously, this case was remarkable for the rapidly progressive symptoms and the fatal outcome. The pericardial effusion reaccumulated rapidly after its initial drainage; it is a possible explanation that the leukemic cells interfered with cardiac activity or that they decreased their contractility myocytes secreting a toxic essence.\nDocument [17]: Title: The management of hyperleukocytosis in 2017: Do we still need leukapheresis? Abstract: Hyperleukocytosis is defined as a white blood cell count greater than 100.000/\u03bcL in patients affected by acute or chronic leukemias. Hyperleukocytosis is more common in acute leukemias than in chronic leukemias. Risk factors include younger age, acute myeloid leukemia, the microgranular variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and some cytogenetic abnormalities. Although it can affect any organ system, symptoms usually arise from involvement of the cerebral, pulmonary and renal microvasculature. The term \"leukostasis\" refers to 'symptomatic hyperleukocytosis' which is a medical emergency that needs prompt recognition and initiation of therapy to prevent renal and respiratory failure or intracranial haemorrhage. The underlying mechanisms of hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis are poorly understood. The management of hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis involves supportive measures and reducing the number of circulating leukemic blast cells by induction chemotherapy, hydroxyurea, low-dose chemotherapy, and leukapheresis. The measures such as hydroxyurea, low-dose chemotherapy, and leukapheresis shouldn't be considered to correct the laboratory abnormalities in patients with hyperleukocytosis who have no signs or symptoms. Also, neither hydroxyurea nore leukapheresis is able to show benefit on short and long term outcomes in patients with symptomatic hyperleukocytosis. The optimal management of symptomatic hyperleukocytosis is still uncertain, and there are no randomized studies demonstrating one is superior to each other. Therefore, it is recommended that intensive chemotherapy should be implemented as quickly as possible in treatment-eligible patients, in parallel with supportive measures for DIC and TLS.\nDocument [18]: Title: Leukemic Oral Manifestations and their Management. Abstract: Leukemia is the most common neoplastic disease of the white blood cells which is important as a pediatric malignancy. Oral manifestations occur frequently in leukemic patients and may present as initial evidence of the disease or its relapse. The symptoms include gingival enlargement and bleeding, oral ulceration, petechia, mucosal pallor, noma, trismus and oral infections. Oral lesions arise in both acute and chronic forms of all types of leukemia. These oral manifestations either may be the result of direct infiltration of leukemic cells (primary) or secondary to underlying thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or impaired granulocyte function. Despite the fact that leukemia has long been known to be associated with oral lesions, the available literature on this topic consists mostly of case reports, without data summarizing the main oral changes for each type of leukemia. Therefore, the present review aimed at describing oral manifestations of all leukemia types and their dental management. This might be useful in early diagnosis, improving patient outcomes.\nDocument [19]: Title: Uncommon Presentation of Childhood Leukemia in Emergency Department: The Usefulness of an Early Multidisciplinary Approach. Abstract: Leukemia is the most common childhood malignancy, and it is often characterized by pallor, fatigue, cytopenia, and organomegaly; sometimes musculoskeletal symptoms, mainly characterized by diffuse bone pain in the lower extremities, are the onset clinical characteristics of the disease. In these cases, the disease may initially be misdiagnosed as reactive arthritis, osteomyelitis, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis delaying appropriate diagnosis and management. Even if leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a history of nighttime pain are reported to be the most important predictive factors for a pediatric leukemia, blood examinations can sometimes be subtle or within normal limits, and this represents a further diagnostic difficulty. Radiological findings of leukemic bone involvement are described in patients with musculoskeletal symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and often appear before hematologic anomalies, but they are not specific for the disease. However, they could be helpful to get the right diagnosis if integrated with other features; thus, it is important knowing them, and it is mandatory for the multidisciplinary comparison to talk about dubious cases even in an emergency setting. We describe 4 patients visited in the emergency department for musculoskeletal complaints and having radiological lesions and a final diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in whom the onset of the manifestations could mimic orthopedic/rheumatologic diseases.\nDocument [20]: Title: Granulocytic sarcoma: a systematic review. Abstract: Granulocytic sarcoma also called myeloid sarcoma is an extramedullary tumor of immature granulocytic cells. It is a rare entity, and mostly accompanied by acute myeloid leukemia. It is observed during the course of myeloproliferative disorders especially in chronic myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. In some rare circumstances, it is detected before clinical signs of leukemia or other diseases. When the bone marrow biopsy reveals no other hematologic malignancies, the granulocytic sarcoma is described as nonleukemic, primary or isolated. It is observed at any part of the body but the most common locations are soft tissues, bone, peritoneum and lymph nodes. Presenting signs or symptoms are mainly due to mass effect of the tumor and dysfunction of the organ, or the tissue that is affected. The diagnosis is performed by biopsy of the tumor. The tumor consists of immature granulocytic cells, which could be documented by H&E, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometric methods. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization and molecular analysis are also performed. The optimal time and type of treatment is not clear. Surgery could be an option especially for tumors, which cause organ dysfunction and/or obstruction. Systemic treatment should be considered in all patients because without systemic treatment, relapses and progression to acute myeloid leukemia is the ultimate fate of the disease in many cases. Cytarabine-containing remission-induction chemotherapies have been the most applied therapeutic strategies, but it is not clear whether the consolidation therapies are required or not, and what kind of regimens are appropriate. The role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSC) as a consolidation regimen is not clear, but, after the relapse of the disease with or without bone marrow involvement, HSC transplantation should be considered in suitable patients after the reinduction performed by AML chemotherapies. There is only limited data about the role of radiotherapy in these patients. It could be used in patients with relapsed disease, organ dysfunction which should be quickly relieved and inadequate response to chemotherapy. The effect of radiotherapy on overall survival is not known. New prospective studies and clinical trials are needed to generate guidelines for the treatment of primary granulocytic sarcomas.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: I thought this prenatal visit would be like any other. But then I read the patient's name-Rosa. Six months earlier, Rosa had left Minnesota with her husband and kids to visit their home and family in Mexico. Their 18-month-old, Manuelo, had been dying. He was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative condition Tay-Sachs disease. She had a second pregnancy that developed normally and I worried. Two days later, her baby, Luz was in my clinic and a blood test showed she had Tay-Sachs disease. Luz died on the way home after two days after Rosa' delivered her next baby. Rosa believed U.S. doctors were wrong. Manuelo didn't have Tay-Sachs. Manuelo's difficulties were from mal de ojo-the evil eye. Rosa told me that they had stopped Manuelo's antiseizure medications a month before his death, and he had seemed better, almost rolling over again. This improvement was strong evidence that mal de ojo had caused his problems. But it had been discovered too late, so Manuelo had died. Caught between wanting to respect their beliefs and worrying about the baby, I probed for any doubt in Rosa's thinking. During their last clinic visit, I asked Rosa how she understood what had happened to Manuelo and Luz. She still believed mal de ojo was responsible. It has been 9 years since that farewell. Recently, I heard from Rosa's extended family in Minnesota that Rosa, Pedro, and their kids are well and plan to return to Minnesota this year. I am looking forward to seeing them. My existence as a physician is dependent on and continually shaped by the patients and families that come to me for care. There is a lot in that process that is not in my control. For me, caring for Rosa and her family was \"one of those things that happens,\" and something that has sculpted me into the physician that I am.

Abstract: A 45-year-old woman presented to our outpatient clinic with reddish eruptions in both palms. We have learned that she was prescribed metoprolol at another medical center to treat new onset hypertension. On her physical examination there were no associated lesions on the body. All other physical findings, as well as blood chemistry, urine analysis, and complete blood count, were found to be normal. After her consultation with the dermatology department, palmar psoriasis due to metoprolol therapy was diagnosed. The personal and family history of the patient yielded no history for psoriasis. Metoprolol therapy was withdrawn and topical treatment with corticosteroid was recommended. The patient has returned to the clinic subsequently, with no recurrence of the lesions. Psoriazis is one of the rare side effects of beta-blocker therapy.\nDocument [3]: Title: Beta-Blocker and Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity With BRASH Syndrome: A Case Report. Abstract: Atrioventricular (AV) nodal blockers have a wide variety of medical uses, including the management of hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. Like any other drug, they can carry side effects and toxicity. We present a case of a patient with a constellation of findings consistent with bradycardia, renal failure, AV nodal blockade, shock, and hyperkalemia (BRASH) syndrome. A 75-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction presented to the hospital with shortness of breath. She was discharged two weeks prior to the presentation from another hospital after being treated for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She was discharged on metoprolol and diltiazem. Upon presentation to the hospital, the patient was noted to be bradycardic and hypotensive with blood work notable for acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia, consistent with BRASH syndrome. She received a dose of intravenous (IV) glucagon followed by infusion and received epinephrine infusion. Once clinically stable, she was discharged with her home dose of metoprolol and a reduced dose of diltiazem with a close follow-up with cardiology. Early recognition of BRASH syndrome as a unique clinical entity rather than different pathologic conditions is important to improve morbidity and mortality in these patients.\nDocument [4]: Title: A Rare Cause of Abdominal Pain. Abstract: A 54 year old woman with hypothyroidism presented with right flank pain that began acutely one week prior to presentation. She was told initially she had a urinary tract infection and treatment resulted in mild symptomatic improvement. The pain returned and she presented to another Emergency Department (ED); and was told the pain was due to constipation. She returned to the ED the next day when her pain worsened and her labs were notable for WBC of 19,000/uL, BUN/Cr of 28/0.75 mg/dL, AST of 31 U/L, ALT of 92 U/L and total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL. RUQ ultrasound was notable for dilation of the common bile duct. Given concern for choledocholithiasis, she was started on cefepime and metronidazole. MRCP demonstrated a distended gallbladder without stones and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid. Also noted were two areas of increased signal in the right kidney, concerning for neoplasia or infarction. Contrasted abdominal Computed tomography showed a moderate size area of hypodensity, consistent with renal infarct. Workup for embolic source of the infarction was unrevealing. Renal artery angiogram demonstrated a spontaneous dissection of the superior branch of the right renal artery. PCI was not performed due to risk of jeopardizing the other vessels and so she was managed medically with rivaroxaban along with hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol succinate to keep her systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg. The morning after the procedure, the patient told the treatment team that her grandson liked to jump from a height and she would catch him on her right side. This was felt to be a likely etiology of her spontaneous dissection. At the time of discharge, her pain was improved and repeat angiogram performed eight weeks later noted healing of the dissection.\nDocument [5]: Title: Malignant Hypertension in Association with Low Estrogen Dose Oral Contraceptives: Case Report and Review of Literature. Abstract: Malignant hypertension (MH) has been described in association with high-dose (50 - 100 mcg) estrogen oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Although the rise in blood pressure (BP) is usually mild, some women will have a more significant increase in BP, and hypertensive emergencies may very rarely occur. We present a 21-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of fibromyalgia and family history of hypertension (both grandparents) who was admitted with a three-day history of headache and blurring of vision in her left eye with a BP of 210/150. Her medications, which were continued on admission, included tramadol, 100 mg twice daily (bid), and low-dose estrogen OCP. During the hospital course, she received different antihypertensive medications and her hypertension was controlled. A diagnosis of MH due to OCP was made. All antihypertensive medications were stopped, except metoprolol, and the patient was discharged home on metoprolol with a BP of 107/55 mmHg. On follow-up in the medical clinic three months later, her visual disturbances had completely resolved and her BP was 98/56 mmHg. One-third of patients aged 15 - 44 years old who develop MH are likely to be on high-dose estrogen OCP. As far as we know, our case is the third documented case of MH occurring in patients on low-dose estrogen OCP. Chronic use of oral contraceptives will slightly increase the systemic BP in most women. It is advisable to avoid OCP in high-risk patients and do regular BP checks on patients on OCP. In patients presenting with hypertension or MH while on OCP, the OCP should be discontinued.\nDocument [6]: Title: Clinically Significant Bradycardia and Hypotension Following Consumption of Betel Leaf in a Patient Treated for Chronic Atrial Fibrillation. Abstract: <b>Purpose:</b> A case of new onset bradycardia and hypotension following betel leaf consumption in combination with verapamil and metoprolol in an atrial fibrillation (AF) patient. <b>Summary:</b> A 66-year-old Nigerian woman presented to the emergency department for evaluation of multiple near syncope episodes with underlying AF and slow ventricular response. After initial evaluation, the patient disclosed she had ingested several betel leaves that morning. She was admitted for observation of severe, progressive hypotension and symptomatic bradycardia. Her past medical history included AF, type 2 diabetes, asthma, obesity, hypertension and hypothyroidism. Her home medications consisted of spironolactone, metoprolol succinate, and verapamil ER. Upon admission, her home medications were held. She received IV fluids and atropine .4&#160;mg IV as needed for symptomatic bradycardia. Approximately 18&#160;h following admission, her vital signs stabilized and her labs returned to baseline. She remained stable and was discharged with a recommendation to continue her home medications at prescribed doses with reduced doses of verapamil and metoprolol and to follow-up with her primary care provider. <b>Conclusion:</b> A patient with a history of AF developed significant hypotension and symptomatic bradycardia after betel leaf consumption resulting in an overnight critical care unit admission. The use of betel leaf is not common in the United States; however, practitioners should be cognizant of the use of complementary and alternative medications like betel leaf and incorporate this knowledge in patient evaluation. Patients consuming betel leaf or betel nut should be evaluated for cardiovascular effects as well as laboratory evaluation for organ damage.\nDocument [7]: Title: Metoprolol succinate therapy associated with erythema multiforme. Abstract: Metoprolol succinate is a widely used medication for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and angina. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who developed erythema multiforme after administration of a low dose of this drug. She also presented with pruritic burning pain throughout her body accompanied by chills. While erythema multiforme has been reported with carvedilol, this is the first observation of metoprolol succinate causing this and physicians should be aware of this potential, yet rare, side-effect.\nDocument [8]: Title: Ivabradine use in refractory unstable angina: a case report. Abstract: In this report, we describe the clinical results of ivabradine use in a patient with a serious form of unstable angina. For this patient, it was proposed that no other therapeutic, pharmacologic or surgical, option was available. The patient is a 75-year-old woman who presented with repeated episodes of retrosternal chest pain. She notably had a history of type II diabetes mellitus treated by insulin for several years and complicated by diabetic macro-angiopathy. ECG tracings recorded during these episodes showed abnormalities of the lateral repolarization phase of ischaemic nature. There was no measured increase in cardiac enzymes. She was transferred to our CCU with a diagnosis of unstable angina. In our CCU, the patient was treated with nitrates, metoprolol, aspirin, clopidogrel and atorvastatin at maximal sustainable doses. Following persistent clinical-instrumental instability, she was subjected to coronary angiography. This study revealed severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease not amenable to surgery or angioplasty revascularization. In addition to the therapy already provided, a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50 mgx2/die) and diltiazem (30 mgx2/die) were added despite their potentially dangerous and adverse chronotropic effects. Despite this treatment, the patients heart rate remained high (between 80 and 100 beats/min). This heart rate appeared to be the main driving cause of her anginal symptoms. At this point, the use of ivabradine seemed the only option, even though use would be off-label compared to current indications for the drugs use. We started with a low dose of 2.5 mg/b.i.d. and titrated up to 5 mg b.i.d. As we titrated, we witnessed a gradual reduction in heart rate. A consequent stabilization of her clinical pattern progressed into an almost unexpected asymptomatic state. After about a week of clinical observation, the patient recovered. After three months, she remains asymptomatic.\nDocument [9]: Title: Marked hypertriglyceridemia in a woman receiving metoprolol succinate. Abstract: \u03b2-blockers are commonly used therapies after acute myocardial infarction and in the management of congestive heart failure and hypertension. We report a case of a middle-aged woman with a history of mild hypertension who was placed on metoprolol succinate. Before initiation of the \u03b2-blocker, her triglyceride level was in the borderline-high range (150-199 mg/dL). On treatment, her triglyceride levels exceeded 1000 mg/dL. She developed fatigue and mild abdominal discomfort but without biochemical evidence of pancreatitis. After discontinuation of metoprolol succinate, her triglyceride levels receded. This case illustrates an uncommon side effect with a very commonly used therapy in clinical practice. Clinicians should closely evaluate medications and/or other therapies in patients presenting with new-onset hypertriglyceridemia especially when levels are sufficiently elevated to pose increased risk of pancreatitis.\nDocument [10]: Title: [Power of personal goal sharing--treatment plan using personal goal maps for patients with mental disorders]. Abstract: A female patient in her sixties with schizophrenia had secretly disposed of all her medication and was not cooperating with hospital staff for about four months. During one of our consultations she mentioned that she wanted to be out of hospital by a certain date. That date happened to be her grandchild's birthday. It was at this point that she shared her goals with us, and voluntarily started having treatment. She was able to return home three months later, just in time to celebrate her grandchild's birthday with her family. A male patient in his sixties was able to leave the seclusion room after 10 years. The first doctor in charge and other hospital staff had firmly believed that releasing him from the seclusion room wasn't a possibility. However the patient decided he wanted to be discharged and was interested in finding out how to go about it. The moment he realized it was possible, his outlook changed immensely. He gradually started to open up and communicate better with his new doctor in charge, and was able to work towards his newly found goals. Staff members were also surprised when he was able to leave the seclusion room. They realized this patient was another person like them who had dreams and goals, and stopped stereotyping patients who seemed to be 'difficult to handle'. I have always experienced the power of goal sharing at clinical scenes, and have noticed its importance for patients making a start on the road to recovery. In order to discuss goals and the way to go about achieving them, I use a simple drawing of a mountain. I call this mountain 'A Personal Goal Map'. I like to think of myself (the doctor) as the mountain guide, and my patient as the mountain climber. The three key philosophies are acknowledging individuality, diversity and freedom. These are important when we think about where we are now, where we are going, and where we want to be. Firstly at the start point, we need to define the patient's problem and discuss ideas and goals, which help us along the Trust Path. The more patients and staff trust and understand each other the easier it is to climb up the Initial Treatment Path. We need to build up trustful relations so we can share personal goals and make a proper assessment and diagnosis, and talk about the safety, efficacy, cost and suitability of the initial treatment. Secondly, we need to take a rest and make more plans for the Recovery Path. It is on this path that we decide on comprehensive treatment together. We may be able to improve the patient's cognitive functions by using atypical anti-psychotic agents. We can then give them information, instructions and warnings about medicine usage so the patient is able to understand their condition. It is only after the patient can understand these things fully and act positively that we can start to climb the final path, the Achievement\nDocument [11]: Title: A 9-year-old girl with persistent obsessive and compulsive behaviors in a primary care pediatric practice. Abstract: Chloe is a 9-year-old gal whose mother made an initial visit to a new pediatrician for concerns about her behavior. Chloe is apprehensive about the visit and frequently hides behind her mother.Her parents first noticed Chloe becoming angry and more emotional 3 years ago, which her parents did not initially understand. However, over the past year, she has started to have more worries and unusual behavior.Chloe and her mother report that when she walks through doorways, she will almost always go back and walks through again. At home, she will walk through doorways multiple times and at school, she will pretend she forgot something so her friends do not notice. She often will not walk downstairs and occasionally her mother has to carry her. Clothes are problematic for Chloe. If her father touches something of a specific color and then touches Chloe, she will have to change her clothes or take a shower. Sometimes, she will never be able to wear those clothes again. She had a recent episode where she could not stop tapping a red paper, because if she stopped, she said it would burst into flame. During the 2 weeks before the pediatric visit, symptoms increased to the point that she is now refusing to go to school. When she stays home, she lays in 1 place all day.Chloe is a fourth grade student. The family does not report academic concerns. She has friends. She denies any appetite or sleep problems. She endorses periods of sadness, lack of energy, and decreased interest in social activities, mostly because she worries and is embarrassed. She kept her behaviors hidden from her 5 siblings for the past year, and she talked only to her mother about them. She is worried her friends might discover her behaviors.The family history is notable for multiple paternal family members with anxiety and bipolar disorder and depression on mother's side. A few months ago, Chloe's family adopted a 7-year-old child with special needs from China.Her growth, vital signs, and physical examination are unremarkable. Her mother filled out the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders, which both had elevated scores.\nDocument [12]: Title: A 9-Year-Old Girl With Persistent Obsessive and Compulsive Behaviors in a Primary Care Pediatric Practice.

Abstract: A 63-year-old woman, who had been treated with 20 mg of paroxetine and 0.5 mg of alprazolam daily for 1 year and with 50 mg of metoprolol daily for 15 days, presented to a facility elsewhere with presyncope and complete atrioventricular block. Three days after her initial presentation and cessation of metoprolol treatment, she was transferred to our clinic to be considered for permanent pacemaker implantation. Paroxetine treatment was discontinued on day 1 and atrioventricular block resolved on day 5, which was confirmed with a 24-hour Holter recording. No bradyarrhythmia was induced with similar doses of either metoprolol or paroxetine alone. At 2- and 3-year follow-up, the patient was still free of bradyarrhythmia documented with electrocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. To our knowledge, we report the first case of complete atrioventricular block associated with coadministration of paroxetine and metoprolol. Increasing physicians' awareness of drug-induced severe bradyarrhythmia might prevent unnecessary implantation of permanent pacemakers.\nDocument [14]: Title: Metoprolol treatment of dual cocaine and bupropion cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. Abstract: Cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, including tachydysrhythmia, agitation, and seizures, may arise from cocaine or bupropion use. We report acute toxicity from the concomitant use of cocaine and bupropion in a 25-year-old female. She arrived agitated and uncooperative, with a history of possible antecedent cocaine use. Her electrocardiogram demonstrated tachycardia at 130 beats/min, with a corrected QT interval of 579 ms. Two doses of 5 mg intravenous metoprolol were administered, which resolved the agitation, tachydysrhythmia, and corrected QT interval prolongation. Her comprehensive toxicology screen returned positive for both cocaine and bupropion. We believe clinicians should be aware of the potential for synergistic cardiovascular and CNS toxicity from concomitant cocaine and bupropion use. Metoprolol may represent an effective initial treatment. Unlike benzodiazepines, metoprolol directly counters the pharmacologic effects of stimulants without respiratory depression, sedation, or paradoxical agitation. A lipophilic beta-blocker, metoprolol has good penetration of the CNS and can counter stimulant-induced agitation.\nDocument [15]: Title: Countertransference revisited. Abstract: A female patient of mine recounts her week. I listen with interest, waiting for her to arrive at particular conclusions. She has suffered a great deal and still does, but prefers not to dwell on it. My interest turns into patience as she continues to talk but circumvents her discontent. She is adroit at avoidance, but easily offended when I point such things out. \"I'd better wait\" I think. I grow more aware that I must encourage her digressions. I feel frustrated. Getting further and further away, she skirts the issue with supple grace, then strays off into tangentiality. I forget her point and lose my focus, then get down on myself. The opportunity is soon gone. I glance at the clock as her monologue drones on into banality. I grow more uninterested and distant. There is a subtle irritation to her voice; a whiney indecisive ring begins to pervade my consciousness. I home in on her mouth with aversion, watching apprehensively as this disgusting hole flaps tirelessly but says nothing. It looks carnivorous, voracious. Now she is unattractive, something I have noticed before. I forget who my next patient is. I think about the meal I will prepare for my wife this evening, then glance at the time once more. Then I am struck: Why am I looking at the clock? So soon? The session has just begun. I catch myself. What is going on in me, between us? I am detached, but why? Is she too feeling unattuned, disconnected? I am failing my patient. What is her experience of me? I lamentingly confess that I do not feel I have been listening to her, and wonder what has gone wrong between us. I ask her if she has noticed. We talk about our feelings, our impact on one another, why we had lost our sense of connection, what it means to us. I instantly feel more involved, rejuvenated, and she continues, this time with me present. Her mouth is no longer odious, but sincere and articulate. She is attractive and tender; I suddenly feel empathy and warmth toward her. We are now very close. I am moved. Time flies, the session is soon over; we do not want it to end.\nDocument [16]: Title: Hypertensive emergency successfully treated with metoprolol: a case report. Abstract: It has been estimated that up to 27% of all medical emergencies presenting to emergency departments are due to hypertension, predominantly in the adult population. Although this often is an insidious process, acutely, a hypertensive emergency occurs when a patient presents with severe hypertension and evidence of end organ damage. We discuss the case of a 12-year-old female with spastic cerebral palsy and global developmental delay secondary to neonatal asphyxia who presented to the emergency department after having a seizure at home. On arrival to the emergency department, she was found to have a heart rate (HR) of 170 and a left upper extremity blood pressure of 174/112. Initial electrocardiogram revealed a HR of 163, with significant ST segment elevations in leads I, II, and minimal elevations in V4, 5, and 6. Intravenous Metoprolol 2.5 mg was administered 3 times with 5 minutes interval between doses, which resulted in a decline in HR (106) and blood pressure (128/86), and subsequent resolution of the electrocardiogram changes. An extensive workup revealed the patient had gallstones, however, her hypertension did not resolve with pain control and, ultimately, cholecystectomy. The remainder of her evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and her blood pressure was, eventually, controlled with 3 medications: clonidine, isradipine, and amlodipine. Over the ensuing 2 years, these were weaned with no recurrent hypertensive episodes. Although studies have shown extended release Metoprolol to be a safe and effective treatment in children with established hypertension, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been studied in a pediatric emergency setting.\nDocument [17]: Title: A Case of an Abdominal Aortic Dissection in a Hemodynamically Stable Marfan Syndrome Patient Presenting without Pain. Abstract: <i>Introduction</i>. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare connective tissue disorder attributed to a defect in the fibrillin-1 gene. Aortic aneurysms and dissection are common causes of morbidity and mortality in Marfan syndrome. <i>Case Report</i>. A 43-year-old female with a history of MFS and a 4.0&#8201;cm dilated ascending aorta presented to her cardiologist reporting that since a C-section two years prior, the left side of her abdomen painlessly protruded when standing. An outpatient CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis noted a 5.5&#8201;cm abdominal aortic dissection, and she was directed to the hospital. Repeat CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a 5.6&#8201;cm dissecting aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. The patient was admitted to the ICU and started on a nitroglycerin drip to maintain systolic blood pressure less than 110&#8201;mmHg. The patient underwent repair of her abdominal aortic dissection via a retroperitoneal approach, and she tolerated the procedure well. She was started on metoprolol tartrate 12.5&#8201;mg BID and aspirin 81&#8201;mg postoperatively. She was safely discharged with follow-up care. <i>Conclusion</i>. This case stresses the importance of having a low threshold to obtain imaging in a MFS patient with protruding abdomen, even though the patient may not have pain and be hemodynamically stable.\nDocument [18]: Title: Drug-facilitated sexual assault: educating women about the risks. Abstract: \"Andrea,\" an 18-year-old college freshman, walked into her first fraternity party with a few of her sorority sisters. As she walked through the crowded house, one of the fraternity boys handed the girls large plastic cups. Another boy circulated through the crowd, filling up the cups of all guests from two pitchers of beer. When he filled Andrea's cup, he smiled and was polite and charming. She thought his act of filling her cup was kind and gentlemanly, and was flattered by his attention. She didn't notice he used a different pitcher for her than he had for her friends. She and her friends continued to mill through the crowd, sipping their beer. About 20 minutes later, Andrea suddenly had trouble focusing her vision. She felt disoriented and \"drunk\" even though she had only consumed a third of her beer. She started feeling nauseated, and tried to find her friends. The polite boy who had poured her beer asked her if she was all right, and offered to take her up to his room so she could rest. She followed him, grateful to be able to lie down. Forty-five minutes later, her concerned friends searched the house for Andrea. They found her upstairs passed out in a bedroom, lying on her side; she had vomited and her clothes were disheveled. Suspecting only alcohol intoxication; they picked her up, and walked her out of the party. After Andrea slept for about two hours, she woke up and told her friends something wasn't right. She had only drunk a small amount of her beer, and had no recollection after she walked up the stairs with the boy. She burst into tears, stating she feels some vaginal discomfort, and is afraid she may have been raped. Her friends looked at each other, thinking, \"How did this happen and what are we supposed to do?\"\nDocument [19]: Title: Agranulocytosis Associated with Topiramate: A Case Report and Review of Published Cases. Abstract: A 41-year-old female presented to the hospital with sore throat and shortness of breath. She was hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% in room air. Physical examination revealed swollen uvula with exudates. She had been started on topiramate for treatment of migraine few months ago. The dose of topiramate was increased to 100&#8201;mg twice daily 2 weeks ago. Complete blood count revealed an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 8&#8201;c/mm<sup>3</sup>. She was intubated and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. She was transferred to our hospital on the fifth day of hospitalization. On arrival, her absolute neutrophil count was 10&#8201;c/mm<sup>3</sup>. Her agranulocytosis was attributed to topiramate after ruling out other possible causes. ANC improved after topiramate was stopped. ANC increased to 1000 after 5 days of stopping topiramate. We also reviewed published cases of topiramate-associated agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis is a rare side effect of topiramate, and only 3 case reports have been published so far. In all cases, agranulocytosis developed after months of topiramate therapy and when dose was increased to 200&#8201;mg daily suggesting a dose-dependent effect. Next steps would be further research on the pathogenesis of agranulocytosis associated with topiramate and creation of registry for data synthesis.\nDocument [20]: Title: Menometrorrhagia and tachyarrhythmia after using oral and topical ginseng. Abstract: Widespread and uncontrolled use of ginseng has raised the question of its side effects and drug interactions. A 39-year-old female patient experienced menometrorrhagia. Her complaints had started 5 months earlier. The laboratory tests revealed follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels to be 10 mIU and 90 mIU, respectively. Endometrial biopsy was planned for the diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding. During the preoperative evaluation, the patient stated that she had been using both oral and topical ginseng for cosmetic reasons. The ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with occasional atrial premature beats. The procedure was postponed for 2 weeks so that the patient would stop taking ginseng, smoking, and drinking coffee. Arrhythmia stopped 10 days later. Tachycardia continued during the procedure but did not require treatment, as it did not cause any hemodynamic instability. An endometrial biopsy specimen showed a disordered proliferative pattern. The patient was advised to stop using oral and topical ginseng. During a follow-up visit, she had no sign of menometrorrhagia or tachyarrhythmia and her hemoglobin levels were in the normal range. Smoking and coffee consumption, along with ginseng use, can be responsible for arrhythmogenic effects. Abnormal uterine bleeding can cause tachycardia secondary to anemia. The clinical progress of this patient is consistent with our hypothesis that ginseng is responsible for menometrorrhagia, although this could be coincidental. Patients should always be asked prior to surgery if they use herbal medications, food supplements, or cosmetics as well as prescription drugs. This is of great importance for both diagnosis and avoidance of drug interactions and side effects during anesthesia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Diabetes is often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is the primary cause of kidney failure in half of patients who receive dialysis therapy. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes and its high morbidity and mortality, diabetic nephropathy is a serious drawback in individual patients and a tremendous socioeconomic burden on society. Despite growing concern for the management of diabetic nephropathy, the prevalence of CKD with diabetes is the same today as it was 20 years ago. The current strategy to manage diabetic nephropathy, including the control of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure and the wide-spread use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, is well established to be beneficial in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy. However, the effects are uncertain in patients with relatively progressed CKD. Therefore, early diagnosis or risk verification is extremely important in order to reduce the individual and socioeconomic burdens associated with diabetic nephropathy by providing appropriate management to prevent the development and progression of this condition. This review focuses on recent research and guidelines regarding risk assessment, advances in medical treatment, and challenges of and future treatments for diabetic nephropathy.\nDocument [2]: Title: [Diabetic nephropathy and prevention of diabetic nephropathy caused chronic renal insufficiency]. Abstract: There is an ongoing trend of a rapid increment in the frequency of diabetes mellitus, expecially the non-insulin dependent form. By the end of the 2nd millenium 150 million cases were recorded worldwide, while the estimations predicted doubling the number by the year 2030. Numerous chronic complications accompany the disease, among them micro-, as well as macrovascular prevail, affecting small and large blood vessels. This paper provides a literature review on the topic of diabetic nephropathy, the main microvascular complication of diabetic disease. Microalbuminuria is the earliest sign of the diabetic renal involvement, with more than 30 mg and less than 300 mg of albumins in 24 h urine sample. The reduction of renal function begins with albuminuria leaving microalbuminuria level and entering the pathologic proteinuria range. Renal failure advances through the 5 stages, the final fifth occurring fortunately only in a minor proportion of the patients. The final stage ensues in 232 of 100 000 diabetic patients, according to the US data. However, in many developed countries there are 30-40% of new patients entering chronic dialysis treatment for diabetic nephropathy. Pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is based on hyperglycemia and distinct hemodynamic changes, glomerular hyperfiltration and high intraglomerular pressure. The important role have oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products, some cytokines, growth factors and sorbitol pathway. Nevertheless, genetic influence is considered by far the most important risk factor for diabetic nephropathy. Heritage determines the susceptibility in one and the protection in another diabetic patient. At the moment of pathologic proteinuria occurrence, glomerular filtration rate begins to decline for 1.2 ml/min/monthly in some patients, making the annual reduction of 7-14 ml/min/1.73 m2 of body surface area. Improving glycemia, blood pressure control, renal anemia correction with rHu-Epo, dyslipidemia control, reduction in protein intake, i.e. management of the nongenetic factors, could slower the renal function loss in some of the patients. Hence, these measures could reduce the proportion of the patients reaching end-stage renal disease, having in mind that morphological and functional changes are reversible only within certain limits. Therefore, the success of kidney protection is better if commenced earlier.\nDocument [3]: Title: Diabetic nephropathy. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic renal disease and a major cause of cardiovascular mortality. Diabetic nephropathy has been categorized into stages: microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria. The cut-off values of micro- and macroalbuminuria are arbitrary and their values have been questioned. Subjects in the upper-normal range of albuminuria seem to be at high risk of progression to micro- or macroalbuminuria and they also had a higher blood pressure than normoalbuminuric subjects in the lower normoalbuminuria range. Diabetic nephropathy screening is made by measuring albumin in spot urine. If abnormal, it should be confirmed in two out three samples collected in a three to six-months interval. Additionally, it is recommended that glomerular filtration rate be routinely estimated for appropriate screening of nephropathy, because some patients present a decreased glomerular filtration rate when urine albumin values are in the normal range. The two main risk factors for diabetic nephropathy are hyperglycemia and arterial hypertension, but the genetic susceptibility in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is of great importance. Other risk factors are smoking, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, glomerular hyperfiltration and dietary factors. Nephropathy is pathologically characterized in individuals with type 1 diabetes by thickening of glomerular and tubular basal membranes, with progressive mesangial expansion (diffuse or nodular) leading to progressive reduction of glomerular filtration surface. Concurrent interstitial morphological alterations and hyalinization of afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles also occur. Podocytes abnormalities also appear to be involved in the glomerulosclerosis process. In patients with type 2 diabetes, renal lesions are heterogeneous and more complex than in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Treatment of diabetic nephropathy is based on a multiple risk factor approach, and the goal is retarding the development or progression of the disease and to decrease the subject's increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Achieving the best metabolic control, treating hypertension (<130/80 mmHg) and dyslipidemia (LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl), using drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, are effective strategies for preventing the development of microalbuminuria, delaying the progression to more advanced stages of nephropathy and reducing cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes.\nDocument [4]: Title: Role of nitric oxide in diabetic nephropathy. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western hemisphere. Endothelial dysfunction is the central pathophysiologic denominator for all cardiovascular complications of diabetes including nephropathy. Abnormalities of nitric oxide (NO) production modulate renal structure and function in diabetes but, despite the vast literature, major gaps exist in our understanding in this field because the published studies mostly are confusing and contradictory. In this review, we attempt to review the existing literature, discuss the controversies, and reach some general conclusions as to the role of NO production in the diabetic kidney. The complex metabolic milieu in diabetes triggers several pathophysiologic mechanisms that simultaneously stimulate and suppress NO production. The net effect on renal NO production depends on the mechanisms that prevail in a given stage of the disease. Based on the current evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that early nephropathy in diabetes is associated with increased intrarenal NO production mediated primarily by constitutively released NO (endothelial nitric oxide synthase [eNOS] and neuronal nitric oxide synthase [nNOS]). The enhanced NO production may contribute to hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria that characterizes early diabetic nephropathy. On the other hand, a majority of the studies indicate that advanced nephropathy leading to severe proteinuria, declining renal function, and hypertension is associated with a state of progressive NO deficiency. Several factors including hyperglycemia, advanced glycosylation end products, increased oxidant stress, as well as activation of protein kinase C and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta contribute to decreased NO production and/or availability. These effects are mediated through multiple mechanisms such as glucose quenching, and inhibition and/or posttranslational modification of NOS activity of both endothelial and inducible isoforms. Finally, genetic polymorphisms of the NOS enzyme also may play a role in the NO abnormalities that contribute to the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy.\nDocument [5]: Title: Role of AGEs in diabetic nephropathy. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the world, and accounts for a significant increase in morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Therapeutic options such as strict blood pressure and/or glycemic control are effective for preventing the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, but the number of diabetic patients on hemodialysis is still increasing. Therefore, a novel therapeutic strategy that could halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy should be developed. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are heterogeneous cross-linked sugar-derived proteins which could accumulate in glomerular basement membrane, mesangial cells, endothelial cells, and podocytes in patients with diabetes and/or end-stage renal failure. AGEs are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy via multifactorial mechanisms such as oxidative stress generation and overproduction of various growth factors and cytokines. Further, recently, the cross-talk between AGEs and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been proposed to participate in diabetic nephropathy. In addition, activation of the RAS elicits ROS generation and subsequently stimulates growth factor and cytokine production by kidney cells as well. These observations suggest that combination therapy with inhibitors of the RAS and blockers of the AGEs formation and/or their downstream pathway may be a novel therapeutic option for preventing diabetic nephropathy. In this paper, we review the role of AGEs and their receptor system in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. We further discuss here the cross-talk between AGEs and the RAS in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy.\nDocument [6]: Title: Molecular mechanisms of diabetic nephropathy and its therapeutic intervention. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal failure, which could account for disabilities and high mortality rates in patients with diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy seems to occur as a result of an interaction between metabolic and hemodynamic factors, which activate common pathways that lead to renal damage. Recent large landmark clinical studies have shown that intensive glucose control reduces the risk of the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, and the blockade renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is also an important target for both metabolic and hemodynamic derangements in diabetic nephropathy. However, diabetic nephropathy remains the leading cause of end-stage renal failure in developed countries. Therefore, to develop novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target diabetic nephropathy may be helpful for most patients with diabetes. High glucose, via various mechanisms such as increased production of oxidative stress and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and activation of the RAS and protein kinase C (PKC), elicits vascular inflammation and alters gene expression of growth factors and cytokines, thereby it might be involved in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. This article summarizes the molecular mechanisms of diabetic nephropathy and the potential therapeutic interventions that may prevent this devastating disorder even in the presence of hyperglycemia, control of which is often difficult with current therapeutic options.\nDocument [7]: Title: Irbesartan: a review of its use in hypertension and in the management of diabetic nephropathy. Abstract: Irbesartan (Avapro, Aprovel) is a potent and selective angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist indicated for use in patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. Once-daily administration of irbesartan provided 24-hour control of blood pressure (BP). In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension irbesartan was as effective as enalapril, atenolol and amlodipine, and more effective than valsartan in terms of absolute reduction in BP and response rates. Irbesartan produced a greater reduction in diastolic BP at trough than once-daily losartan, but had a smaller effect than olmesartan; the reduction in systolic BP achieved with irbesartan was similar or greater than that with losartan and similar to that seen with olmesartan. The combination of irbesartan with hydrochlorothiazide produced additive effects on BP reduction. Irbesartan also induced regression of left ventricular mass in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. In two large studies (IRbesartan MicroAlbuminuria type 2 diabetes mellitus in hypertensive patients [IRMA 2] and the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial [IDNT]) irbesartan exerted a renoprotective effect in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes at both the early and later stages of diabetic nephropathy. The renoprotective effect was at least partly independent of the BP-lowering effect. In the IRMA 2 trial, the proportion of patients progressing to overt nephropathy was significantly lower for recipients of irbesartan 300mg once daily than placebo. In patients with overt nephropathy in the IDNT, irbesartan 300mg once daily provided significantly greater renoprotection than amlodipine 10mg once daily or placebo. The relative risk of doubling of serum creatinine was significantly lower with irbesartan than amlodipine or placebo. Irbesartan is well tolerated in hypertensive patients, including those with type 2 diabetes and incipient or overt nephropathy. The overall incidence of adverse events with irbesartan was similar to that with placebo. Irbesartan was associated with a lower incidence of cough than enalapril and was not associated with ankle oedema or with any clinically significant drug interactions. In conclusion, irbesartan is a well tolerated and effective antihypertensive agent. It also slows the progression of renal disease in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes at both the early and later stages of diabetic nephropathy. Thus, irbesartan is a valuable agent in the management of patients with these indications.\nDocument [8]: Title: A Case of Rapidly Progressive Diabetic Nephropathy Induced by Osimertinib. Abstract: The number of patients with diabetic nephropathy is increasing worldwide and it is important to understand the underlying pathological mechanisms of the disease. In early stage diabetic nephropathy, the hyperglycemic environment leads to vascular endothelial cell damage, resulting in overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in podocytes and renal pathology of glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and mesangial hyperplasia. In diabetic nephropathy, renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) develops and the nephropathy progressively worsens in some cases of severe glomerular podocyte damage. Further, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) may suppress VEGF secretion via VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine kinase inhibition in podocytes, which results in renal TMA and rapid deterioration of diabetic nephropathy. Osimertinib, a third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-TKI, is approved as a first-line treatment agent for metastatic or locally advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. We encountered a case of a patient with diabetic nephropathy with lung adenocarcinoma treated with osimertinib, whose condition deteriorated from early nephropathy to end-stage renal disease in approximately 4 months. The patient had early diabetic nephropathy, but the use of a RTKI suppressed VEGF expression in podocytes, resulting in the induction of renal TMA and the development of rapidly progressive diabetic nephropathy.\nDocument [9]: Title: Prognostic significance of home pulse pressure for progression of diabetic nephropathy: KAMOGAWA-HBP study. Abstract: Pulse pressure (PP) has been noted as a potential independent risk factor for micro and macrovascular diabetic complications. We aimed to examine the prognostic value of home-measured PP (home PP) in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study is a 2-year prospective cohort study of 737 patients with type 2 diabetes. Home blood pressure measurements were performed for 14 consecutive days. We defined the progression of diabetic nephropathy as when the diabetic nephropathy stage advanced to a higher stage during the 2 years. Using logistic regression analyses, we investigated the relationship between home PP and home systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the morning and in the evening and the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, we measured the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess the predictive ability of the progression of diabetic nephropathy of home PP. During the 2-year study, progression of diabetic nephropathy was observed in 94 patients. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) of home PP and home SBP to the progression of diabetic nephropathy were 1.23 (1.01-1.49) and 1.14 (0.98-1.33), respectively. The AUC (95% CI) of home PP to the progression of diabetic nephropathy was 0.624 (0.665-0.679). The optimal cut-off points, sensitivity and specificity for home PP that were associated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy were 57.7 mmHg, 0.649 and 0.580, respectively. Our findings suggest, for the first time, that home PP is an independent predictor of the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nDocument [10]: Title: [The diabetic patient: renal insufficiency like other kidney failures?]. Abstract: The number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy because of diabetic nephropathy has been relentlessly increasing, and diabetes mellitus is now the leading cause of end stage renal disease in most Western Countries. Diabetic nephropathy has specificities. First, it tends to progress rapidly toward end stage renal disease. Second, patients with diabetic nephropathy are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, when compared to patients with non diabetic nephropathy; similarly to what has been shown for diabetic patients on dialysis. Third, patients with diabetic nephropathy tend to be more severely anemic than patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease. Finally, small studies suggest that patients with diabetic nephropathy could have lower serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone than patients with non-diabetic nephropathy and similar glomerular filtration rate.\nDocument [11]: Title: Urinary Thrombin as a Marker of Glomerular Inflammation Associated with Renal Injury in Type 2 Diabetes. Abstract: Glomerular inflammation is a putative aggravation factor for type 2 diabetic nephropathy and urinary thrombin is a novel marker of glomerular inflammation. To clarify the relationship between glomerular inflammation and progression of the nephropathy, we measured urinary thrombin in 118 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy at different stages. To investigate the implications of urinary thrombin in the nephropathy, we compared urinary thrombin with expression of tissue factor, the trigger of blood coagulation activation, in glomeruli and with markers of renal injury (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria). Urinary thrombin was found in 4.9% (3/61), 0.0% (0/12), 29.6% (8/27) and 50.0% (9/18) of patient groups at stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Thus, urinary thrombin was negligible in the patients at early stages (stages 1 and 2), but was present predominantly in the patients at advanced stages (stages 3 and 4). Tissue factor was expressed in accumulated macrophages in glomeruli, which indicates that thrombin may be generated in inflamed glomeruli presumably via inflammation-induced activation of the exudated coagulation factors into glomerular tissues and then be excreted in urine. Urinary thrombin was significantly associated with both decreased eGFR and increased proteinuria in type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, increased urinary thrombin in patients with advanced stages of type 2 diabetic nephropathy suggests that glomerular inflammation may injure the tissues, thereby impairing renal function. Monitoring an effect of anti-diabetic treatments on glomerular inflammation in the patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy may be a possible application of urinary thrombin.\nDocument [12]: Title: Smoking in diabetic nephropathy: sparks in the fuel tank? Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is associated with high morbidity and mortality and the prevalence of this disease is continuously increasing worldwide. Long-term diabetes increases the likelihood of developing secondary complications like nephropathy, the most common cause of end stage renal disease. Usually, other factors like hypertension, alcoholism and smoking also partly contribute to the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Among this, cigarette smoking in diabetes has been repeatedly confirmed as an independent risk factor for the onset and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Various studies suggest that smoking is a major fuel in the development of high oxidative stress and subsequently hyperlipidemia, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, activation of the renin angiotensin system and Rho-kinase, which are observed to play a pathogenic role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, cigarette smoking in diabetic patients with vascular complications produces a variety of pathological changes in the kidney, such as thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and mesangial expansion with progression in glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, which ultimately results in end stage renal failure. Strong associations are consistently found between chronic cigarette smoking and diabetic microvascular complications. A diverse group of studies unveil potential mechanisms that may explain the role of cigarette smoking in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Tremendous efforts are being made to control smoking mediated progression of diabetic nephropathy, but no promising therapy is yet available. The present review critically discusses the possible detrimental role of chronic cigarette smoking in the progression of diabetic nephropathy and various possible pharmacological interventions to attenuate the exacerbation of diabetic nephropathy.\nDocument [13]: Title: [Diabetes and clinical laboratory tests: team medicine]. Abstract: The presentation at this symposium is from the following two perspectives: 1. Indispensability of team medicine for diabetes treatment: Once diabetes has been diagnosed, long-term treatment is essential. Diabetes is often due to a combination of unhealthy lifestyle factors, and treatment therefore requires patients to improve their lifestyles, a certain amount of stoicism also being needed. Patients also have to overcome events in their lives while suffering from diabetes, at the same time as controlling the diabetes, and such events cause stress for the patients, affecting them both psychologically and in terms of lifestyle, so patients' blood sugar levels are disturbed by interactions between stress and lifestyle factors. Medical personnel monitor the progression of numerous diabetic patients, and take different approaches to treatment on the basis of their experience and specialist knowledge. From various perspectives, maintenance of patients' will to continue with treatment is an important aspect of \"team medicine\". Enabling patients to be treated while feeling themselves to be supported by the treatment team is important, and is linked to empowerment of patients, which is the ultimate objective of the treatment guidelines. 2. Importance of team medicine, illustrated by diabetic nephropathy: If diabetic nephropathy progresses to Stage II or further, deterioration of the patient's condition is unavoidable. Medical personnel often think that the patients also will be concerned about the nephropathy, and will therefore not forget about having been told they have nephropathy. However, it has been found that, when subjective symptoms are absent, patients often do not fully understand the explanation, and forget about the nephropathy. It is therefore essential for medical personnel to appreciate that the risk of nephropathic progression is increased if patients do not remember about having nephropathy.\nDocument [14]: Title: [Novel biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy]. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. An early clinical sign of this complication is an increase of urinary albumin excretion, called microalbuminuria, which is not only a predictor of the progression of nephropathy, but also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although microalbuminuria is clinically important to assess the prognosis of diabetic patients, it may be insufficient as an early and specific biomarker of diabetic nephropathy because of a large day-to-day variation and lack of a good correlation of microalbuminuria with renal dysfunction and pathohistological changes. Thus, more sensitive and specific biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnostic capability of identifying patients at high risk. The factors involved in renal tubulo-interstitial damage, the production and degradation of extracellular matrix, microinflammation, etc., are investigated as candidate molecules. Despite numerous efforts so far, the assessment of these biomarkers is still a subject of ongoing investigations. Recently, a variety of omics and quantitative techniques in systems biology are rapidly emerging in the field of biomarker discovery, including proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, and they have been applied to search for novel putative biomarkers of diabetic nephropathy. Novel biomarkers or their combination with microalbuminuria provide a better diagnostic accuracy than microalbuminuria alone, and may be useful for establishing personal medicine. Furthermore, the identification of novel biomarkers may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying diabetic nephropathy.\nDocument [15]: Title: Clinical impact of reducing microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Its early clinical sign is microalbuminuria, which is not only a predictor for progression of nephropathy but also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A few decades ago, diabetic nephropathy was believed to be progressive and irreversible. Thus, the main therapeutic objective for type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria was to prevent progression to overt proteinuria. However, there is now growing evidence regarding remission/regression of diabetic nephropathy. In recent clinical trials using the renin-angiotensin system blockade drugs, a reduction in microalbuminuria by the use of these drugs has been noted. We also reported that a reduction in microalbuminuria was more frequent than progression to overt proteinuria and that multifactorial control approach was important to the reduction of microalbuminuria. These results for type 2 diabetes are similar to those previously reported for type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, our recent study showed that the 8-year cumulative incidence rate of renal and cardiovascular events was significantly lower in patients with remission than in those without it. The annual decline rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with remission was also significantly slower. These studies provide clinical evidence implying that the reduction of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients occurs frequently and brings about renal and cardiovascular risk reduction. Reducing microalbuminuria is therefore considered to be an important therapeutic objective and may be a biomeasure of therapeutic success in type 2 diabetic patients.\nDocument [16]: Title: Diabetic kidney disease; review of the current knowledge. Abstract: Diabetes is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in most parts of the world. 20 to 30% of diabetic patient have diabetic nephropathy in type 1 and type 2. Hyperglycemia is the key of nephropathy creation. Hyperglycemia also by production of toxic materials, advanced glycosylated end product (AGE), increased activity of aldose reductase has some role. Some metabolites of arachidonic acid, hemodynamic derangements and genetic factors have also some role. Although diabetic nephropathy is most common cause of nephropathy in these patients, but diabetic patients are also prone to other urinary tract and renal parenchymal disease and should not be confused with renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy. The principle of treatment of diabetic nephropathy is based on tight control of hyperglycemia, tight control of blood pressure and glomerular pressure, control of dyslipidemia, restriction of protein intake and smoking withdrawal.\nDocument [17]: Title: Overexpression of Serum Micro-RNA 152-3p in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a Significant Elevation in Progressive Nephropathy. Abstract: Modulation of the immune inflammatory system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN); nevertheless, many of the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. A possible role of micro-RNA 152-3p in T2DM and DN has been suggested due to its immunomodulatory effect on the innate immunity. This case control study aimed, first, to determine the possible role of micro-RNA 152-3p in the pathogenesis of T2DM and DN by evaluating its serum expression in T2DM and DN patients. Second, to assess the performance of serum micro-RNAs 16 and 24 as endogenous control in TaqMan assays of micro-RNA analysis by real time PCR in such disease. Quantification of the expression of micro-RNA 152-3p by qRT-PCR was performed using serum of 70 subjects enrolled in this study and grouped into 20 apparently healthy non-diabetic participants (control group), 15 patients with T2DM without nephropathy (DM group) and 35 diabetic patients with nephropathy (DN group). In diabetic patients with nephropathy (DN) (P<0.001), or without nephropathy (DM) (P 0.004), the expression of micro-RNA 152-3p demonstrated a significant elevation in comparison to the controls. Also, the level of micro-RNA 152-3p showed a positive correlation with HbA1c and the duration of diabetes mellitus. The severity of nephropathy as evaluated by markers of renal disease progression; estimated (e)GFR and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) revealed a significant correlation with the level of micro-RNA 152-3p. In the same context, serum level of micro-RNA 152-3p was elevated in diabetics with advanced stage of nephropathy (macroalbuminuria) versus the rest of diabetics (without albuminuria and with microalbuminuria). Two one sided T procedure provided a strong statistical support for equivalence of both micro-RNA s 16 and 24. In conclusion, such findings may indicate a pathologic role of micro-RNA 152-3p in Type 2 diabetes mellitus and in the progression of diabetic nephropathy.\nDocument [18]: Title: Cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy, which represents a major form of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide, and is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with diabetes and CKD have poorer outcomes after myocardial infarction. The underlying pathogenic mechanism that links diabetic nephropathy to a high risk of CVD remains unclear. In addition to traditional risk factors, including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, identification of novel modifiable risk factors is important in preventing CVD in people with diabetes. Inflammation/oxidative stress are known to be associated with an increased risk for CVD in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, homocysteine, advanced glycation end products, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and anemia may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetic nephropathy. This review summarizes the epidemiologic evidence, molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased risk for CVD in patients with diabetic nephropathy, and therapeutic intervention for diabetic nephropathy as evidenced by large-scale clinical trials.\nDocument [19]: Title: Kidney lesions in diabetic patients with normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency. Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease in Japan. Microalbuminuria has been considered as the first clinical sign of diabetic nephropathy. However, recent studies demonstrated that normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency is not uncommon for diabetic patients, especially in type 2 diabetes. Although the pathogenesis of normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency in diabetic nephropathy remains to be fully elucidated, distinct clinical and pathological features of diabetic patients with this finding have been reported as compared to those in diabetic patients with a typical clinical course. In type 1 diabetes, more advanced glomerular lesions were found in patients with normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency than in patients with normoalbuminuric preserved renal function. In contrast, disproportionately advanced tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions, despite minor diabetic glomerular lesions, which denote the presence of diabetic kidney lesions as well as nephrosclerosis, were likely to be related to the development of normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency in some type 2 diabetic patients. In addition, long-term outcomes of diabetic patients with normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency remain controversial. Further studies to gain a better understanding of the structural-functional relationships and natural history of diabetic patients with normoalbuminuric renal insufficiency may improve the benefits of therapeutic interventions for diabetic nephropathy.\nDocument [20]: Title: Allograft diabetic nephropathy may progress to end-stage renal disease. Abstract: Mesangial expansion and glomerular basement membrane thickening characteristic of diabetic nephropathy recur in diabetic recipients of renal allografts from non-diabetic donors but progression to renal failure is minimally documented. Three female renal allograft recipients (aged 40, 62 and 73 yr), who developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to recurrent diabetic nephropathy (two patients) and de novo diabetes (one patient) are reported. Onset of proteinuria, uncontrolled hypertension, azotemia, renal allograft pathologic findings and the need for hemodialysis were analyzed. None of the kidney donors (one cadaver, two living related) had known diabetes or perturbed glucose metabolism pre-transplantation. The three patients presented had different varieties of diabetes; type 1, type 2 and new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). In each subject, proteinuria was detected by dipstick at a mean of 8.3 yr (range 8-9) post-transplantation and increased to the nephrotic range (3.7-4.8 g/day) inducing hypoalbuminemia and azotemia. A histopathologic diagnosis of allograft diabetic nephropathy was made in a mean of 11.7 yr (range 10-14), based on glomerular basement membrane thickening, nodular and diffuse intercapillary glomerulosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and tubular atrophy with marked tubular basement membrane thickening characteristic of advanced diabetic nephropathy. All three patients manifested uremia and resumed hemodialysis. Two patients died from sepsis within 2 months and one patient died 2.5 yr later after resumption of maintenance hemodialysis. We infer that recurrent or de novo diabetic nephropathy in renal allografts follows a clinical decade-long course irrespective of diabetes. Reports of ESRD due to allograft diabetic nephropathy (ADN) have been limited because of shorter survival of diabetic transplant recipients and few kidney biopsies performed in patients with chronic allograft dysfunction. The occurrence of allograft diabetic nephropathy in some, but not all patients, however, suggests that individual genetic variability modulates disease expression.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: This case demonstrates the effective and sustainable use of intermittent fasting (IF) and ketogenic diet (KD) in a normal weight patient with type 2 diabetes, who did not attain glycaemic control with a standard care approach. A 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and strict adherence to a standard diabetic diet presented with a haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 9.3%. Within 4 months of transitioning to KD, combined with IF, she achieved glycaemic control off pharmacotherapy, with HbA1c of 6.4. IF regimens started as 24 hours three times per week, followed by 42 hours three times per week, then 42 hours two times per week and 16 hours once per week. A maintenance phase was then begun at 8 months; IF was reduced to 16 hours per day, with 24 hours three times per month, and metformin was restarted. At 14 months, HbA1c reached 5.8%, and body mass index was minimally changed.\nDocument [2]: Title: TMG-123, a novel glucokinase activator, exerts durable effects on hyperglycemia without increasing triglyceride in diabetic animal models. Abstract: Glucokinase (GK) plays a critical role for maintaining glucose homeostasis with regulating glucose uptake in liver and insulin secretion in pancreas. GK activators have been reported to decrease blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, clinical development of GK activators has failed due to the loss of glucose-lowering effects and increased plasma triglyceride levels after chronic treatment. Here, we generated a novel GK activator, TMG-123, examined its in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characteristics, and evaluated its risks of aforementioned clinical issues. TMG-123 selectively activated GK enzyme activity without increasing Vmax. TMG-123 improved glucose tolerance without increasing plasma insulin levels in both insulin-deficient (Goto-Kakizaki rats) and insulin-resistant (db/db mice) models. The beneficial effect on glucose tolerance was greater than results observed with clinically available antidiabetic drugs such as metformin and glibenclamide in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats. TMG-123 also improved glucose tolerance in combination with metformin. After 4 weeks of administration, TMG-123 reduced the Hemoglobin A1c levels without affecting liver and plasma triglyceride levels in Goto-Kakizaki rats and Diet-Induced Obesity mice. Moreover, TMG-123 sustained its effect on Hemoglobin A1c levels even after 24 weeks of administration without affecting triglycerides. Taken together, these data indicate that TMG-123 exerts glucose-lowering effects in both insulin-deficient and -resistant diabetes, and sustains reduced Hemoglobin A1c levels without affecting hepatic and plasma triglycerides even after chronic treatment. Therefore, TMG-123 is expected to be an antidiabetic drug that overcomes the concerns previously reported with other GK activators.\nDocument [3]: Title: Challenges Related to Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients. Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease with long-term complications. Glycemic control is an important part in management of DM. The first line in treatment of type 2 DM (T2DM) is diet and life style change. Metformin is the first choice of medication in T2DM patients. Sulfonylureas have high risk of hypoglycemia. Glinides are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia in comparison to sulfonylureas. Also, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors decrease the polysaccharides' digestion in small intestine and are less effective in comparison to metformin and sulfonylureas in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These have no risk for hypoglycemia, but gastrointestinal symptoms are common. Thiazolidinediones are known as insulin sensitizers and are effective for a longer duration in comparison to sulfonylureas, however, have side effects such as fluid retention, edema and heart failure. Incretin mimetics including exenatide and liraglutide act through increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, in a glucose-dependent manner. Therefore, these are associated with no risk of hypoglycemia. Pramlintide is an amylin agonist which is also effective in lowering postprandial blood glucose. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and have no risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin decrease blood glucose level by increasing urinary glucose excretion and are associated with weight loss.\nDocument [4]: Title: The Effect of Proton Pump Inhibitors on Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes. Abstract: <b><i>Background:</i></b> Type 2 diabetes patients have decreased pancreatic beta cell mass with a decline in beta cell function. Gastrin has increased beta cell proliferation <i>in vitro</i> and in animal studies. High gastric acid levels inhibit gastrin secretion. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) lower gastric acid, subsequently increasing gastrin levels. This may stimulate beta cell proliferation and function, and improve glycemic control. Studies with small numbers of type 2 diabetes patients have shown a slightly lower A1C in those taking PPI versus non-PPI users. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This study was a retrospective multicenter electronic data analysis using data obtained from health care facilities within Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 21. Patients were included if they had established care within VISN 21 and had type 2 diabetes with an A1C &gt; 6.5%, were started on a PPI concurrently with stable doses of metformin or sulfonylurea (SFU) monotherapy, had at least two documented A1C values, and had a medication possession ratio &gt;80% for metformin, SFU, or a PPI. Veterans were excluded if they were using insulin, combination antihyperglycemic therapy, or oral corticosteroids. A control group not using PPI was also identified. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There was a statistically significant decrease in A1C within each group. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the PPI and control group in the post-A1C. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In patients with type 2 diabetes, A1C improved in both groups, but PPI addition did not affect glycemic control. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the value of PPIs as a treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes.\nDocument [5]: Title: A ketogenic diet reduces mechanical allodynia and improves epidermal innervation in diabetic mice. Abstract: Dietary interventions are promising approaches to treat pain associated with metabolic changes because they impact both metabolic and neural components contributing to painful neuropathy. Here, we tested whether consumption of a ketogenic diet could affect sensation, pain, and epidermal innervation loss in type 1 diabetic mice. C57Bl/6 mice were rendered diabetic using streptozotocin and administered a ketogenic diet at either 3 weeks (prevention) or 9 weeks (reversal) of uncontrolled diabetes. We quantified changes in metabolic biomarkers, sensory thresholds, and epidermal innervation to assess impact on neuropathy parameters. Diabetic mice consuming a ketogenic diet had normalized weight gain, reduced blood glucose, elevated blood ketones, and reduced hemoglobin-A1C levels. These metabolic biomarkers were also improved after 9 weeks of diabetes followed by 4 weeks of a ketogenic diet. Diabetic mice fed a control chow diet developed rapid mechanical allodynia of the hind paw that was reversed within a week of consumption of a ketogenic diet in both prevention and reversal studies. Loss of thermal sensation was also improved by consumption of a ketogenic diet through normalized thermal thresholds. Finally, diabetic mice consuming a ketogenic diet had normalized epidermal innervation, including after 9 weeks of uncontrolled diabetes and 4 weeks of consumption of the ketogenic diet. These results suggest that, in mice, a ketogenic diet can prevent and reverse changes in key metabolic biomarkers, altered sensation, pain, and axon innervation of the skin. These results identify a ketogenic diet as a potential therapeutic intervention for patients with painful diabetic neuropathy and/or epidermal axon loss.\nDocument [6]: Title: Effects of metformin on the glycemic control, lipid profile, and arterial blood pressure of type 2 diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome already on insulin. Abstract: Fifty-seven type 2 diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome and on insulin were assessed by a paired analysis before and 6 months after addition of metformin as combination therapy to evaluate the impact of the association on glycemic control, blood pressure, and lipid profile. This was a historical cohort study in which the files of type 2 diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome on insulin were reviewed. The body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, lipid profile, A1C level, fasting blood glucose level, daily dose of NPH insulin, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were assessed in each patient before the start of metformin and 6 months after the initiation of combination therapy. Glycemic control significantly improved (P < 0.001) after the addition of metformin (1404.4 +/- 565.5 mg/day), with 14% of the 57 patients reaching A1C levels up to 7%, and 53% reaching values up to 8%. There was a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.05) of total cholesterol (229.0 +/- 29.5 to 214.2 +/- 25.0 mg/dL), BMI (30.7 +/- 5.4 to 29.0 +/- 4.0 kg/m2), waist circumference (124.6 +/- 11.7 to 117.3 +/- 9.3 cm), and daily necessity of insulin. The reduction of total cholesterol occurred independently of the reductions of A1C (9.65 +/- 1.03 to 8.18 +/- 1.01%) and BMI and the reduction of BMI and WC did not interfere with the improvement of A1C. In conclusion, our study showed the efficacy of the administration of metformin and insulin simultaneously without negative effects. No changes were detected in HDL-cholesterol or blood pressure.\nDocument [7]: Title: Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abstract: Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus focus on three areas: intensive lifestyle intervention that includes at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity, weight loss with an initial goal of 7 percent of baseline weight, and a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet; aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria) with the use of aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; and normalization of blood glucose levels (hemoglobin A1C level less than 7 percent). Insulin resistance, decreased insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose output are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, and each class of medication targets one or more of these defects. Metformin, which decreases hepatic glucose output and sensitizes peripheral tissues to insulin, has been shown to decrease mortality rates in patients with type 2 diabetes and is considered a first-line agent. Other medications include sulfonylureas and nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. Insulin can be used acutely in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to normalize blood glucose, or it can be added to a regimen of oral medication to improve glycemic control. Except in patients taking multiple insulin injections, home monitoring of blood glucose levels has questionable utility, especially in relatively well-controlled patients. Its use should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient.\nDocument [8]: Title: Diabetes update: screening and diagnosis. Abstract: Busy primary care physicians who want their patients with type 2 diabetes to live longer and better should, as much as possible, base screening and management decisions on patient-oriented evidence that affects morbidity and mortality. Because patients with dual diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension have a high risk of cardiovascular mortality, asymptomatic patients with hypertension should be screened for type 2 diabetes. Screening is conducted using a fasting plasma glucose test, a random A1c test, or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. For obese patients, efforts to prevent diabetes focus on weight reduction and moderate physical activity. In high-risk patients, use of metformin could delay diabetes onset. Diabetes is diagnosed on the basis of an abnormal A1c level, fasting plasma glucose level, or 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test or a symptomatic random plasma glucose level. After diabetes is diagnosed, the physician should obtain blood pressure, body mass index, a lipid panel (fasting not required), kidney function tests, and A1c test, and review vaccination and smoking status. Increased exercise and dietary modification should be recommended. For most patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, metformin should be initiated. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be evaluated; use of daily low-dose aspirin may be considered. Patients who meet treatment criteria for high cholesterol levels should take a statin, and patients with unacceptably elevated blood pressure should take an antihypertensive drug.\nDocument [9]: Title: A Case of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in a Patient on an SGLT2 Inhibitor and a Ketogenic Diet: A Critical Trio Not to Be Missed. Abstract: Results from major clinical trials have shown significant cardiorenal-protective benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), leading to increased popularity. A rare but serious side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA), which presents more covertly but has been described. Identification and report of modifiable risk factors would be an important step in helping clinicians appropriately counsel patients. In this case report, we present DKA in a patient on an SGLT2 inhibitor and ketogenic diet (KD). A 47-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled T2DM on metformin and empagliflozin presented to the emergency department (ED) with several days of pharyngitis, dyspnea, emesis, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Of note, one month prior to this event, he presented to the ED with malaise and was found to have an anion gap of 21, a bicarbonate level of 13 mmol/L, a pH level of 7.22, 3+ ketonuria, and a glucose level of 7 mmol/L (127 mg/dl). Additional workup was negative, and findings were attributed to his KD. His use of empagliflozin was not identified on his medication list. At second presentation, the patient was tachypneic and tachycardic and had mild abdominal tenderness. Labs revealed anion gap 28, bicarbonate 5 mmol/l, pH 6.94, 3+ ketonuria, glucose 14.9 mmol/L (269 mg/dl), and beta-hydroxybutyrate 8.9 mmol/L. The patient was diagnosed with DKA and was treated accordingly. With closure of anion gap, the patient was transitioned to insulin and metformin, and his empagliflozin was discontinued indefinitely. Before prescribing this medication class, physicians should inquire about low-carbohydrate diets given the higher risk for DKA, though knowledge of this risk is still not widespread.\nDocument [10]: Title: Type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycemic control, and cancer risk. Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by prolonged hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and progressive hyperglycemia. Disease management relies on glycemic control through diet, exercise, and pharmacological intervention. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of glycemic control and the use of glucose-lowering medication on the risk of breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N=9486) between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2009 were identified and data on glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c, glucose), glucose-lowering medication use (insulin, metformin, sulfonylurea), age, BMI, date of diabetes diagnosis, insurance status, comorbidities, smoking history, location of residence, and cancer diagnoses were electronically abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to examine the relationship between glycemic control, including medication use, and cancer risk. The results varied by cancer type and medication exposure. There was no association between glycemic control and breast or colon cancer; however, prostate cancer risk was significantly higher with better glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c \u2264 7.0%). Insulin use was associated with increased colon cancer incidence in women, but not with colon cancer in men or breast or prostate cancer risk. Metformin exposure was associated with reduced breast and prostate cancer incidence, but had no association with colon cancer risk. Sulfonylurea exposure was not associated with risk of any type of cancer. The data reported here support hyperinsulinemia, rather than hyperglycemia, as a major diabetes-related factor associated with increased risk of breast and colon cancer. In contrast, hyperglycemia appears to be protective in the case of prostate cancer.\nDocument [11]: Title: Sitagliptin: a novel drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The primary goal of treatment is to target glycemic control by maintaining the glycosylated hemoglobin level near 6-7% without predisposing patients to hypoglycemia. Diabetes results from a combination of increased hepatic glucose production, decreased insulin secretion from beta cells, and insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues. Currently available antidiabetic agents work by different mechanisms to lower blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, each of them has its tolerability and safety concerns that limit its use and dose titration. Sitagliptin is the first antidiabetic agent from the class of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme inhibitors. It increases the amount of circulating incretins, which stimulate insulin secretion and inhibit glucose production. Sitagliptin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. It can be used alone or in combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone) when treatment with either drug alone provides inadequate glucose control. The usual adult dose is 100 mg once daily. A dose of 25-50 mg once daily is recommended for patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials that lasted for up to 6 months, sitagliptin lowered glycosylated hemoglobin levels by 0.5-0.8%. In a 52-week clinical trial, sitagliptin was shown to be noninferior to glipizide as an add-on agent in patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone. Sitagliptin was well tolerated with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal complaints (up to 16%), including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea; hypoglycemia and body weight gain occurred at similar rates compared with placebo. Overall, sitagliptin provides a treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes as a monotherapy, or as an adjunct to metformin or a thiazolidinedione when patients achieve inadequate glycemic control while on either of the agents. It is also an alternative therapy for those patients who have contraindications or intolerability to other antidiabetic agents.\nDocument [12]: Title: Clinical potential of liraglutide in cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence to date. Abstract: Metformin is the first-line therapy for the management of type 2 diabetes. After 3 months of metformin, add-on therapy can be considered if an individual's glycemic control has not been achieved for hemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose levels, and postprandial blood glucose levels. Liraglutide is a potential second-line option for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly for those who are or may be at a high risk of cardiovascular disease. It can also be used an add-on therapy for those individuals with established cardiovascular disease. Liraglutide has additional benefits, such as no to minimal risk of hypoglycemia and promotion of weight loss through its mechanism of action. This particular article summarizes evidence on cardiovascular biomarkers and surrogate endpoints, along with macrovascular events, with liraglutide therapy. Overall, liraglutide has extensive cardiovascular evidence based on which it could be used as a desirable agent for glycemic control while lowering the risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization from heart failure.\nDocument [13]: Title: Metformin activates a duodenal Ampk-dependent pathway to lower hepatic glucose production in rats. Abstract: Metformin is a first-line therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, even though its underlying mechanisms of action are relatively unclear. Metformin lowers blood glucose levels by inhibiting hepatic glucose production (HGP), an effect originally postulated to be due to a hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism. However, studies have questioned the contribution of hepatic AMPK to the effects of metformin on lowering hyperglycemia, and a gut-brain-liver axis that mediates intestinal nutrient- and hormone-induced lowering of HGP has been identified. Thus, it is possible that metformin affects HGP through this inter-organ crosstalk. Here we show that intraduodenal infusion of metformin for 50 min activated duodenal mucosal Ampk and lowered HGP in a rat 3 d high fat diet (HFD)-induced model of insulin resistance. Inhibition of duodenal Ampk negated the HGP-lowering effect of intraduodenal metformin, and both duodenal glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp-1r)-protein kinase A (Pka) signaling and a neuronal-mediated gut-brain-liver pathway were required for metformin to lower HGP. Preabsorptive metformin also lowered HGP in rat models of 28 d HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance and nicotinamide (NA)-streptozotocin (STZ)-HFD-induced type 2 diabetes. In an unclamped setting, inhibition of duodenal Ampk reduced the glucose-lowering effects of a bolus metformin treatment in rat models of diabetes. These findings show that, in rat models of both obesity and diabetes, metformin activates a previously unappreciated duodenal Ampk-dependent pathway to lower HGP and plasma glucose levels.\nDocument [14]: Title: Anti-hyperglycemic effects of propolis or metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abstract: <b /> <i>Background:</i> The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of propolis or metformin <i>versus</i> placebo on glycemic control in pharmacological treatment-na&#239;ve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). <i>Methods:</i> A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled in parallel groups clinical trial was performed in 36 pharmacological treatment-na&#239;ve patients with T2DM. They received propolis (300 mg), metformin (850 mg), or placebo twice daily before breakfast and dinner for 12 weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postload glucose (2-h PG) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and a metabolic profile were measured. Areas under the curve (AUC) of glucose and insulin, total insulin secretion (insulinogenic index), the first phase of insulin secretion (Stumvoll index), and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) were calculated. Statistical analyses: Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests. <i>Results:</i> The propolis and metformin groups exhibited significant reductions in FPG (p=0.009 and p=0.001, respectively), 2-h PG (p=0.034 and p=0.001, respectively) levels, AUC of insulin, Stumvoll index, and an increment in the Matsuda index. The comparison of the changes from baseline to the end showed significant differences between placebo and propolis in FPG (p=0.004) and A1C (p=0.049) levels, while between placebo and metformin were in FPG (p=0.002), 2-h PG (p=0.004) and A1C (p=0.007) levels. <i>Conclusions:</i> The administration of propolis and metformin compared to placebo reduced FPG and A1C levels; in addition, metformin decreased 2-h PG, AUC of glucose and insulin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased the insulin sensitivity.\nDocument [15]: Title: Ketogenic Diet-Induced Diabetic Ketoacidosis in a Young Adult with Unrecognized Type 1 Diabetes. Abstract: Ketogenic diet, a very low-carbohydrate diet and high-fat diet, has emerged as a popular approach for weight reduction, particularly in young adults. However, a serious but rare complication of the ketogenic diet is ketoacidosis associated with low carbohydrate intake, which should be cautiously monitored in people with a predisposition to the condition. We report a 22-year-old Thai woman with an unremarkable past medical history who presented with an acute onset of dyspnea of 2 days' duration. Diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed by elevated capillary blood glucose, significant metabolic acidosis, and a high serum beta-hydroxybutyrate level. Low C-peptide level and positive islet autoantibodies confirmed the new diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in this patient. After her conditions were stabilized, the patient revealed that she began a ketogenic diet for weight reduction 4 days before her illness. Other precipitating factors were not identified. This highlights that ketogenic diet may increase diabetic ketoacidosis risk at the presentation of previously unrecognized type 1 diabetes.\nDocument [16]: Title: Effects of low-carbohydrate diet and ketogenic diet on glucose and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic mice. Abstract: With the prevalence of diabetes worldwide, it is urgent to find a suitable treatment. Recently, the ketogenic diet has shown beneficial effects in reducing blood glucose, but some concerns have been raised about its probable side effects, such as hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Because a low-carbohydrate diet replaces part of the fat with carbohydrates on the basis of the ketogenic diet, we would like to know whether it does better in treating type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of a low-carbohydrate diet as a substitute for a ketogenic diet intervention in mice with type 2 diabetes.\nDocument [17]: Title: The ketogenic diet: Pros and cons. Abstract: Diets have been at the center of animated debates for decades and many claims have been made in one direction or the other by supporters of opposite camps, often with limited evidence. At times emphasis has been put on a single new aspect that the previous diets had overlooked and the new one was to embrace in order to improve weight loss and well-being. Unfortunately, very few randomized clinical trials involving diets have addressed the combined question of weight loss and cardiovascular outcomes. The recently introduced ketogenic diet requires a rigorous limitation of carbohydrates while allowing a liberal ingestion of fats (including saturated fats) and has generated a flurry of interest with many taking the pro position and as many taking the cons position. The ketogenic diet causes a rapid and sensible weight loss along with favourable biomarker changes, such as a reduction in serum hemoglobin A1c in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. However, it also causes a substantial rise in low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and many physicians are therefore hesitant to endorse it. In view of the popular uptake of the keto diet even among subjects not in need of weight loss, there is some preoccupation with the potential long-term consequences of a wide embrace of this diet by large segments of the population. On the contrary, numerous lines of evidence show that plant-based diets are associated with reduction in oncological and cardiovascular diseases and a prolonged life span. The debate reproduced in this article took place during a continuous medical education program between two cardiologists with largely differing views on the matter of effectiveness, sustainability, and safety of the ketogenic diet compared to alternative options.\nDocument [18]: Title: Correlates of treatment patterns among youth with type 2 diabetes. Abstract: OBJECTIVE To describe treatment regimens in youth with type 2 diabetes and examine associations between regimens, demographic and clinical characteristics, and glycemic control. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This report includes 474 youth with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes who completed a SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study visit. Diabetes treatment regimen was categorized as lifestyle alone, metformin monotherapy, any oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) other than metformin or two or more OHAs, insulin monotherapy, and insulin plus any OHA(s). Association of treatment with demographic and clinical characteristics (fasting C-peptide [FCP], diabetes duration, and self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG]), and A1C was assessed by \u03c7(2) and ANOVA. Multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate independent associations of treatment regimens and A1C, adjusting for demographics, diabetes duration, FCP, and SMBG. RESULTS Over 50% of participants reported treatment with metformin alone or lifestyle. Of the autoantibody-negative youth, 40% were on metformin alone, while 33% were on insulin-containing regimens. Participants on metformin alone had a lower A1C (7.0 \u00b1 2.0%, 53 \u00b1 22 mmol/mol) than those on insulin alone (9.2 \u00b1 2.7%, 77 \u00b1 30 mmol/mol) or insulin plus OHA (8.6 \u00b1 2.6%, 70 \u00b1 28 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001). These differences remained significant after adjustment (7.5 \u00b1 0.3%, 58 \u00b1 3 mmol/mol; 9.1 \u00b1 0.4%, 76 \u00b1 4 mmol/mol; and 8.6 \u00b1 0.4%, 70 \u00b1 4 mmol/mol) (P < 0.001) and were more striking in those with diabetes for \u22652 years (7.9 \u00b1 2.8, 9.9 \u00b1 2.8, and 9.8 \u00b1 2.6%). Over one-half of those on insulin-containing therapies still experience treatment failure (A1C \u22658%, 64 mmol/mol). CONCLUSIONS Approximately half of youth with type 2 diabetes were managed with lifestyle or metformin alone and had better glycemic control than individuals using other therapies. Those with longer diabetes duration in particular commonly experienced treatment failures, and more effective management strategies are needed.\nDocument [19]: Title: Long-term treatment study of global standard dose metformin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abstract: In 169 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with blood glucose levels that were inadequately controlled with diet and exercise therapy alone, or with diet and exercise therapy plus a sulfonylurea (SU) drug, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of global standard dose metformin given up to a maximum daily dose of 2250 mg for 54 weeks. The changes in HbA1c from baseline to the final evaluation visit were -1.32 \u00b1 0.76% for metformin monotherapy and -1.29 \u00b1 0.81% for metformin plus SU, both significantly lower than baseline. The incidences of adverse events and adverse drug reactions were 91.1% (154/169 patients) and 67.5% (114/169 patients), respectively. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms, and most of the gastrointestinal symptoms were considered by investigators to be related to metformin treatment. An increased blood lactic acid level was observed in three subjects (1.8%); however, no clinical symptoms were reported, and there was no increase in mean lactic acid concentration throughout the evaluation period. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were reported in 16 patients, all receiving metformin plus SU, but none received metformin monotherapy. There was a decrease in mean body weight. Global standard dose metformin may be useful for maintaining good blood glucose control over the long term in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japanese patients.\nDocument [20]: Title: Efficacy of berberine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abstract: Berberine has been shown to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism in vitro and in vivo. This pilot study was to determine the efficacy and safety of berberine in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. In study A, 36 adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to treatment with berberine or metformin (0.5 g 3 times a day) in a 3-month trial. The hypoglycemic effect of berberine was similar to that of metformin. Significant decreases in hemoglobin A1c (from 9.5%+/-0.5% to 7.5%+/-0.4%, P<.01), fasting blood glucose (from 10.6+/-0.9 mmol/L to 6.9+/-0.5 mmol/L, P<.01), postprandial blood glucose (from 19.8+/-1.7 to 11.1+/-0.9 mmol/L, P<.01), and plasma triglycerides (from 1.13+/-0.13 to 0.89+/-0.03 mmol/L, P<.05) were observed in the berberine group. In study B, 48 adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated supplemented with berberine in a 3-month trial. Berberine acted by lowering fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose from 1 week to the end of the trial. Hemoglobin A1c decreased from 8.1%+/-0.2% to 7.3%+/-0.3% (P<.001). Fasting plasma insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index were reduced by 28.1% and 44.7% (P<.001), respectively. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were decreased significantly as well. During the trial, 20 (34.5%) patients experienced transient gastrointestinal adverse effects. Functional liver or kidney damages were not observed for all patients. In conclusion, this pilot study indicates that berberine is a potent oral hypoglycemic agent with beneficial effects on lipid metabolism.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health challenge and a leading cause of death worldwide. Several risk factors have been identified, with cigarette smoking being the most important. Diagnostic assessment is based on symptoms, risk of exacerbations and results of lung function testing. A fixed post-bronchodilator ratio for forced expiratory volume in one second to forced expiratory volume (FEV1/FVC) of <0.7 is required to make the diagnosis, and the severity of airflow obstruction defines the grade according to GOLD (Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD). The GOLD strategy makes therapeutic recommendations taking into account the grade, symptomatic assessment and future risk of exacerbations. This review focuses on the therapeutic options for COPD, in accordance with the GOLD strategy. Smoking cessation is the most effective treatment option in all COPD stages. Bronchodilators, namely long-acting antimuscarinic drugs and long-acting beta-agonists, form the mainstay of treatment in COPD. Patients with frequent exacerbations also benefited from the addition of inhaled corticosteroids. Roflumilast is an add-on option for patients with severe COPD. Several controversies are the subject of discussion: (1.) whether pharmacotherapy can modify the natural history of COPD; (2.) whether pharmacotherapy should be started in the early stages of COPD; (3.) the impact of therapy on comorbidities; (4.) whether patients benefit from a combination therapy with a long-acting beta-agonist, a long-acting antimuscarinic drug and an inhaled corticosteroid; (5.) step-down therapy. This overview also reviews the evidence for recommended vaccines in COPD, as well as nonpharmacological therapies. Rehabilitation is an essential part of COPD treatment. Oxygen therapy, noninvasive nocturnal ventilation and surgical treatment options only apply to a highly selected group of patients. Disease management programmes and guideline adherence are briefly discussed. In conclusion, although there is debate as to the extent with which pharmacological therapies influence mortality, adherence to the GOLD strategy is recommended.\nDocument [2]: Title: Phenotype of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Based on Computed Tomography-Defined Underlying Pathology. Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex and heterogeneous disease. Not all patients with COPD respond to available drugs. Identifying respondents to therapy is critical to delivering the most appropriate treatment and avoiding unnecessary medication. Recognition of individual patients' dominant characteristics by phenotype is a useful tool to better understand their disease and tailor treatment accordingly. To look for a suitable phenotype, it is important to understand what makes COPD complex and heterogeneous. The pathology of COPD includes small airway disease and/or emphysema. Thus, COPD is not a single disease entity. In addition, there are two types (panlobular and centrilobular) of emphysema in COPD. The coexistence of different pathological subtypes could be the reason for the complexity and heterogeneity of COPD. Thus, it is necessary to look for the phenotype based on the difference in the underlying pathology. Review of the literature has shown that clinical manifestation and therapeutic response to pharmacological therapy are different depending on the presence of computed tomography-defined airway wall thickening in COPD patients. Defining the phenotype of COPD based on the underlying pathology is encouraging as most clinical manifestations can be distinguished by the presence of increased airway wall thickness. Pharmacological therapy has shown significant effect on COPD with airway wall thickening. However, it has limited use in COPD without an airway disease. The phenotype of COPD based on the underlying pathology can be a useful tool to better understand the disease and adjust treatment accordingly.\nDocument [3]: Title: Use of pressurized metered dose inhalers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: review of evidence. Abstract: The inhaled route is considered to be the best route to administer drugs for treating respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for both safety and efficacy. Inhalation devices are classified into four types - pressuriszed metered dose inhalers (pMDIs), dry powder inhalers, breath actuated inhalers and nebulizers. pMDIs are portable, convenient, multi-dose devices and these advantages have made them very popular with patients. They were introduced in the 1950s as the first portable, multi-dose delivery system for bronchodilators. Even though pMDIs are the most widely used devices for inhalation therapy in asthma and COPD, studies establishing their use and providing clinical data with bronchodilators and combination therapies in patients with COPD are limited. A summary of the use of pMDI with spacers in patients with COPD in terms of lung deposition and impact on lung function are presented in this review article. A review of use of the pMDI device in patients with COPD with different available and prescribed medications (bronchodilators-\u03b22-agonists and anticholinergics, and their combination with inhaled corticosteroids) is discussed.\nDocument [4]: Title: Proteomic Network Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Ex-Smokers to Discover Implicated Protein Targets and Novel Drug Treatments for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Abstract: Bronchoalveolar lavage of the epithelial lining fluid (BALF) can sample the profound changes in the airway lumen milieu prevalent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We compared the BALF proteome of ex-smokers with moderate COPD who are not in exacerbation status to non-smoking healthy control subjects and applied proteome-scale translational bioinformatics approaches to identify potential therapeutic protein targets and drugs that modulate these proteins for the treatment of COPD. Proteomic profiles of BALF were obtained from (1) never-smoker control subjects with normal lung function (n = 10) or (2) individuals with stable moderate (GOLD stage 2, FEV1 50\u221280% predicted, FEV1/FVC < 0.70) COPD who were ex-smokers for at least 1 year (n = 10). After identifying potential crucial hub proteins, drug\u2212proteome interaction signatures were ranked by the computational analysis of novel drug opportunities (CANDO) platform for multiscale therapeutic discovery to identify potentially repurposable drugs. Subsequently, a literature-based knowledge graph was utilized to rank combinations of drugs that most likely ameliorate inflammatory processes. Proteomic network analysis demonstrated that 233 of the >1800 proteins identified in the BALF were significantly differentially expressed in COPD versus control. Functional annotation of the differentially expressed proteins was used to detail canonical pathways containing the differential expressed proteins. Topological network analysis demonstrated that four putative proteins act as central node proteins in COPD. The drugs with the most similar interaction signatures to approved COPD drugs were extracted with the CANDO platform. The drugs identified using CANDO were subsequently analyzed using a knowledge-based technique to determine an optimal two-drug combination that had the most appropriate effect on the central node proteins. Network analysis of the BALF proteome identified critical targets that have critical roles in modulating COPD pathogenesis, for which we identified several drugs that could be repurposed to treat COPD using a multiscale shotgun drug discovery approach.\nDocument [5]: Title: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Useful medications for patients with recurrent symptoms. Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disorder characterised by largely irreversible changes in air flow due to irritants such as tobacco smoke. Patients with COPD experience acute exacerbations. Severe disease may progress to chronic respiratory failure. We reviewed the literature on basic medications available for COPD, using the standard Prescrire methodology. There are few clinical data on treatment of mild COPD. Regular medication is not necessary for patients who do not have recurrent symptoms. Eliminating exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritants such as workplace irritants, is the only measure known to improve the outcome of COPD. Evaluation of inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists is based mainly on short-term trials. These drugs have been shown to improve dyspnoea. Salmeterol and formoterol, two long-acting beta-2 agonists, have been extensively evaluated in symptomatic patients. Compared with no treatment, these drugs reduce breathlessness and acute exacerbations, preventing about two hospital admissions per 100 patients with moderate to severe COPD treated for 7 months. Indacaterol and olodateroldo not have a better harm-benefit balance. Inhaled beta-2 agonists occasionally provoke cardiovascular disorders. No excess mortality has been reported among the thousands of COPD patients included in clinical trials. There Is little evidence that ipratropium, an inhaled short-acting anti-muscarinic bronchodilator, improves COPD symptoms. A risk of Increased mortality among COPD patients treated with ipratroplum cannot be ruled out. Tiotroplum, an inhaled long-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilator, has been extensively evaluated In COPD. Tiotroplum has symptomatic efficacy in COPD, reducing dyspnoea and acute exacerbations. Tiotroplum had no tangible advantages over long-acting beta-2 agonists in seven randomised trials including more than 12 000 patients. Glycopyrronium and aclidinium, two other Inhaled long-acting antimuscarinics, do not appear to be more effective. Tiotroplum, like other inhaled anti-muscarinics, has antimuscarinic adverse effects including cardiac, visual and buccal disorders. Glycopyronium may carry a higher risk of serious cardiovascular effects. Combination of an antimuscarinic with an inhaled beta-2 agonist improves symptoms in 7% to 10% of patients. In patients with one or two COPD exacerbations per year, adding an Inhaled corticosterold (beclometa- sone, budesonide or fluticasone) to a long-acting beta-2 agonist prevents about 1 exacerbation during 3 to 4 years of treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids can cause pneumonia, candidiasis, dysphonia and adrenal Insufficiency. Fluticasone seems to have more adverse effects than other inhaled corticosterolds. Theophylline has uncertain efficacy on symptoms of COPD. This drug has a narrow therapeutic index and carries a risk of serious adverse effects. It should not be used in COPD. Long-term treatment with roflumilast or oral corticosteroids has an unfavourable harm-benefit balance in COPD. In practice, in 2016, the first measure in COPD is to eliminate exposure to the irritant, most often tobacco. Drugs used in COPD have only modest, mainly symptomatic efficacy. Treatment should be adapted to symptoms and the frequency of exacerbations: a short-acting beta-2 agonist should be tried first, then replaced by an inhaled long-acting bronchodilator, or possibly tiotropium, when its effect is too short-lived. An inhaled corticosteroid can be added if symptoms persist or exacerbations are frequent.\nDocument [6]: Title: Roflumilast in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: evidence from large trials. Abstract: Chronic inflammation plays a central role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Suppression of the inflammatory response is a logical approach to the treatment of COPD. Corticosteroids are highly effective as an anti-inflammatory treatment, but patients with COPD are poorly responsive to these drugs. The phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 isoenzyme is a major therapeutic target in COPD because its inhibition increases intracellular cAMP concentrations, which ultimately results in reduction of cellular inflammatory activity. At present roflumilast is the most advanced PDE-4 inhibitor undergoing clinical trials for COPD.\nDocument [7]: Title: [Diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by the presence of airflow limitation, measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after the administration of bronchodilator. Here the beta2-reversibility is defined by postbronchodilator FEV1-prebronchodilator FEV1 > 12% of pre-bronchodilator FEV1. The simple classification of disease severity into 4 stages is recommended based postbronchodilator FEV1. Bronchodilator medications are central to the symptomatic management of COPD. The principal bronchodilator treatments are beta2-agonists, anticholinergics, theophylline, and a combination of these drugs. Treatments including inhaled glucocorticosteroids are recommended to only severe COPD patients with the FEV1 < 50% predicted and to those who repeat exacerbations. Inhaled bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticosteroids are effective treatments for exacerbations of COPD. Noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation in acute exacerbations reduces mortality, decreases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and intubation, and decreases the length of hospital stay.\nDocument [8]: Title: Pulmonary hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a case for treatment. Abstract: Current pharmacotherapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) relieves symptoms and reduces exacerbation through improving airflow limitation. Such drugs do not effectively improve exercise tolerance due in part to pulmonary hypertension associated with severe COPD, nor impact on its increased morbidity and mortality. Exercise intolerance is often improved (temporarily) by lung volume reduction surgery and pulmonary rehabilitation. Ambulatory oxygen is the most effective treatment of exercise limitation. Chronic cigarette smoking is the principal cause of COPD. An early change in smokers' lungs is pulmonary artery intimal thickening and vessel narrowing, which, as COPD develops, is correlated with both the severity of emphysema and bronchiolitis. This may be the consequence of combined smoking-induced apoptosis, inflammation, and imperfect repair. End-stage bronchiolitis and emphysema are likely to limit the effectiveness of bronchodilators and corticosteroids. There are effective treatments for idiopathic and scleroderma pulmonary arterial hypertension, which increase exercise tolerance and improve survival. Because idiopathic and COPD pulmonary hypertension share a common vascular intimal thickening, excess endothelin receptor expression, and plasma endothelin-1, an important therapeutic question to address is whether an oral endothelin-1 antagonist can improve exercise tolerance in severe COPD.\nDocument [9]: Title: Future directions in the pharmacologic therapy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Abstract: Current therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) fails to alter its relentless progression. This remains a significant challenge and unmet need. A recent advance is the demonstration that treatment with a fixed dose of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist in COPD improves lung function and quality of life, and reduces exacerbation more effectively than either drug alone. Other improvements include the introduction of tiotropium, a once-daily anticholinergic. In advanced clinical development are other once-daily bronchodilators and combinations of anticholinergic drugs and beta2-agonists. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of COPD has led to novel drugs aimed at inhibiting targets, including phosphodiesterase 4, proteases, and various inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, COPD is increasingly seen as a systemic disorder or, indeed, may be a pulmonary manifestation of a complex pathophysiologic response to chronic inhalation of toxic irritants and associated with aging. Future therapy may involve better understanding of how best to target existing drugs used to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with smoking, such as atherosclerosis and hypercoagulability, and the development of new drugs that target systemic and metabolic manifestations that either result from or coexist with chronic lung inflammation, hypoxia, and cardiovascular disease in COPD.\nDocument [10]: Title: Primary care of the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-part 2: pharmacologic treatment across all stages of disease. Abstract: National guidelines for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be clarified for busy primary care practitioners who must deal with dozens of such treatment algorithms. MEDLINE searches and reviews of national evidence-based guidelines identified clinical trials and meta-analyses with relevant information on the stage-by-stage pharmacologic treatment of COPD. After formal presentations to a panel of pulmonary specialists and primary care physicians, key messages to assist in the implementation of guideline-based care in the primary care setting were identified and integrated into this article, the second in a 4-part mini-symposium. Main points of the roundtable consensus were as follows: (1) Spirometry is required for the diagnosis and staging of patients with COPD before treatment initiation; (2) all patients with COPD should be counseled to stop smoking, encouraged to start regular physical activity, and given a yearly influenza vaccination; (3) severity-based drug treatment of mild or moderate COPD, which accounts for 95% of all COPD cases, generally involves long-acting > or =1 bronchodilator because of their effectiveness and convenience; (4) patient response in terms of dyspnea, exercise ability, and side effects should be the primary guide for monitoring therapy; and (5) proper treatment of COPD can relieve patient symptoms, boost exercise capacity, reduce the number and severity of exacerbations, and improve the overall quality of life. We conclude that implementation of a relatively simple evidence-based treatment algorithm can be applied to that vast majority of the COPD population seen only in primary care.\nDocument [11]: Title: Management of dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Abstract: A progressive and debilitating illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has major worldwide impact. In addition to the care for underlying causes of disease, COPD treatment involves palliative intervention to address associated symptoms; in later stages of disease, when the underlying disease has been maximally treated, symptom management assumes primacy as the goal of care. Dyspnea is the most distressing symptom experienced by COPD patients. When dyspnea cannot be relieved by traditional COPD management strategies (i.e., \"refractory dyspnea\"), the goal of care shifts from prolonged survival to minimized symptoms, improved function, and enhanced quality of life. Numerous pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions are available to achieve these goals, but supporting evidence is variable. This review summarizes options for managing refractory dyspnea in COPD patients, referring to the available evidence and highlighting areas for further investigation. Topics include oxygen, opioids, psychotropic drugs, inhaled frusemide, Heliox28, nutrition, psychosocial support, and breathing techniques.\nDocument [12]: Title: Roflumilast: a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor for the treatment of respiratory disease. Abstract: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are two of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, yet the classes of drug licensed to treat these conditions have not changed appreciably over the last 20 years. Inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticosteroids (often in combination) form the mainstay of therapy for respiratory diseases, but many patients (including the elderly and children) can have problems using inhaler devices and there is a clear preference for oral therapy. The prevalence of these respiratory diseases is on the increase worldwide and continues to represent an area of medicine with unmet medical needs, particularly in the treatment of COPD. Despite this increase, very few new classes of drugs have been introduced into clinical practice. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors are a novel class of drugs in development for the treatment of respiratory diseases and there are a number of lead compounds in late clinical development. This review focuses on one of the most promising drugs in development, roflumilast, which has undergone extensive clinical evaluation.\nDocument [13]: Title: [Practice guideline 'Medical treatment of COPD']. Abstract: The practice guideline 'Medical treatment of COPD' completes the practice guideline for diagnostics and non-medicinal treatment. Patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and minor complaints can be treated with short-acting beta-2-adrenoceptor agonists or anticholinergics or a combination of these. In cases of insufficient clinical control of the condition or if patients use their medication for maintenance, a long-acting bronchodilator is the drug of choice. In patients with severe or very severe COPD (stage III-IV of the criteria of the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) or with cardiac comorbidity, there is a slight preference for the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce the exacerbation frequency in patients with moderate to severe or very severe COPD (GOLD stage II-IV) and recurrent exacerbations. A combination of ICS with long-acting beta-2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) is prescribed in patients with GOLD stage III-IV with at least 2 exacerbations in the past year, a deterioration of the quality of life and with symptoms, if treatment with a LABA alone or an ICS alone results in insufficient improvement. Anticholinergics and beta-2-adrenoceptor agonists have a similar effect on bronchodilation in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD. If improvement is inadequate, patients with an exacerbation should be treated with prednisolone 30 mg for a period of 7 to 14 days. In outpatients and clinical patients with an exacerbation ofCOPD, an antibiotic is added to prednisolone in very poor lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 30%) or another risk factor of a severe disease course, such as a respiratory rate > or = 30/min, a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, and disorientation in time, place or person.\nDocument [14]: Title: Current perspectives on treatment of hypertensive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Abstract: Systemic hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently coexist in the same patient, especially in the elderly. Today, a wide variety of antihypertensive drugs with different mechanisms of action are available to the prescribing physician. In addition, combination drugs for hypertension are becoming increasingly popular. Certain antihypertensive drugs can affect pulmonary function. Therefore the management of such patients can present therapeutic challenges. We have examined the literature pertaining to the use of antihypertensive drugs in patients with systemic hypertension and coexisting COPD. Although data are often limited or of poor quality, we have attempted to review and then provide recommendations regarding the use of all the specific classes of antihypertensive drug therapies including combination drugs in patients with COPD. The antihypertensive agents reviewed include diuretics, aldosterone receptor blockers, beta blockers, combined alpha and beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium channel blockers, alpha-1 blockers, centrally acting drugs, direct vasodilators, and combinations of these drugs. Of these classes, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin II antagonists appear to be the best initial choices if hypertension is the only indication for treatment. However, the limited data available on many of these drugs suggest that additional studies are needed to more precisely determine the best treatment choices in this widely prevalent patient group.\nDocument [15]: Title: Corticosteroid resistance and novel anti-inflammatory therapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: current evidence and future direction. Abstract: Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, in contrast to their use in mild-to-moderate asthma, they are much less effective in enhancing lung function and have little or no effect on controlling the underlying chronic inflammation. In most clinical trials in COPD patients, corticosteroids have shown little benefit as monotherapy, but have shown a greater clinical effect in combination with long-acting bronchodilators. Several mechanisms of corticosteroid resistance have been postulated, including a reduction in histone deacetylase (HDAC)-2 activity and expression, impaired corticosteroid activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and increased pro-inflammatory signalling pathways. Reversal of corticosteroid resistance in COPD patients by restoring HDAC2 levels has proved effective in a small study, and long-term studies are needed to determine whether novel HDAC2 activators or theophylline improve disease progression, exacerbations or mortality. Advances in the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of corticosteroid resistance in COPD pathophysiology have supported the development of new emerging classes of anti-inflammatory drugs in COPD treatment. These include treatments such as inhibitors of phosphoinositide-3-kinase-delta (PI3K\u03b4), phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and therapeutic agents such as chemokine receptor antagonists. Of these, PI3K\u03b4, PDE4, p38 MAPK inhibitors and chemokine receptor antagonists are in clinical patient trials. Of importance, patient adverse effects associated with oral administration of these novel agents needs to be addressed in order to optimize therapy and patient compliance. Combinations of these drugs with corticosteroids may have additional benefits.\nDocument [16]: Title: Impact of COPD in patients with lung cancer and advanced disease treated with chemotherapy and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Abstract: While it is relatively well known that the prognosis of patients with lung cancer (LC) treated with surgery is worse in the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it is unknown if this assessment can be extrapolated to patients with advanced disease treated with chemotherapy and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The aim of our study is to analyze the clinical characteristics and survival rates in patients with LC and COPD, and to compare these to the patients without airflow obstruction. From 471 evaluable patients, 324 (69%) were not treated with surgery due to disseminated disease (stages 3B and 4). Of them, 47.7% also had COPD. All patients were treated at the moment of diagnosis according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines with platinum-based chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Kaplan-Meier curves showed no significant differences in overall survival between COPD and non-COPD patients (log-rank P=0.65). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for the most relevant variables, the adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj) was statistically significant for performance status (HRadj =1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.59; P=0.002) and clinical stage (HRadj =0.67, 95% CI: 0.50-0.89; P=0.006), but not for COPD status (HRadj =1.20, 95% CI: 0.83-1.50; P=0.46). Our conclusion is that at present, when using standard care in advanced LC (stages 3B and 4), COPD does not have a significant deleterious impact on overall survival.\nDocument [17]: Title: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the early stage of cor pulmonale: A perspective in treatment with pulmonary arterial hypertension-approved drugs. Abstract: Cor pulmonale is right ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilation caused by pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to diseases affecting the lung function and structure. Recently, the definition of PH was revised from a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >25 mmHg to an mPAP >20 mmHg based on the Nice statement; this might expedite the detection of cor pulmonale. However, the only treatment for cor pulmonale for the past 3 decades has been to maintain the lung function and oxygen saturation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale in COPD is generally known to occur due to loss of vascular bed and chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) due to alveolar wall destruction. However, a recent study suggested that in some patients with COPD, the pulmonary vascular alterations include components that are primary lesions of the pulmonary artery. These alterations may be similar to the remodeling that occurs in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Although, there is no evidence supporting the treatment of COPD patients with PH using drugs approved for PAH, such drugs may be effective in the treatment of a selected group of COPD patients, whose disease includes PAH-like vascular components. To distinguish these patients, it is necessary to understand the histopathology of COPD and renew our understanding of the concept of cor pulmonale, which treats the heart and lung as a single unit. Herein, we review the recent histopathological concepts of COPD with respect to the progression of cor pulmonale.\nDocument [18]: Title: What is in the guidelines about the pharmacological treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Abstract: With the publication of the new guidelines (The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2011 and Gu\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola de la COPD) on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the pharmacological treatment of this disease has changed substantially. In this article, the evidence supporting the use of pharmacological groups in COPD is summarized and the place of each of these drugs among the new therapeutic strategies is established. Although short-acting bronchodilators have been used as maintenance therapy for COPD for many years, few clinical trials are available on the efficacy and safety of these agents, whose role was defined at the very early stages of treatment. The introduction of long-acting bronchodilators, administered every 12 or 24 h, led to an increase in therapeutic effects and an improvement in both treatment adherence and dosage; therefore, both guidelines consider these drugs as the standard therapy for all types of patients and clinical phenotypes. The combination of long-acting bronchodilators from different families has been established as a new therapeutic approach for patients with persistent symptoms despite an appropriate bronchodilator treatment. Anti-inflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids has been discussed at length, and is considered in the current guidelines as the treatment of choice in patients with a high risk of exacerbations associated with an impaired lung function or previous exacerbations, or presenting with phenotypes that are susceptible to the effect of corticosteroids. Roflumilast is a novel drug with a clearly defined indication. Finally, further evidence about other therapies, such as antibiotics or mucolytics, is emerging that will help define their appropriate use in selected patients. At present, pharmacological management of COPD is being re-evaluated. As long as we are able to apply the new treatment approaches to the clinical reality of our patients we will achieve greater benefits in both the short and the long term with a reduction in potential complications.\nDocument [19]: Title: [Current position of new fixed-dose combination of tiotropium and olodaterol - its role in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Czech Republic]. Abstract: COPD is a serious pulmonary disease with rising global socioeconomic impact. From the perspective of the Czech Republic COPD was responsible for 21 000 acute hospitalizations and 3 500 deaths, mortality reaches 33/100 000 in 2015. Early stages of disease may be associated with a significant reduction of exercise capacity and the reduction of activities of daily living. Moreover early stages of bronchial obstruction are associated with the fastest lung function decline. Finally, early elimination of the risk of inhalation exposure is able to influence the course of the disease and to reduce its mortality. Most current treatment strategies and national recommendations attributed central role to bronchodilator drugs. Long-acting bronchodilators (LAMA and LABA) creates an essential component of the treatment of symptomatic individuals in the Czech COPD guidelines as well. Actual version of this document constitutes as standard therapy: long-lasting inhaled bronchodilators, targeted efforts to eliminate inhalation risk, vaccination, regular exercise, repeated inhalation technique training, identification, and treatment of relevant comorbidities. All other drugs (inhaled-corticosteroids, mucoactive medication, roflumilast, antibiotics), and non-pharmacological (lung volume reductions, nutrition support, long-term oxygen, home non-invasive ventilation, lung transplantation, palliative care) procedures are intended for a specific subgroups of patients only. The newest type of bronchodilator therapy is represented by a fixed dual bronchodilation. Currently we can use four original drug combinations: titropium + olodaterol, glycopyrronium + indacaterol, umeklidinium + vilanterol and aclidinium + formoterol in the Czech Republic. This area is an enterprising research. For example comprehensive scientific program covering eight studies on 15 000 COPD patients (TOviTO) assess the therapeutic benefits of tiotropium + olodaterolu in terms of lung function, quality of life, exercise tolerance, daily physical activity and the incidence of acute exacerbations. Meanwhile the published results of analyzed studies TONADO, OTEMTO, VIVACITO, and the first results of the study DYNAGITO have showed that fixed dual bronchodilation should be a mandatory treatment to all the symptomatic COPD patients. Unfortunately \"face to face\" comparison of different drug combinations is still missing. However, the treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol combination has been demonstrated to significantly (35 %) reduce the occurrence of clinically significant deterioration, which may lead to the stabilization of this multicomponent disease.Key words: COPD - hospitalizations - inhaled bronchodilators - mortality - treatment.\nDocument [20]: Title: Generation of a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Model in Mice by Repeated Ozone Exposure. Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and lung parenchymal destruction. It has a very high incidence in aging populations. The current conventional therapies for COPD focus mainly on symptom-modifying drugs; thus, the development of new therapies is urgently needed. Qualified animal models of COPD could help to characterize the underlying mechanisms and can be used for new drug screening. Current COPD models, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced emphysema model, generate COPD-like lesions in the lungs and airways but do not otherwise resemble the pathogenesis of human COPD. A cigarette smoke (CS)-induced model remains one of the most popular because it not only simulates COPD-like lesions in the respiratory system, but it is also based on one of the main hazardous materials that causes COPD in humans. However, the time-consuming and labor-intensive aspects of the CS-induced model dramatically limit its application in new drug screening. In this study, we successfully generated a new COPD model by exposing mice to high levels of ozone. This model demonstrated the following: 1) decreased forced expiratory volume 25, 50, and 75/forced vital capacity (FEV25/FVC, FEV50/FVC, and FEV75/FVC), indicating the deterioration of lung function; 2) enlarged lung alveoli, with lung parenchymal destruction; 3) reduced fatigue time and distance; and 4) increased inflammation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the ozone exposure (OE) model is a reliable animal model that is similar to humans because ozone overexposure is one of the etiological factors of COPD. Additionally, it only took 6 - 8 weeks, based on our previous work, to create an OE model, whereas it requires 3 - 12 months to induce the cigarette smoke model, indicating that the OE model might be a good choice for COPD research.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Research with animal models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis has shown that use of a topical corticosteroid alone against an established infection can significantly increase the number of colonizing bacteria or worsen clinical disease. Moreover, retrospective analysis has suggested that corticosteroid use in humans is associated with an increased risk of keratitis in eyes with pre-existing disease. Thus, while corticosteroids are often used to reduce ocular inflammation in the absence of infection, the risk of opportunistic infection remains a concern. However, the effect of corticosteroids on the intrinsic barrier function of uninfected corneas is unknown. Here, we tested if short-term topical corticosteroid treatment of an uninfected murine cornea would increase susceptibility to P. aeruginosa colonization or infection after epithelial injury. Topical prednisolone acetate (1%) was administered to one eye of C57BL/6 mice three times a day for 3 days; control eyes were treated with sterile PBS. Prior to inoculation with a cytotoxic P. aeruginosa corneal isolate strain 6206, corneas were subject to superficial-injury by tissue paper blotting, or scratch-injured followed by 12 h of healing. Previously we have shown that blotting renders mouse corneas susceptible to P. aeruginosa adhesion, but not infection, while 12 h healing reduces susceptibility to infection after scratching. Corneas were evaluated at 48 h for bacterial colonization and microbial keratitis (MK). To monitor impact on wound healing, corneal integrity was examined by fluorescein staining immediately after scarification and after 12 h healing. For both the tissue paper blotting and scratch-injury models, there was no significant difference in P. aeruginosa colonization at 48 h between corticosteroid-pretreated eyes and controls. With the blotting model, one case of MK was observed in a control (PBS-pretreated) cornea; none in corticosteroid-pretreated corneas. With the 12 h healing model, MK occurred in 6 of 17 corticosteroid-pretreated eyes versus 2 of 17 controls, a difference not statistically significant. Corticosteroid-pretreated eyes showed greater fluorescein staining 12 h after scarification injury, but this did not coincide with increased colonization or MK. Together, these data show that short-term topical corticosteroid therapy on an uninfected murine cornea does not necessarily enhance its susceptibility to P. aeruginosa colonization or infection after injury, even when it induces fluorescein staining.\nDocument [2]: Title: Experimental modeling of cornea wound healing in diabetes: clinical applications and beyond. Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of blindness in working age populations worldwide. While much of the focus for public health has been on secondary prevention in sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy, the cornea, including its epithelium and nerves, represents a major site of damage by chronic hyperglycemia. On injury, the diabetic cornea exhibits a delayed wound-healing response, as well as an altered ocular surface immune response. This suggests a potential association between the dysfunctional wound healing response and altered inflammation on the ocular surface. However, the presence of potential confounders makes this association difficult to investigate in human epidemiological studies. Thus, we turn to animal diabetic models for a better understanding. In this review, 20 original studies, published between 2008 and 2018, describe in vivo and in vitro models of diabetic cornea disease. We compared different models of diabetic cornea wound healing and discussed the relative strengths and drawbacks of each model. A number of molecular and cellular components involved in the corneal wound healing response that are altered in the presence of diabetes have been identified in the reviewed studies. Particularly, altered corneal epithelial protein concentrations of lumician and occludin were detected in diabetic eyes compared with controls. Additionally, the importance of IL-1\u03b2 in modulating the inflammatory response after corneal injury in patients with diabetes and controls was further elucidated. Meanwhile, abnormal P2\u00d77 receptor localization and decreased corneal sub-basal nerve density in diabetic eyes were shown to contribute to altered corneal nerve signaling after injury and thus affecting the wound healing response. Finally, the discovery of the therapeutic effects of topically administered aloe vera, Serpine 1, Resolvin D1 (RvD1), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn in diabetic animal models of cornea epithelial and nerve injury provide encouraging evidence for the future availability of effective treatment for diabetic keratopathy.\nDocument [3]: Title: Neurotrophic Keratopathy: Ophthalmology's Diabetic Foot Problem. Abstract: This article summarizes key elements of the 2020 Harold A. Stein Lecture presented at the Eye and Contact Lens Special Symposium \"Healing the Ocular Surface: What's New for Neurotrophic Keratitis.\" The major point that I made in this talk is that we need to think about neurotrophic keratopathy as ophthalmology's diabetic foot problem; as a chronic condition that is, often best managed by prevention. Neurotrophic keratopathy is not primarily an inflammatory condition, as suggested by the term \u201fneurotrophic keratitis.\" The epitheliopathy in this condition is a consequence of the dysregulated epithelial cell migration, differentiation, and homeostasis that occurs with denervation of the ocular surface. Although this epitheliopathy may be complicated by poor lid closure, or rarely, aqueous tear deficiency, most of these eyes are not dry and do not require exogenous lubrication for comfort, prophylaxis, or healing. The use of topical agents in these eyes inevitably leads to unrecognized iatrogenic injury, with poor outcomes because of inherently poor wound healing and delays in seeking medical care. Tarsorrhaphy is a time-honored method of protecting the neurotrophic cornea, shielding the eye from iatrogenic injury. Alternative methods for protecting the \u201fat risk\" surface of the neurotrophic cornea include patient education, minimizing topical agents, and the use of protective eyewear.\nDocument [4]: Title: Corneal Epithelial Abrasion with Ocular Burr As a Model for Cornea Wound Healing. Abstract: The murine cornea provides an excellent model to study wound healing. The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye, and thus is the first defense to injury. In fact, the most common type of eye injury found in clinic is a corneal abrasion. Here, we utilize an ocular burr to induce an abrasion resulting in removal of the corneal epithelium in vivo on anesthetized mice. This method allows for targeted and reproducible epithelial disruption, leaving other areas intact. In addition, we describe the visualization of the abraded epithelium with fluorescein staining and provide concrete advice on how to visualize the abraded cornea. Then, we follow the timeline of wound healing 0, 18, and 72 h after abrasion, until the wound is re-epithelialized. The epithelial abrasion model of corneal injury is ideal for studies on epithelial cell proliferation, migration and re-epithelialization of the corneal layers. However, this method is not optimal to study stromal activation during wound healing, because the ocular burr does not penetrate to the stromal cell layers. This method is also suitable for clinical applications, for example, pre-clinical test of drug effectiveness.\nDocument [5]: Title: Long term observation of ocular surface alkali burn in rabbit models: Quantitative analysis of corneal haze, vascularity and self-recovery. Abstract: Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency (LSCD), caused due to corneal injury, primarily by chemical/alkali burns, leads to compromised vision. Recently, several animal models of corneal alkali burn injury have become available. The majority of the studies with these animal models start interventions soon after the injury. However, in the clinical setting, there is a considerable delay before the intervention is initiated. Detailed knowledge of the molecular, histopathological, and clinical parameters associated with the progression of the injury leading to LSCD is highly desirable. In this context, we set out to investigate clinical, histopathological parameters of ocular surface alkali burn over a long period of time, post-injury. Limbal stem cell-deficient animal models of rabbits were created by alkali burn using sodium hydroxide, which was then assessed for their progression towards LSCD by grading the alkali burn, corneal haze, and vascularization. Additionally, cells present on the corneal surface after the burn was investigated by histology and immunophenotyping. Grading of rabbit eyes post-alkali burn had shown complete conjunctivalization in 80% (n = 12/15) of the rabbits with the alkali burn grade score of 3.88 \u00b1 0.29 in three months and remained stable at four months (4.12 \u00b1 0.24). However, ocular surface showed self-healing in 20% (n = 3/15) of the rabbits with a score of 1.67 \u00b1 0.34 in four months irrespective of similar alkali injury. These self-healing corneas exhibited decreased opacity score from 2.51 \u00b1 0.39 to 0.66 \u00b1 0.22 (p = 0.002) and regressed vascularity from 1.66 \u00b1 0.41 to 0.66 \u00b1 0.33 in one to nine months, respectively. Restoration of the corneal phenotype (CK3+) was observed in central and mid-peripheral regions of the self-healing corneas, and histology revealed the localization of inflammatory cells to the peripheral cornea when compared to conjunctivalized and scarred LSCD eyes. Our study shows the essentiality to consider the time required for surgical intervention after the corneal alkali injury in rabbit models as evident from their tendency to self-heal and restore corneal phenotype without therapy. Such information on the possibility of self-healing should be useful in further studies as well as determining interventional timings and strategy during clinical presentation of corneal alkali burns.\nDocument [6]: Title: The healing of alkali-injured cornea is stimulated by a novel matrix regenerating agent (RGTA, CACICOL20): a biopolymer mimicking heparan sulfates reducing proteolytic, oxidative and nitrosative damage. Abstract: The efficacy of a chemically modified dextran - heparan sulfate mimicking regenerating agent (RGTA) on the healing of the rabbit cornea injured with alkali was examined. The eyes were injured with 0.15 N NaOH applied on the cornea or with 1.0 N NaOH using a 8 mm diameter filter paper disk. Then RGTA or placebo was applied on the cornea. In the last group of rabbits, corneas injured with the high alkali concentration were left without any treatment for four weeks; subsequently, the corneas were treated with RGTA or placebo. The central corneal thickness was measured using a pachymeter. The corneas were examined morphologically, immunohistochemically and for real time-PCR. Compared to control (unaffected) corneas, following the application of low alkali concentration the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, metalloproteinase 9, nitric oxide synthase and xanthine oxidase was increased in the injured corneal epithelium of placebo-treated eyes, whereas the expression of antioxidant enzymes was reduced. Nitrotyrosine and malondialdehyde stainings appeared in the corneal epithelium. RGTA application suppressed the antioxidant/prooxidant imbalance and reduced the expression of the above-mentioned immunohistochemical markers. The corneal thickness increased after alkali injury, decreased during corneal healing after RGTA treatment faster than after placebo application. Following the injury with the high alkali concentration, corneal inflammation and neovascularization were highly pronounced in placebo-treated corneas, whereas in RGTA-treated corneas they were significantly supressed. When RGTA or placebo application was started later after alkali injury and corneas were ulcerated, subsequent RGTA treatment healed the majority of them. In conclusion, RGTA facilitates the healing of injured corneas via a reduction of proteolytic, oxidative and nitrosative damage.\nDocument [7]: Title: Inflammation Confers Healing Advantage to Corneal Epithelium Following Subsequent Injury. Abstract: Recent evidence shows that epithelial stem/progenitor cells in barrier tissues such as the skin, airways and intestines retain a memory of previous injuries, which enables tissues to accelerate barrier restoration after subsequent injuries. The corneal epithelium, the outermost layer of the cornea, is the frontline barrier for the eye and is maintained by epithelial stem/progenitor cells in the limbus. Herein, we provide evidence that inflammatory memory also exists in the cornea. In mice, eyes that had been exposed to corneal epithelial injury exhibited faster re-epithelialization of the cornea and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines following subsequent injury (either the same or a different type of injury) relative to na\u00efve eyes without previous injury. In ocular Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients, corneal punctate epithelial erosions were significantly reduced after experiencing infectious injury compared with before. These results demonstrate that previous exposure of the corneal epithelium to inflammatory stimuli enhances corneal wound healing in response to a secondary assault, a phenomenon which points to the presence of nonspecific inflammatory memory in the cornea.\nDocument [8]: Title: Germinal peptide eye drops promote corneal wound healing and decrease inflammation after alkali injury. Abstract: Germinal peptide is being developed to treat corneal injuries. The purpose of this study was to investigate its effect on corneal epithelial cells in vitro and its ability to promote healing in an alkali injury model in vivo. Cultured rabbit corneal epithelial cells were treated with germinal peptide at three concentrations. Cell proliferation and migration were assessed and compared with the effect of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rh-EGF). In vivo, the corneas of New Zealand albino rabbits were chemically burned with 1 mol/l NaOH for 30 s. The injured eyes were topically treated with germinal peptide (10, 20, and 40 \u03bcg/ml), rh-EGF, or phosphate-buffered saline thrice daily. At fixed time points post injury, the healing of the cornea and its histopathology were evaluated. There was no difference in the effect of germinal peptide on cultured cell proliferation. However, cell migration was significantly higher than that in the control groups, with germinal peptide at concentrations of 20 and 40 \u03bcg/ml being the most efficacious. In vivo, 20 and 40 \u03bcg/ml germinal peptide significantly alleviated corneal opacity and edema. By day 21, the areas of corneal neovascularization in the germinal peptide-treated groups were smaller than those in the rh-EGF and control groups. The repaired corneas in the germinal peptide- and rh-EGF-treated groups also had more corneal epithelial layers and fewer inflammatory cells than the controls. Germinal peptide may be developed as a novel topical treatment agent for corneal wound healing in clinical settings.\nDocument [9]: Title: Role of aquaporins in corneal healing post chemical injury. Abstract: Aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane water channel proteins that regulate the movement of water through the plasma membrane in various tissues including cornea. The cornea is avascular and has specialized microcirculatory mechanisms for homeostasis. AQPs regulate corneal hydration and transparency for normal vision. Currently, there are 13 known isoforms of AQPs that can be subclassified as orthodox AQPs, aquaglyceroporins (AQGPs), or supraquaporins (SAQPs)/unorthodox AQPs. AQPs are implicated in keratocyte function, inflammation, edema, angiogenesis, microvessel proliferation, and the wound-healing process in the cornea. AQPs play an important role in wound healing by facilitating the movement of corneal stromal keratocytes by squeezing through tight stromal matrix and narrow extracellular spaces to the wound site. Deficiency of AQPs can cause reduced concentration of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) leading to reduced epithelial proliferation, reduced/impaired keratocyte migration, reduced number of keratocytes in the injury site, delayed and abnormal wound healing process. Dysregulated AQPs cause dysfunction in osmolar homeostasis as well as wound healing mechanisms. The cornea is a transparent avascular tissue that constitutes the anterior aspect of the outer covering of the eye and aids in two-thirds of visual light refraction. Being the outermost layer of the eye, the cornea is prone to injury. Of the 13 AQP isoforms, AQP1 is expressed in the stromal keratocytes and endothelial cells, and AQP3 and AQP5 are expressed in epithelial cells in the human cornea. AQPs can facilitate wound healing through aid in cellular migration, proliferation, migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and autophagy mechanism. Corneal wound healing post-chemical injury requires an integrative and coordinated activity of the epithelium, stromal keratocytes, endothelium, ECM, and a battery of cytokines and growth factors to restore corneal transparency. If the chemical injury is mild, the cornea will heal with normal clarity, but severe injuries can lead to partial and/or permanent loss of corneal functions. Currently, the role of AQPs in corneal wound healing is poorly understood in the context of chemical injury. This review discusses the current literature and the role of AQPs in corneal homeostasis, wound repair, and potential therapeutic target for acute and chronic corneal injuries.\nDocument [10]: Title: Evaluation and management of corneal abrasions. Abstract: Corneal abrasions are commonly encountered in primary care. Patients typically present with a history of trauma and symptoms of foreign body sensation, tearing, and sensitivity to light. History and physical examination should exclude serious causes of eye pain, including penetrating injury, infective keratitis, and corneal ulcers. After fluorescein staining of the cornea, an abrasion will appear yellow under normal light and green in cobalt blue light. Physicians should carefully examine for foreign bodies and remove them, if present. The goals of treatment include pain control, prevention of infection, and healing. Pain relief may be achieved with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral analgesics. Evidence does not support the use of topical cycloplegics for uncomplicated corneal abrasions. Patching is not recommended because it does not improve pain and has the potential to delay healing. Although evidence is lacking, topical antibiotics are commonly prescribed to prevent bacterial superinfection. Contact lens-related abrasions should be treated with antipseudomonal topical antibiotics. Follow-up may not be necessary for patients with small (4 mm or less), uncomplicated abrasions; normal vision; and resolving symptoms. All other patients should be reevaluated in 24 hours. Referral is indicated for any patient with symptoms that do not improve or that worsen, a corneal infiltrate or ulcer, significant vision loss, or a penetrating eye injury.\nDocument [11]: Title: The chicken cornea as a model of wound healing and neuronal re-innervation. Abstract: The cornea is the major refractive component of the eye and serves as a barrier to the external environment. Understanding how the cornea responds to injury is important to developing therapies to treat vision disorders that affect the integrity and refractive properties of the cornea. Thus, investigation of the wound healing responses of the cornea to injury in a cost-effective animal model is a valuable tool for research. This study characterizes the wound healing responses in the corneas of White Leghorn chicken.\nDocument [12]: Title: Molecular Hydrogen Effectively Heals Alkali-Injured Cornea via Suppression of Oxidative Stress. Abstract: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) on the healing of alkali-injured cornea. The effects of the solution of H<sub>2</sub> in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or PBS alone topically applied on the alkali-injured rabbit cornea with 0.25&#8201;M NaOH were investigated using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods. Central corneal thickness taken as an index of corneal hydration was measured with an ultrasonic pachymeter. Results show that irrigation of the damaged eyes with H<sub>2</sub> solution immediately after the injury and then within next five days renewed corneal transparency lost after the injury and reduced corneal hydration increased after the injury to physiological levels within ten days after the injury. In contrast, in injured corneas treated with PBS, the transparency of damaged corneas remained lost and corneal hydration elevated. Later results-on day 20 after the injury-showed that in alkali-injured corneas treated with H<sub>2</sub> solution the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, peroxynitrite, detected by nitrotyrosine residues (NT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expressions were very low or absent compared to PBS treated injured corneas, where NT and MDA expressions were present. In conclusion, H<sub>2</sub> solution favorably influenced corneal healing after alkali injury via suppression of oxidative stress.\nDocument [13]: Title: Corneal and Limbal Alkali Injury Induction Using a Punch-Trephine Technique in a Mouse Model. Abstract: The cornea is critical for vision, and corneal healing after trauma is fundamental in maintaining its transparency and function. Through the study of corneal injury models, researchers aim to enhance their understanding of how the cornea heals and develop strategies to prevent and manage corneal opacities. Chemical injury is one of the most popular injury models that has extensively been studied on mice. Most previous investigators have used a flat paper soaked in sodium hydroxide to induce corneal injury. However, inducing corneal and limbal injury using flat filter paper is unreliable, since the mouse cornea is highly curved. Here, we present a new instrument, a modified biopsy punch, that enables the researchers to create a well-circumscribed, localized, and evenly distributed alkali injury to the murine cornea and limbus. This punch-trephine method enables researchers to induce an accurate and reproducible chemical burn to the entire murine cornea and limbus while leaving other structures, such as the eyelids, unaffected by the chemical. Moreover, this study introduces an enucleation technique that preserves the medial caruncle as a landmark for identifying the nasal side of the globe. The bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, and lacrimal gland are also kept intact using this technique. Ophthalmologic examinations were performed via slit lamp biomicroscope and fluorescein staining on days 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and 14 post-injury. Clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical findings confirmed limbal stem cell deficiency and ocular surface regeneration failure in all experimental mice. The presented alkali corneal injury model is ideal for studying limbal stem cell deficiency, corneal inflammation, and fibrosis. This method is also suitable for investigating pre-clinical and clinical efficacies of topical ophthalmologic medications on the murine corneal surface.\nDocument [14]: Title: Impaired healing of cornea incision injury in a TRPV1-deficient mouse. Abstract: The present study attempts to elucidate the role of TRPV1 cation channel receptor on primary repair in an incision-wounded mouse cornea in vivo. Previous study revealed that blocking TRPV1 suppressed myofibroblast formation and expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) in cultured keratocytes or ocular fibroblasts. Male C57BL/6 (wild-type; WT) mice and male C57BL/6 Trpv1-null (KO) mice incurred a full-thickness incision injury (1.8 mm in length, limbus to limbus) in the central cornea of one eye with a surgical blade under general and topical anesthesia. The injury was not sutured. On days 0, 5, and 10, the eyes were enucleated, processed for histology, immunohistochemistry, and real-time RT-PCR gene expression analysis to evaluate the effects of the loss of TRPV1 on primary healing. Electron microscopy observation was also performed to know the effect of the loss of TRPV1 on ultrastructure of keratocytes. The results showed that the loss of Trpv1 gene delayed closure of corneal stromal incision with hindered myofibroblast transdifferentiation along with declines in the expression of collagen Ia1 and TGF\u03b21. Inflammatory cell infiltration was not affected by the loss of TRPV1. Ultrastructurally endoplasmic reticulum of TRPV1-null keratocytes was more extensively dilated as compared with WT keratocytes, suggesting an impairment of protein secretion by TRPV1-gene knockout. These results indicate that injury-related TRPV1 signal is involved in healing of stromal incision injury in a mouse cornea by selectively stimulating TGF\u03b2-induced granulation tissue formation.\nDocument [15]: Title: IL-20 promotes epithelial healing of the injured mouse cornea. Abstract: After corneal epithelial injury, the ensuing inflammatory response is necessary for efficient wound healing. While beneficial healing effects are attributed to recruited neutrophils and platelets, dysregulated inflammation (too little or too much) is associated with impaired wound healing. The purpose of this study was to use an established C57BL/6J mouse model of corneal injury to evaluate the potential modulatory role of interleukin-20 (IL-20) on the inflammatory and healing responses to epithelial wounding. In the uninjured cornea, immunofluorescence staining for IL-20 and its receptor, IL-20RA, was observed on basal epithelial cells at the limbus. After a 2 mm central epithelial abrasion, IL-20 staining was also observed in stromal keratocytes and ELISA studies showed a significant increase (nearly 3-fold) in IL-20 expression. Injured corneas healed more slowly when treated with a topical application of a neutralizing anti-IL-20 antibody. While corneal epithelial cell division and epithelial nerve recovery measured at 24 h post-injury were reduced compared to controls, neutrophil influx into the cornea was increased. In contrast, topical application of recombinant IL-20 (rIL-20) decreased corneal inflammation as evidenced by reductions in limbal vessel dilatation, platelet extravasation, neutrophil recruitment and CXCL1 expression. In wild type mice, topical rIL-20 had a limited effect on corneal wound healing and resulted in only a slight increase in epithelial cell division and epithelial nerve recovery; the rate of wound closure was unaffected. To clarify the effect of IL-20 on corneal wound healing, rIL-20 was topically applied to neutropenic wild type (WT) mice and mutant mice (\u0263\u03b4 T cell deficient mice and CD11a deficient mice), all of which have well characterized reductions in neutrophil recruitment and delayed wound healing after corneal injury. In each case, rIL-20 restored corneal wound healing to baseline levels while neutrophil recruitment remained low. Thus, it appears that IL-20 plays a beneficial and direct role in corneal wound healing while negatively regulating neutrophil and platelet infiltration.\nDocument [16]: Title: An Epithelial Abrasion Model for Studying Corneal Wound Healing. Abstract: The cornea is critical for vision, accounting for about two-thirds of the refractive power of the eye. Crucial to the role of the cornea in vision is its transparency. However, due to its external position, the cornea is highly susceptible to a wide variety of injuries that can lead to the loss of corneal transparency and eventual blindness. Efficient corneal wound healing in response to these injuries is pivotal for maintaining corneal homeostasis and preservation of corneal transparency and refractive capabilities. In events of compromised corneal wound healing, the cornea becomes vulnerable to infections, ulcerations, and scarring. Given the fundamental importance of corneal wound healing to the preservation of corneal transparency and vision, a better understanding of the normal corneal wound healing process is a prerequisite to understanding impaired corneal wound healing associated with infection and disease. Toward this goal, murine models of corneal wounding have proven useful in furthering our understanding of the corneal wound healing mechanisms operating under normal physiological conditions. Here, a protocol for creating a central corneal epithelial abrasion in mouse using a trephine and a blunt golf club spud is described. In this model, a 2 mm diameter circular trephine, centered over the cornea, is used to demarcate the wound area. The golf club spud is used with care to debride the epithelium and create a circular wound without damaging the corneal epithelial basement membrane. The resulting inflammatory response proceeds as a well-characterized cascade of cellular and molecular events that are critical for efficient wound healing. This simple corneal wound healing model is highly reproducible and well-published and is now being used to evaluate compromised corneal wound healing in the context of disease.\nDocument [17]: Title: Biomaterials and controlled release strategy for epithelial wound healing. Abstract: The skin and cornea are tissues that provide protective functions. Trauma and other environmental threats often cause injuries, infections and damage to these tissues, where the degree of injury is directly correlated to the recovery time. For example, a superficial skin or corneal wound may recover within days; however, more severe injuries can last up to several months and may leave scarring. Thus, therapeutic strategies have been introduced to enhance the wound healing efficiency and quality. Although the skin and cornea share similar anatomic structures and wound healing process, therapeutic agents and formulations for skin and cornea wound healing differ in accordance with the tissue and wound type. In this review, we describe the anatomy and epithelial wound healing processes of the skin and cornea, and summarize the therapeutic molecules that are beneficial to the respective regeneration process. In addition, biomaterial scaffolds that inherently possess bioactive properties or modified with therapeutic molecules for topical controlled release and enhanced wound healing efficiency are also discussed.\nDocument [18]: Title: MG53 promotes corneal wound healing and mitigates fibrotic remodeling in rodents. Abstract: The cornea plays an important role in transmitting light and providing protection to the eye, but is susceptible to injury and infection. Standard treatments for corneal wounds include topical lubricants, antibiotics, bandage contact lens, and surgery. However, these measures are often ineffective. Here we show that MG53, a protein with an essential role in cell membrane repair, contributes to the corneal injury-repair process. Native MG53 is present in the corneal epithelia, tear film, and aqueous humor, suggesting its potential function in corneal homeostasis. Knockout of MG53 in mice causes impaired healing and regenerative capacity following injury. Exogenous recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein protects the corneal epithelia against mechanical injury and enhances healing by promoting migration of corneal fibroblasts. Using in vivo alkaline-induced injury to the rat cornea, we show that rhMG53 promotes re-epithelialization and reduces post-injury fibrosis and vascularization. Finally, we show that rhMG53 modulates TGF-\u03b2-mediated fibrotic remodeling associated with corneal injury. Overall, our data support the bi-functional role of MG53 in facilitating corneal healing and maintaining corneal transparency by reducing fibrosis and vascularization associated with corneal injuries.\nDocument [19]: Title: Effect of fluoroquinolones on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase in debrided cornea of rats. Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in regenerative and healing processes in corneal injuries. Based upon reports that topical fluoroquinolones (FQs) may cause perforations during corneal healing by modulating MMPs, this study evaluated the comparative effects of commercially available FQs eye drops on the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the cornea after ethanol injury. Uniform corneal epithelial defects were created using 70% ethanol in the right eye of the rats (n = 6). The groups studied were (I) sham, (II) normal saline with benzalkonium chloride (NS-BKC), (III) norfloxacin 0.3%, (IV) ciprofloxacin 0.3%, (V) lomefloxacin 0.3%, (VI) sparfloxacin 0.3%, (VII) gatifloxacin 0.3%, and (VIII) moxifloxacin 0.5%. Each treatment was instilled six times/day up to 48 h and rats were sacrificed using excess of anesthesia. The corneas were excised to study the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 using gelatin zymography and real-time PCR. All the FQs significantly increased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 as compared to the sham and NS-BKC-treated group. NS-BKC did not show a significant effect on MMPs expression compared to the sham group. Among the studied FQs, ciprofloxacin was observed to exhibit maximal induction of MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas lomefloxacin exhibited an equivocal effect on both MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Findings of the present study demonstrate that topical application of FQs may induce the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in debrided corneal epithelium and, therefore, may delay corneal wound healing. Thus, it can be concluded that selecting a FQ for ophthalmic use having minimal effect on MMPs may impact wound healing in injured or vulnerable cornea.\nDocument [20]: Title: Recovery of Corneal Sensitivity and Increase in Nerve Density and Wound Healing in Diabetic Mice After PEDF Plus DHA Treatment. Abstract: Diabetic keratopathy decreases corneal sensation and tear secretion and delays wound healing after injury. In the current study, we tested the effect of treatment with pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in combination with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on corneal nerve regeneration in a mouse model of diabetes with or without corneal injury. The study was performed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (C57BL/6). Ten weeks after streptozotocin injection, diabetic mice showed significant decreases of corneal sensitivity, tear production, and epithelial subbasal nerve density when compared with age-matched normal mice. After diabetic mice were wounded in the right eye and treated in both eyes with PEDF+DHA for 2 weeks, there was a significant increase in corneal epithelial nerve regeneration and substance P-positive nerve density in both wounded and unwounded eyes compared with vehicle-treated corneas. There also was elevated corneal sensitivity and tear production in the treated corneas compared with vehicle. In addition, PEDF+DHA accelerated corneal wound healing, selectively recruited type 2 macrophages, and prevented neutrophil infiltration in diabetic wounded corneas. These results suggest that topical treatment with PEDF+DHA promotes corneal nerve regeneration and wound healing in diabetic mice and could potentially be exploited as a therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetic keratopathy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) gastritis could cause dyspepsia, and eradication is recommended as the first-line treatment. Patients who continuously have their symptoms under control > 6 months after eradication are defined as having H. pylori-associated dyspepsia (HPD), whereas patients who do not benefit from successful eradication are defined as having functional dyspepsia.\nDocument [2]: Title: Functional Dyspepsia: Evaluation and Management. Abstract: Functional dyspepsia is defined as at least one month of epigastric discomfort without evidence of organic disease found during an upper endoscopy, and it accounts for 70% of dyspepsia. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia include postprandial fullness, early satiety, and epigastric pain or burning. Functional dyspepsia is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, evaluation for a more serious disease such as an upper gastrointestinal malignancy is warranted. Individual alarm symptoms do not correlate with malignancy for patients younger than 60 years, and endoscopy is not necessarily warranted but should be considered for patients with severe or multiple alarm symptoms. For patients younger than 60 years, a test and treat strategy for Helicobacter pylori is recommended before acid suppression therapy. For patients 60 years or older, upper endoscopy should be performed. All patients should be advised to limit foods associated with increased symptoms of dyspepsia; a diet low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) is suggested. Eight weeks of acid suppression therapy is recommended for patients who test negative for H. pylori, or who continue to have symptoms after H. pylori eradication. If acid suppression does not alleviate symptoms, patients should be treated with tricyclic antidepressants followed by prokinetics and psychological therapy. The routine use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies has not shown evidence of effectiveness and is not recommended.\nDocument [3]: Title: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings and prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among adult patients with dyspepsia in northern Tanzania. Abstract: Dyspepsia is a common presenting complaint of various upper gastrointestinal disorders. The symptoms of causes of dyspepsia often overlap and this makes etiological diagnosis difficult. Endoscopy is the ideal procedure for identifying organic diseases of the foregut. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with various upper gastrointestinal pathologies. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine endoscopic findings and H. pylori status in two hundred and eight consecutive dyspeptic adult patients between June 2009 and April 2010 at Kilimanjaro Christian medical Centre, a referral and teaching hospital in northern Tanzania. The most commonly identified endoscopic findings were gastritis (61.10%), Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (57%), and Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) (24.1%). Gastric cancer was identified in 6.7% of patients and all of them were aged 40 years and above (p = 0.00). H. pylori infection was detected in 65% (n = 130) of patients. H. pylori infection was present in 57% (n = 24) of patients who were tested within six months after eradication therapy. Gastritis and duodenal ulcer were statistically significantly associated with H. pylori (p < 0.001). No association was found between GERD and H. pylori infection (p > 0.05). Gastritis, GERD, and PUD are the leading causes of dyspepsia. H. pylori infection is present in significant proportion of dyspeptic patients. Patients with Gastritis and PUD should undergo empirical eradication therapy if a confirmatory test is not available. Patients with dyspepsia who are over 40 years of age should undergo Endoscopy (EGD) for initial work up. Study on antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of H. pylori is recommended to guide choices for evidence based treatment option.\nDocument [4]: Title: The management of univestigated dyspepsia in primary care. Abstract: Dyspepsia is very common in western countries, where 10-40% of the population experience upper abdominal pain or discomfort over the course of one year. Mostly it is a chronic relapsing problem. Prompt endoscopy is imperative in all patients with sinister symptoms (including the first appearance of symptoms after the age of 50-55). In other patients endoscopy is unlikely to contribute to medical management. In those a ''test and treat'' strategy implying non invasive testing for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and treatment of the infection if present seems to be the best approach under current conditions (H. pylori prevalence among dyspeptics 28-61% in recent studies). If the patient is H. pylori-negative and in case of persisting symptoms after successful H. pylori eradication, empirical treatment with an antisecretory drug is justified. Endoscopy is reserved for those patients in whom this approach fails. With a continuing decrease in H. pylori prevalence the accuracy of the used non-invasive H. pylori test needs to be high and urea breath tests are to be preferred, the faecal antigen test being a reasonable alternative. At a very low prevalence of H. pylori in the dyspeptic population (below 10%) non invasive testing for H. pylori loses its significance and empirical treatment with an antisecretory drug becomes a rational first step. The physician involved in the care for dyspeptic patients needs to be aware of the current H. pylori prevalence.\nDocument [5]: Title: Comparison of clinical symptoms after <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication in functional dyspepsia patients based on endoscopic view of antral gastropathy. Abstract: Functional dyspepsia is a common gastric disease that can be associated with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate antral endoscopy of individuals who presented with functional dyspepsia, <i>H.&#160;pylori</i> infection status and the effects of eradication therapy on the symptoms. Following the diagnosis of dyspepsia as per Rome III criteria, 260 individuals who were eligible for the study underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and were divided into four groups of 65 according to the endoscopic view, grades I, II, III and IV (negative). Stool antigen test was also performed for all patients to identify <i>H.&#160;pylori</i> infection. The early signs of dyspepsia were assessed by a standard questionnaire. In all groups, omeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole were used for eradication treatment, and 1 month after the treatment, a faecal antigen test was repeated to evaluate the eradication of <i>H.&#160;pylori</i>. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of clinical symptoms before treatment. The highest response to eradication treatment was seen in individuals with antral gastropathy grade III (66.2%) and the lowest response was in patients without antral gastropathy Grade IV (32.3%). This difference was statistically significant. There was no statistically significant relationship between the participants in terms of family history, age, gender and response to treatment. Eradicating <i>H.&#160;pylori</i> reduces the symptoms of dyspepsia. The response of eradication therapy was greatest among the patients with grade III antral gastropathy.\nDocument [6]: Title: Guidelines for the management of dyspepsia. Abstract: Dyspepsia is a chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen; patients with predominant or frequent (more than once a week) heartburn or acid regurgitation, should be considered to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) until proven otherwise. Dyspeptic patients over 55 yr of age, or those with alarm features should undergo prompt esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). In all other patients, there are two approximately equivalent options: (i) test and treat for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) using a validated noninvasive test and a trial of acid suppression if eradication is successful but symptoms do not resolve or (ii) an empiric trial of acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 4-8 wk. The test-and-treat option is preferable in populations with a moderate to high prevalence of H. pylori infection (> or =10%); empirical PPI is an initial option in low prevalence situations. If initial acid suppression fails after 2-4 wk, it is reasonable to consider changing drug class or dosing. If the patient fails to respond or relapses rapidly on stopping antisecretory therapy, then the test-and-treat strategy is best applied before consideration of referral for EGD. Prokinetics are not currently recommended as first-line therapy for uninvestigated dyspepsia. EGD is not mandatory in those who remain symptomatic as the yield is low; the decision to endoscope or not must be based on clinical judgement. In patients who do respond to initial therapy, stop treatment after 4-8 wk; if symptoms recur, another course of the same treatment is justified. The management of functional dyspepsia is challenging when initial antisecretory therapy and H. pylori eradication fails. There are very limited data to support the use of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or psychological treatments in functional dyspepsia.\nDocument [7]: Title: [A multicenter randomized controlled study of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy followed by Jing-Hua-Wei-Kang in the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection and dyspepsia]. Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) eradication rate and improvement of dyspepsia in patients who were newly diagnosed with <i>H. pylori</i> infection and dyspepsia and treated by bismuth-containing quadruple therapy followed by Jing-Hua-Wei-Kang(JHWK). <b>Methods:</b> Patients who were newly diagnosed with dyspepsia and <i>H. pylori</i> infection and treated in 16 medical centers in China between December 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019 were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (esomeprazole+amoxicillin+furazolidone+colloidal bismuth pectin capsule, 14 days), followed by JHWK (30 days), and the course of treatment was 44 days in total. In the control group, the administration regimen was bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (esomeprazole+amoxicillin+furazolidone+colloidal bismuth pectin capsule, 14 days). The main outcome measure was <i>H. pylori</i> eradication rate, while the secondary outcome measures were dyspepsia symptom changes and adverse events during the treatment and the 1st month after treatment. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1 054 patients were included in the study. There were 522 cases enrolled in the experimental group, including 224(42.91%) men and 298(57.09%) women, and the age was 53(26, 73) years old; 532 cases enrolled in the control group, including 221(41.54%) men and 311(58.46%) women, and the age was 46(22, 71) years old. Based on PP analysis, it was found that the <i>H. pylori</i> eradication rate in the experimental group was significantly higher than those in the control group (93.85% vs 87.88%, <i>P</i>=0.001). In the group of all enrolled patients, the symptom dyspepsia after <i>H. pylori</i> eradication was significantly improved compared with that before treatment [4(4, 7) vs 15(10, 22), <i>P</i>&lt;0.001], so was the superior and middle abdominal pain [1(1, 4) vs 4(1, 8), <i>P</i>&lt;0.001], the postprandial fullness [1(1, 4) vs 4(4, 9), <i>P</i>&lt;0.001], the early satiety [1(1, 1) vs 4(1, 4), <i>P</i>&lt;0.001], and the heartburn [1(1, 1) vs 1(1, 4), <i>P</i>&lt;0.001]. The symptom dyspepsia after treatment was significantly improved compared with that before treatment in the experimental, the control groups, the successful and the unsuccessful <i>H. pylori</i> eradication groups. The superior and middle abdominal pain after treatment was signifcantly improved than that before treatment [1(1, 2) vs 1(1, 4), <i>P</i>&lt;0.001], so were the postprandial fullness [1(1, 3) vs 1(1, 4), <i>P</i>=0.002] and the dyspepsia[4(4, 7) VS 7(4, 10), <i>P</i>&lt;0.001]. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the experimental group and the control group (1.34% vs 0.38%, <i>P</i>=0.09). <b>Conclusions:</b> Compared with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy followed by JHWK significantly improves the <i>H. pylori</i> eradication rate without increasing the incidence of adverse events. <i>H. pylori</i> eradication therapy can improve symptoms of patients with <i>H. pylori</i> infection and dyspepsia.\nDocument [8]: Title: [New Swedish guidelines for the management of dyspepsia, H pylori, and duodenal and gastric ulcers]. Abstract: New Swedish guidelines for the management of dyspepsia, H pylori, and duodenal and gastric ulcers The management of dyspepsia in Sweden differs between national county councils, and is often not in line with international recommendations. The Swedish Society of Gastroenterology has together with the Swedish College of General Practice (SFAM) developed new national guidelines for the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia, functional dyspepsia, Helicobacter pylori, and uncomplicated duodenal and gastric ulcers. The new Swedish guidelines emphasize that patients under 50 years of age with new onset of uninvestigated dyspepsia without any alarm symptoms or signs can be managed with the \u00bbTest and treat\u00ab strategy. Moreover, patients with a known H pylori infection and bothersome symptoms of functional dyspepsia shall be offered eradication therapy. The recommendations for triple therapy for H pylori eradication take into account the estimated average national antibiotic resistance patterns, environmental factors and potential effects on gut microbiota.\nDocument [9]: Title: Review article: uninvestigated dyspepsia and non-ulcer dyspepsia-the use of endoscopy and the roles of Helicobacter pylori eradication and antisecretory therapy. Abstract: Due to its prevalence, impact on quality-of-life and the associated significant health resource utilization, dyspepsia is a major healthcare concern. The available management strategies for uninvestigated dyspepsia include prompt endoscopy, the 'test-and-treat' strategy for Helicobacter pylori, and empiric antisecretory therapy. There is consensus that endoscopy should be reserved for patients with alarm features (e.g. symptom onset after 45 years of age, recurrent vomiting, weight loss, dysphagia, evidence of bleeding, anaemia), H. pylori-positive individuals who fail test-and-treat, and those with an inadequate response to empiric antisecretory therapy. Factors influencing the decision between test-and-treat and empiric antisecretory therapy in uninvestigated dyspepsia include the local prevalence of H. pylori and peptic ulcer disease and the proportion of ulcers attributable to H. pylori. For uninvestigated dyspepsia in patients without alarm features, test-and-treat is the preferred initial management method in Europe based on the relatively high prevalence of H. pylori/peptic ulcer disease whereas empiric antisecretory therapy is preferred in many parts of the United States, where the prevalence of H. pylori/peptic ulcer disease is relatively low. In patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia, H. pylori eradication and empiric antisecretory therapy result in comparable and small, but statistically significant, improvements in dyspepsia. Empiric antisecretory therapy is the preferred initial method of managing non-ulcer dyspepsia in Europe and the US. The test-and-treat approach would receive increased enthusiasm if H. pylori cure is shown to prevent development of gastric cancer in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients in a large Western trial.\nDocument [10]: Title: Role of Helicobacter pylori in functional dyspepsia. Abstract: The aetiology of dyspepsia is unknown in the majority of patients. Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is the cause in a subset of patients. A non invasive test to assess the presence of H pylori is recommended in the management of patients under the age of 50 presenting to a family practitioner with dyspepsia. A urea breath test or a stool antigen test are the most reliable non invasive tests. Eradication of H pylori will reduce the risk to the patient with dyspepsia of developing a peptic ulcer, reduce the complication rate if prescribed non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and later reduce the risk of gastric cancer. The recommended treatment for non ulcer dyspepsia associated with a H pylori infection should be a 10-d course of treatment with a PPI and two antibiotics. Treatment efficacy should be assessed four weeks after completing treatment with a urea breath test or a stool antigen test.\nDocument [11]: Title: Peptic Ulcer Disease and H. pylori Infection: Common Questions and Answers. Abstract: Peptic ulcer disease is common, affecting 1 out of 12 people in the United States. Approximately 1 in 5 peptic ulcers is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, with most of the rest due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. The combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use synergistically increases the risk of bleeding ulcers more than sixfold. The H. pylori test-and-treat strategy is the mainstay of outpatient management. Patients younger than 60 years who have dyspepsia without alarm symptoms should be tested and, if positive, treated to eradicate the infection. If negative, they should be treated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for patients 60 years and older with new symptoms and for anyone with alarm symptoms. Noninvasive testing for H. pylori using a urea breath test or stool antigen test is preferred. Bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy (nonbismuth quadruple therapy) is the preferred first-line treatment for eradication because of increasing clarithromycin resistance. To lower the risk of ulcers associated with long-term NSAID use, clinicians should consider coadministering a PPI or substituting an NSAID with less effect on gastric mucosa, such as celecoxib. Eradicating H. pylori in NSAID users reduces the likelihood of peptic ulcers by one-half. Potential risks of long-term PPI use include fractures, interaction with antiplatelet medications, chronic kidney disease, Clostridioides difficile infection, dementia, and magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12 micronutrient deficiencies.\nDocument [12]: Title: Which test for Helicobacter pylori in primary care? Abstract: Around 4% of primary care consultations are for dyspepsia, a term used for a specific group of upper gastrointestinal symptoms that includes abdominal discomfort, recurrent epigastric pain, bloating and heartburn. National guidelines recommend testing patients with uncomplicated dyspepsia for Helicobacter pylori infection, giving eradication therapy to those found to be infected and re-testing those who remain symptomatic after such treatment. Non-invasive tests for H. pylori avoid the need for endoscopy and biopsy to confirm infection, and several are now available for use in primary care. Here we review these tests and consider their role in the management of adults with dyspepsia.\nDocument [13]: Title: Dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori. Abstract: Dyspepsia is defined as a chronic or recurrent pain centered in the upper abdomen. Dyspeptic symptoms have a high prevalence in the population and represent a common reason for patients to see a primary care physician. Therefore, dyspepsia displays a major health care burden and produces high socioeconomic costs. The etiology of dyspeptic symptoms is various and complex and has opened a wide spectrum of putative mechanisms. In a subset of patients dyspeptic symptoms are likely to originate from Helicobacter pylori infection. Population-based studies have demonstrated that H. pylori is detected more frequently in dyspeptic patients compared to controls. H. pylori eradication therapy gives modest but significant benefit in non-ulcer dyspepsia and leads to long-term symptom improvement. It also reduces the risk of developing peptic ulcer disease and other H. pylori-related gastric pathologies (i.e. atrophic gastritis, gastric cancer). The main therapeutic strategy for managing dyspepsia in patients under the age of 45 years is 'test and treat'. H. pylori eradication is recommended in patients with dyspepsia and no other gastroduodenal abnormalities than H. pylori induced gastritis. In patients presenting with alarm features a prompt upper endoscopy should be performed to exclude peptic ulcer disease, esophageal and gastric malignancies or other more rare upper gastrointestinal diseases.\nDocument [14]: Title: Common Gastrointestinal Symptoms: dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori. Abstract: The most common diagnoses among patients with dyspepsia are functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer, and gastric or esophageal cancer. Helicobacter pylori infection is present in many patients with dyspepsia and is etiologic in some conditions. The evaluation of dyspepsia divides patients into 3 categories: 1) for patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), NSAIDs should be discontinued; if symptoms resolve after discontinuation, no further evaluation is needed; 2) for patients with reflux symptoms, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be prescribed without endoscopy unless alarm symptoms are present; and 3) for patients with no NSAID use or reflux symptoms, evaluation depends on risk. Patients older than 55 years or with alarm symptoms are at high risk and should undergo endoscopy. Those 55 years or younger with no alarm symptoms are at low risk. Those patients should be tested for H pylori and treated if results are positive. If symptoms persist after eradication treatment, PPIs should be prescribed for 4 to 6 weeks; if symptoms persist after treatment, endoscopy should be obtained. If H pylori test results are negative, PPIs should be prescribed for 4 to 6 weeks. Endoscopy should be obtained if symptoms persist. There are several regimens for eradication of H pylori. The most effective is sequential therapy with a PPI and amoxicillin for 5 days followed by a PPI, clarithromycin, and tinidazole for another 5 days.\nDocument [15]: Title: Update on Helicobacter pylori treatment. Abstract: One half of the world's population has Helicobacter pylori infection, with an estimated prevalence of 30 percent in North America. Although it is unclear whether eradication of H. pylori improves symptoms in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia, there is strong evidence that eradication of this bacteria improves healing and reduces the risk of recurrence or rebleeding in patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer. A \"test-and-treat\" strategy is recommended for most patients with undifferentiated dyspepsia. With this approach, patients undergo a noninvasive test for H. pylori infection and, if positive, are treated with eradication therapy. This strategy reduces the need for antisecretory medications as well as the number of endoscopies. The urea breath test or stool antigen test is recommended. Until recently, the recommended duration of therapy for H. pylori eradication was 10 to 14 days. Shorter courses of treatment (i.e., one to five days) have demonstrated eradication rates of 89 to 95 percent with the potential for greater patient compliance. A one-day treatment course consists of bismuth subsalicylate, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, all given four times with a one-time dose of lansoprazole. In children with documented H. pylori infection, however, all regimens should continue to be prescribed for seven to 14 days until short-course treatment is studied and its effectiveness has been established in this population.\nDocument [16]: Title: The health economics of Helicobacter pylori infection. Abstract: Economic considerations are becoming increasingly important as health care becomes more expensive. Evidence for effectiveness is usually gained from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) but often there is insufficient evidence of the costs of alternative strategies in trials. Often, therefore, economic models are needed to extrapolate data from a variety of sources to give an indication of which strategy is cost effective. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) testing and treating in a wide variety of upper gastrointestinal diseases is a good example of the application of economic analyses to health care interventions. H. pylori eradication in peptic ulcer disease is very effective with systematic reviews giving a number needed to treat of around two compared to no therapy. RCTs have also suggested that treating H. pylori is also more effective and less expensive than continuous H(2) receptor antagonist therapy and is therefore the dominant strategy in treating peptic ulcer disease. The impact of H. pylori eradication in infected patients with functional dyspepsia is less dramatic, with systematic reviews suggesting a number needed to treat of 14. Economic models suggest that in Europe H. pylori eradication is cost-effective compared to offering no treatment (e.g. in the UK we can be 95% certain this approach is cost effective if you are willing to pay $51/month free from dyspepsia). In the USA it is less certain that this is a cost-effective approach due to the higher cost of eradication therapy. H. pylori test and treat has been proposed as an alternative to early endoscopy in patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia. We have conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis of five RCTs that has addressed the cost effectiveness of this approach. Endoscopy was slightly more effective than H. pylori test and treat at relieving dyspepsia at one year but was not cost-effective as it cost $9000/dyspepsia cure at one year. Population H. pylori test and treat has been proposed as a strategy to prevent noncardia gastric cancer. RCTs have suggested this approach may be cost saving but more data are needed on whether H. pylori eradication will reduce gastric cancer mortality before this strategy can be recommended.\nDocument [17]: Title: Review article: should NSAID/low-dose aspirin takers be tested routinely for H. pylori infection and treated if positive? Implications for primary risk of ulcer and ulcer relapse after initial healing. Abstract: Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can each result in gastric or duodenal ulcer(s) and ulcer complications. Together, H. pylori infection and NSAIDs account for approximately 90% of peptic ulcer disease. In 2003, the results of studies suggest, and guidelines recommend, the careful selection of anti-inflammatory drugs - NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) based upon patients gastrointestinal history and use of aspirin therapy. Testing for, and cure of, H. pylori infection is recommended in patients prior to the initiation of NSAID therapy and in those who are currently receiving NSAIDs and have a history of dyspepsia, peptic ulcer or ulcer complications. For patients who present with peptic ulcer bleeding but require NSAIDs long-term, H. pylori eradication therapy should be considered, followed by continuous proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis to prevent re-bleeding, regardless of which kind of NSAID (nonselective NSAID /coxib) is being prescribed. Routine testing for, and eradication of, H. pylori infection has not been recommended for current takers of NSAIDs with no or low risk of complications. The management of patients taking low-dose aspirin is complex, but eradication of H. pylori infection alone in those with a past history of bleeding does not guarantee complete protection and therefore a proton pump inhibitor should also be given. The success of eradication therapy should always be confirmed, because of the risk of ulcer recurrence and bleeding in H. pylori-infected patients who require anti-inflammatory treatments.\nDocument [18]: Title: Drug treatment of functional dyspepsia. Abstract: Symptomatic improvement of patients with functional dyspepsia after drug therapy is often incomplete and obtained in not more than 60% of patients. This is likely because functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disease. Although great advance has been achieved with the consensus definitions of the Rome I and II criteria, there are still some aspects about the definition of functional dyspepsia that require clarification. The Rome criteria explicitly recognise that epigastric pain or discomfort must be the predominant complaint in patients labelled as suffering from functional dyspepsia. However, this strict definition can create problems in the daily primary care clinical practice, where the patient with functional dyspepsia presents with multiple symptoms. Before starting drug therapy it is recommended to provide the patient with an explanation of the disease process and reassurance. A thorough physical examination and judicious use of laboratory data and endoscopy are also indicated. In general, the approach to treat patients with functional dyspepsia based on their main symptom is practical and effective. Generally, patients should be treated with acid suppressive therapy using proton-pump inhibitors if the predominant symptoms are epigastric pain or gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Although the role of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) in functional dyspepsia continues to be a matter of debate, recent data indicate that there is modest but clear benefit of eradication of H pylori in patients with functional dyspepsia. In addition, H pylori is a gastric carcinogen and if found it should be eliminated. Although there are no specific diets for patients with FD, it may be helpful to guide the patients on healthy exercise and eating habits.\nDocument [19]: Title: ACG and CAG Clinical Guideline: Management of Dyspepsia. Abstract: We have updated both the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) guidelines on dyspepsia in a joint ACG/CAG dyspepsia guideline. We suggest that patients \u226560 years of age presenting with dyspepsia are investigated with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to exclude organic pathology. This is a conditional recommendation and patients at higher risk of malignancy (such as spending their childhood in a high risk gastric cancer country or having a positive family history) could be offered an endoscopy at a younger age. Alarm features should not automatically precipitate endoscopy in younger patients but this should be considered on a case-by-case basis. We recommend patients <60 years of age have a non-invasive test Helicobacter pylori and treatment if positive. Those that are negative or do not respond to this approach should be given a trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. If these are ineffective tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or prokinetic therapies can be tried. Patients that have an endoscopy where no pathology is found are defined as having functional dyspepsia (FD). H. pylori eradication should be offered in these patients if they are infected. We recommend PPI, TCA and prokinetic therapy (in that order) in those that fail therapy or are H. pylori negative. We do not recommend routine upper gastrointestinal (GI) motility testing but it may be useful in selected patients.\nDocument [20]: Title: [Helicobacter pylori-related diseases: dyspepsia, ulcer and gastric cancer]. Abstract: The main conclusions drawn from the presentations related to Helicobacter pylori at Digestive Diseases Week 2008 are summarized. Several strains of H. pylori frequently infect the same patient, and consequently samples for culture should be obtained from the gastric antrum and body. The test-and-treat strategy in dyspepsia is as effective as empirical antisecretory therapy and is probably cheaper. The benefit of eradication therapy in patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia, although small, seems to be lasting. Eradication in the general population seems to reduce the development of dyspeptic symptoms in the long term and consequently could be cost-effective. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in peptic ulcer is decreasing and the frequency of idiopathic ulcers is increasing. Patients with H. pylori-negative bleeding ulcers have a high probability of hemorrhagic recurrence and should therefore receive maintenance antisecretory therapy. H. pylori eradication reduces the incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma, which could warrant a screening and treatment strategy for this infection in the general population in high risk areas. H. pylori infection should be eradicated in patients undergoing endoscopic mucosal resection for early gastric cancer. To prevent the development of gastric cancer, eradication therapy should be administered early, before gastric atrophy develops. H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive gastric lymphomas have an equally favorable prognosis. New diagnostic techniques have been developed: the ultra-rapid urease test, a simpler 14C-urea breath test, and an ELISA method for rapid bacterial susceptibility determination. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, the 13C-urea breath test performed immediately after emergency gastroscopy allows early diagnosis of infection. Eradication regimens with double doses of proton pump inhibitors are more effective than those with standard doses. \"Sequential\" therapy is more effective and cheaper than classical triple-drug therapy, although the superiority of administering therapy sequentially rather than concomitantly has not been established. In penicillin-allergic patients, a combination with levofloxacin and clarithromycin is a promising alternative in rescue therapy. Second-line rescue therapy with levofloxacin is effective and is also simpler and better tolerated than quadruple-drug therapy. The rate of quinolone resistance is increasing as a result of the widespread use of these antibiotics. Third-line treatment with levofloxacin is also a promising alternative. Even after the failure of three previous treatments, a fourth empirical rescue therapy (with levofloxacin or rifabutin) can be effective in more than half of patients. The annual recurrence rate of H. pylori infection is approximately 3% in developed countries and is higher than 10% in developing countries.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: <b>Background:</b> The aim of this study is to estimate the budget impact of budesonide/formoterol fixed dose combination (FDC) vs salbutamol, both used as needed, in mild asthma patients, from the perspective of the Health Insurance Organization (HIO). <b>Methods:</b> A static budget impact model was developed to assess the impact of budesonide/formoterol FDC entry on HIO budget over a 3-year period in Egyptian settings. Direct medical costs, including the costs of asthma medications, exacerbations, and management of side-effects, were obtained from HIO cost data. Population data were obtained from the World Bank and supplemented with local studies, and the rates of exacerbations, adverse effects, and number of sick leave days were elicited from the SYGMA 1 trial. Scenario analyses from a societal perspective and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. <b>Results:</b> The total costs (drug and non-drug costs) for managing mild asthma patients from the HIO perspective were estimated to be EGP8.563 billion before budesonide/formoterol entry compared to EGP5.525 billion post-entry, leading to a total budget savings of EGP3.038 billion after 3&#8201;years. This total budget saving included an increase in drug costs (EGP104 million) and a decrease in non-drug costs (EGP3.143 billion). Drug costs were higher in the budesonide/formoterol group than in the salbutamol group, but this cost was offset by reductions in non-drug costs, resulting in a reduction in the total costs of healthcare resources. At the societal level, the total budget savings after including the indirect costs was expected to be EGP5.976 billion after 3&#8201;years of budesonide/formoterol entry. <b>Conclusion:</b> Budesonide/formoterol in mild asthma instead of salbutamol produces better patient outcomes and decreases total costs, with increases in drug cost offset by reductions in non-drug costs due to fewer exacerbations. Budesonide/formoterol is a budget saving option for guideline-directed treatment, from the economic perspective of the payer and the health perspective of the patient.\nDocument [2]: Title: Advances in the treatment of mild asthma: recent evidence. Abstract: Asthma affects about 300 million individuals worldwide. Although most patients have mild disease, the majority of them do not have good control and are at risk of exacerbations. Poor compliance with regular maintenance treatment is a considerable problem and is believed to be the main reason for poor control in asthma. In patients with moderate to severe asthma, maintenance and as-needed treatment with one inhaler containing an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and the long-acting inhaled \u03b22-agonist formoterol has been proved effective in reducing the risk of severe exacerbations. Recently, the results of 2 large double-blind randomized trials assessing the use of as-needed budesonide/formoterol in patients with mild asthma, who had indications for a regular controller treatment, were published. In comparison with as-needed terbutaline treatment, as-needed budesonide/formoterol treatment improved symptom control and reduced the risk of exacerbations. In comparison with regular ICS treatment, exacerbation rates were similar, but regular treatment schedule was associated with better asthma control (despite a higher cumulative ICS dose). The results of these trials have shown that as-needed budesonide/formoterol therapy has acceptable efficacy in mild asthma and may be viewed as a therapeutic option for these patients. As-needed treatment may be preferred by patients who fear the side effects of ICS treatment or by those who experience difficulty in following a fixed-dose regimen. Patients with mild asthma wishing to achieve optimal asthma control may prefer regular maintenance treatment with an ICS.\nDocument [3]: Title: The effect of formoterol over 24 h in patients with asthma: the role of enantiomers. Abstract: The single-dose effect of formoterol racemate and enantiomers on bronchodilatation up to 24 h was determined. Forty-six reversible asthmatic patients were randomised to this double blind, crossover study. Formoterol was inhaled by nebulizer (HaloLite); 4.5 and 36 microg of the racemate (rac-formoterol), 2.25 and 18 microg of (R;R)-formoterol, 18 mirog of (S;S)-formoterol, or placebo. Airway and systemic effects were assessed by serial measurements of forced expiratory volume during the first second, FEV1 (24 h), and heart rate (4 h). Rac- and (R;R)-formoterol significantly and dose-dependently increased FEV1 with similar mean maximal effect. (S;S)-formoterol was without significant effects on FEV1 and heart rate. (R;R)- and rac-formoterol were still effective 22-24 h after single high doses, but this was associated with some systemic side effect (increased heart rate) initially. Average 22-24 h FEV1 was 8% (rac-formoterol 36 microg) and 11% ((R;R)-formoterol 18 microg) over placebo, respectively. No significant differences in effects were observed between rac- and (R;R)-formoterol. Thus, the single dose bronchodilatating effect of formoterol resides in (R;R)-formoterol. This study does not indicate a clinically important advantage of (R;R)-formoterol as acute bronchodilator compared to the racemate.\nDocument [4]: Title: Modulite technology in the development of formoterol HFA pMDI: clinical evidence and future opportunities. Abstract: This article is based on published safety and efficacy data on formoterol pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) developed with the Modulite technology. This technology allows the development of ozone-friendly inhaled drugs that replace the same doses of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-formulated products and enables the attainment of new formulations with extra-fine particles and improved lung deposition. Clinical pharmacology, as well as clinical studies against comparators, have demonstrated that formoterol Modulite and the existing dry powder inhaler and CFC formoterol formulations have a similar pharmacokinetic profile, are clinically equivalent in bronchodilating effects and exhibit a similar potential for systemic side effects. Therefore, the Modulite formoterol hydrofluoroalkane-based formulation in extra-fine particles is a valuable therapeutic option for both patients and physicians in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nDocument [5]: Title: Exposure-Response and Clinical Outcome Modeling of Inhaled Budesonide/Formoterol Combination in Asthma Patients. Abstract: Exposure-response and clinical outcome (CO) model for inhaled budesonide/formoterol was developed to quantify the relationship among pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and CO of the drugs and evaluate the covariate effect on model parameters. Sputum eosinophils cationic proteins (ECP) and forced expiratory volume (FEV1) were selected as PD markers and asthma control score was used as a clinical outcome. One- and two-compartment models were used to describe the PK of budesonide and formoterol, respectively. The indirect response model (IDR) was used to describe the PD effect for ECP and FEV1. In addition, the symptomatic effect on the disease progression model for CO was connected with IDR on each PD response. The slope for the effect of ECP and FEV1 to disease progression were estimated as 0.00008 and 0.644, respectively. Total five covariates (ex. ADRB2 genotype etc.) were searched using a stepwise covariate modeling method, however, there was no significant covariate effect. The results from the simulation study were showed that a 1 puff b.i.d. had a comparable effect of asthma control with a 2 puff b.i.d. As a result, the 1 puff b.i.d. of combination drug could be suggested as a standardized dose to minimize the side effects and obtain desired control of disease compared to the 2 puff b.i.d.\nDocument [6]: Title: Pharmacological strategies for self-management of asthma exacerbations. Abstract: Written action plans are effective within asthma self-management, but there are few guidelines about the specific medication adjustments which can be recommended for self-treatment of exacerbations. This review examines pharmacological strategies for self-management of asthma exacerbations in adults, including those for inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2-agonist (ICS/LABA) users. Oral corticosteroids are well-established in clinical practice and clinical trials for the treatment of severe exacerbations, including during combination therapy. Evidence supports 7-10 days treatment, with no need to taper except to reduce side-effects. Doubling the dose of ICS is not effective. Several studies have shown benefit from high-dose ICS (2,400-4,000 microg beclomethasone equivalent) for 1-2 weeks. This may be achieved by adding a high-dose ICS inhaler to maintenance ICS or ICS/LABA therapy. There is inconclusive evidence about acutely increasing the dose of maintenance budesonide/formoterol for exacerbations, and no studies of this approach with fluticasone/salmeterol. For patients taking maintenance budesonide/formoterol, use of the same medication as-needed reduces exacerbations. Short-acting beta2-agonists are still effective in producing bronchodilation during combination therapy; however, a higher dose may be required. There is a need for further studies to clarify remaining issues about self-management of asthma exacerbations, particularly with regard to side-effects of treatment and patient acceptability.\nDocument [7]: Title: [Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy: an effective and easy approach to asthma management]. Abstract: Although much progress has been achieved in the treatment of asthma it continues to constitute an important public health problem. Asthma guidelines have been developed to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of asthma worldwide. Studies on asthma control have unfortunately shown that asthma treatment is far from reaching the guideline goals. Recently the Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART) approach has gained importance in the control of asthma which suggests the use of a maintenance dose of budesonide/formoterol as well as budesonide/formoterol for relief. Several clinical studies evaluating the new approach have been completed. Use of budesonide/formoterol maintenance + reliever therapy led to a greater reduction in risks of exacerbations than the conventional treatment regimens (higher ICS or similar or higher ICS/LABA) with short-acting Beta(2)-agonist and provided similar or better current asthma control compared to high dose ICS/long acting Beta(2)-agonist therapy in moderate-severe, uncontrolled, persistent asthma patients. SMART studies also demonstrated that this approach is advantageous in terms of patient compliance since it allows the use of a single inhalation device as both maintenance and rescue therapy; led to lower total healthcare costs and did not differ from the conventional treatment regimens in terms of frequency of side effects. In all the above mentioned studies, mean ICS doses were found to be lower in budesonide/ formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy groups than in the comparison groups. Most studies have revealed better asthma control, improved respiratory function tests and reduced oral steroid use at lower ICS doses. SMART approach seems to be promising as a treatment approach that treats both chronic and dynamic increases in inflammation with maintenance and reliever therapy in uncontrolled, moderate-severe persistent asthma patients.\nDocument [8]: Title: Suicidal ideation and thought disorder associated with the formoterol component of combined asthma medication. Abstract: Combination inhaled asthma medications containing corticosteroids and long-acting beta-adrenergic (LABA) agents are generally well tolerated, although a small minority of children receiving them may develop side-effects. Herein is reported a case of a 9-year-old boy who developed insomnia, pressured speech, agitation, and suicidal ideation within the 1st month after initiating formoterol + budesonide. He had not received oral glucocorticoids for >90 days. All symptoms resolved within 48 hr upon discontinuing formoterol while continuing budesonide. To our knowledge, this is the first report of childhood suicidal ideation strongly associated with use of a combination inhaled corticosteroid/LABA.\nDocument [9]: Title: Budesonide/formoterol: a review of its use in asthma. Abstract: Budesonide and formoterol have been combined in a single dry powder device, Symbicort Turbuhaler (budesonide/formoterol 160/9-640/18 microg/day), in an effort to simplify asthma management. The efficacy of budesonide/formoterol as maintenance therapy in patients with asthma has been examined in several randomised studies.Twice-daily budesonide/formoterol was significantly more effective than an equivalent or higher daily dose of budesonide alone or high-dose fluticasone propionate alone at improving peak expiratory flow (PEF) in adults with predominantly moderate persistent asthma. Symptom control and the risk of mild exacerbations were significantly improved versus budesonide alone. Moreover, budesonide/formoterol appeared to be as effective as concurrent therapy with equivalent dosages of budesonide and formoterol administered via separate inhalers in adults with moderate persistent asthma. Budesonide/formoterol administered once daily was as effective as twice-daily administration (equivalent daily doses) and more effective than once-daily budesonide in adults with moderate persistent asthma. Twice-daily budesonide/formoterol significantly improved PEF compared with budesonide in paediatric patients with asthma. Adjustable maintenance dosing with budesonide/formoterol was associated with significantly less study drug use than fixed dosing with budesonide/formoterol in adults with predominantly mild or moderate persistent asthma. In two of three studies (all longer than 4 months' duration), the risk of exacerbations was significantly lower with adjustable than with fixed dosing, but no difference was detected in four short-term studies. Symptom severity was maintained or improved in most patients receiving either treatment regimen. In adults with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, adjustable maintenance dosing with budesonide/formoterol reduced the rate of exacerbations and reliever medication use compared with fixed dosing with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. Budesonide/formoterol was well tolerated in both fixed and adjustable dosing regimens. In conclusion, in patients with persistent asthma symptoms despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, budesonide/formoterol administered via a single dry powder Turbuhaler device is an effective, well tolerated, convenient treatment option, which may have the potential for improved compliance. It appears to be as effective as treatment with budesonide and formoterol administered via separate inhalers and is more effective than budesonide monotherapy in improving PEF, controlling symptoms and preventing mild exacerbations. Adjustable maintenance dosing with budesonide/formoterol is associated with a lower overall dosage and appears to maintain control as effectively as fixed dosing.\nDocument [10]: Title: Efficacy and safety of budesonide/formeterol combination therapy in asthma patients. Abstract: Budesonide/formoterol as single inhaler was developed for treating asthma patients who are not adequately controlled on glucocorticoides alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy, safety and patient/physician satisfaction of budesonide/formoterol therapy.Total of 268 asthma patients (120 men, mean age 38.8 +/- 37.2 years, and 148 women, mean age 42.2 +/- 32 years) were included in the study. All patients received budesonide/formoterol bid (640 mcg of budesonide and 18 mcg of formoterol daily) during run-in period for three weeks. Patients were followed during 14 weeks at 5 visits. At each visit lung function (FEV1 and PEF) was measured,presence of side affects was recorded and questionnaire was given to patients and physicians to estimate the level of satisfaction with budesonide/formoterol therapy (1 very unsatisfied to 5 very satisfied). Significant improvement was noticed in FEV1, from 76.25% of predicted value to 86.94% (p < 0.01); and in PEF from 380.84 L/min to 442.29 L/min (p < 0.01) in all patients. At the end of the study patients' satisfaction with budesonide/formeterol therapy was significantly improved comparing with satisfaction with previously taken therapy, in average grade, from 2.94 to 4.56 (p < 0.01), and similar results were noticed with physicians' satisfaction, from 2.60 to 4.41 (p < 0.01). Budesonide/formoterol in single inhaler, significantly improved lung function in patients with asthma.\nDocument [11]: Title: Effectiveness and safety of adjustable maintenance dosing with budesonide/formoterol turbuhaler compared with traditional fixed doses in bronchial asthma: a multi-centre Nigerian study. Abstract: The modern treatment guideline of bronchial asthma recognize that combination of long acting beta2-agonists and inhaled glucocorticoids, enables better control of inflammation and symptoms of asthma than inhaled glucocorticoids only. These guidelines recommended that patients are educated to adjust their medication to their asthma severity using physician-guided self-management plans. However, many patients take a fixed dose of their controller medication and adjust their reliever medication to asthma symptoms Therefore, combination of formoterol and budesonide can be delivered at different dosing level without the need to change inhalers. This study examined whether asthma control improved if patients adjusted the maintenance doses(AMD) ofbudesonide/formoterol (Symbicort, 80/ 4.5 microg and 160/4.5 microg) according to asthma severity compared with traditional fixed dosing (FD) regimens. This was a prospective open randomized trial carried out in five teaching hospitals across Nigeria between 15th July 2002 and 15th July 2003. Patients with bronchial asthma who met the enrollment criteria were randomized to receive either adjustable dosing or fixed dosing for a period of twelve weeks. The results obtained at the start and the end of the study showed that budesonide/formoterol combination effectively achieved and maintained control of asthma. The adjustable dosing achieves more effective control compared to fixed dosing in terms of the number of patients that are redistributed to less severe forms of persistent asthma. The percentage of patients with intermittent asthma increased from 9.3% at randomization to 55.6% at the end of therapy with more patients at the AMD arm of treatment. Also for mild persistent asthma there was an increase from 20.4% to 24.1%. This showed that at the end of treatment, majority (79.7%) of the patients had intermittent and mild persistent asthma. The frequency of use of budesonide/formoterol in the two arms of treatment showed that patients in the adjustable groups used less number of inhalations of budesonide/formoterol for treatment on average of 2.5 inhalations per day compared to those on fixed dosing who used 4 inhalations per day (p = 0.0001). The number of times patients stayed awake because of asthma was noticed to be more reduced at the adjustable arm of treatment but this was of no statistical significance. It is therefore concluded, that budesonide/formoterol combination in a single inhaler is a simple, well tolerated, convenient treatment which provides effective control of bronchial asthma using a practical self-management plan consistent with current guidelines.\nDocument [12]: Title: A benefit-risk assessment of inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists in the management of obstructive pulmonary disease. Abstract: The two inhaled long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, salmeterol and formoterol, have been studied extensively since their introduction in the early 1990s. In this review we consider the evidence for their efficacy and safety in adults with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by reviewing long-term prospective studies in which these drugs have been compared with placebo or an alternative bronchodilator. We have also assessed safety, including data from postmarketing surveillance studies and case-control studies using large databases. In patients with asthma, salmeterol and formoterol increase lung function, reduce asthmatic symptoms and improve quality of life when compared with placebo. Both drugs protect against exercise-induced asthma, although some tolerance develops with regular use. Tolerance to the bronchodilator effects of formoterol has also been seen, although this is small and most of the beneficial effects are maintained long-term. Both drugs have been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations but only in studies in which most patients were taking an inhaled corticosteroid. Adding a long-acting beta2-agonist provided better control than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid in several studies. Long-acting beta2-agonists also provide better asthma control than use of regular short-acting beta2-agonists and theophylline. Their relative efficacy compared with leukotriene antagonists is uncertain as yet. Formoterol appears to be at least as safe and effective as a short-acting beta2-agonist when used on an 'as required' basis. In patients with COPD, both salmeterol and formoterol offer improved lung function and reduced COPD symptoms compared with placebo, and quality of life has been improved in some studies. Some tolerance to the bronchodilating effect of salmeterol was seen in one study. Most studies have not found a significant reduction in exacerbations in COPD. Both drugs have provided greater benefit than ipratropium bromide or theophylline; there are limited data on tiotropium bromide. The long-acting beta2-agonists cause predictable adverse effects including headache, tremor, palpitations, muscle cramps and a fall in serum potassium concentration. Salmeterol can also cause paradoxical bronchospasm. There is some evidence that serious adverse events including dysrhythmias and life-threatening asthma episodes can occur; however, the incidence of such events is very low but may be increased in patients not taking an inhaled corticosteroid. Salmeterol 50 microg twice daily and formoterol 12 microg twice daily are effective and safe in treating patients with asthma and COPD. Higher doses cause more adverse effects, although serious adverse events are rare.\nDocument [13]: Title: New pharmacologic perspectives in pneumology: beclomethasone-formoterol extrafine. Abstract: International asthma guidelines have recently focused on the concept of <<control>>, which is the main outcome to reach and maintain in the long term management. Asthma control is associated with several positive consequences, both in terms of quality of life and pathophysiological findings. Combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting-beta2-agonists (LABA) is recommended in a large part of asthmatic subjects (those who are not controlled with low-dose ICS alone).Recently, a new beclomethasone/formoterol combination in an extrafine HFA formulation has been developed. This new technology allows to obtain a very high fine particle fraction which reaches lower airways, while the dose which remain in the upper airways and possibly responsible for systemic side effects is very low. Therefore, this combination allows a different dose ratio between BDP and the other ICS (budesonide, fluticasone), in favour of a lower dose of BDP. Recent studies have demonstrated the equivalence of this new combination with the other ICS/LABA combination, as regards all asthma outcomes. Then, this new BDP/formoterol combination may increase the possibility to manage adequately patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.\nDocument [14]: Title: Budesonide and formoterol reduce early innate anti-viral immune responses in vitro. Abstract: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airways disease in which respiratory viral infections frequently trigger exacerbations. Current treatment of asthma with combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta2 agonists improves asthma control and reduces exacerbations but what impact this might have on innate anti-viral immunity is unclear. We investigated the in vitro effects of asthma drugs on innate anti-viral immunity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy and asthmatic donors were cultured for 24 hours with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist, imiquimod, or rhinovirus 16 (RV16) in the presence of budesonide and/or formoterol. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and expression of anti-viral intracellular signalling molecules were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR respectively. In PBMC from healthy donors, budesonide alone inhibited IP-10 and IL-6 production induced by imiquimod in a concentration-dependent manner and the degree of inhibition was amplified when budesonide and formoterol were used in combination. Formoterol alone had little effect on these parameters, except at high concentrations (10\u207b\u2076 M) when IL-6 production increased. In RV16 stimulated PBMC, the combination of budesonide and formoterol inhibited IFN\u03b1 and IP-10 production in asthmatic as well as healthy donors. Combination of budesonide and formoterol also inhibited RV16-stimulated expression of the type I IFN induced genes myxovirus protein A and 2', 5' oligoadenylate synthetise. Notably, RV16 stimulated lower levels of type Myxovirus A and oligoadenylate synthase in PBMC of asthmatics than control donors. These in vitro studies demonstrate that combinations of drugs commonly used in asthma therapy inhibit both early pro-inflammatory cytokines and key aspects of the type I IFN pathway. These findings suggest that budesonide and formoterol curtail excessive inflammation induced by rhinovirus infections in patients with asthma, but whether this inhibits viral clearance in vivo remains to be determined.\nDocument [15]: Title: Formoterol PLGA-PEG Nanoparticles Induce Mitochondrial Biogenesis in Renal Proximal Tubules. Abstract: Formoterol is a long-acting &#946;<sub>2</sub> agonist (LABA). Agonism of the &#946;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor by formoterol is known to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) in renal proximal tubules and recover kidney function. However, formoterol has a number of cardiovascular side effects that limits its usage. The goal of this study was to design and develop an intravenous biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle delivery system that targets formoterol to the kidney. Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles containing encapsulated formoterol were synthesized by a modified single-emulsion solvent evaporation technique resulting in nanoparticles with a median hydrodynamic diameter of 442 + 17 nm. Using primary cell cultures of rabbit renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs), free formoterol, encapsulated formoterol polymeric nanoparticles, and drug-free polymeric nanoparticles were biocompatible and not cytotoxic over a wide concentration range. In healthy male mice, polymeric nanoparticles were shown to localize in tubules of the renal cortex and improved the renal localization of encapsulated formoterol compared to the free formoterol. At a lower total formoterol dose, the nanoparticle localization resulted in increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#947; coactivator-1&#945; (PGC-1&#945;), the master regulator of MB, and increased electron transport chain proteins, markers of MB. This was confirmed by direct visual quantification of mitochondria and occurred with both free formoterol and the encapsulated formoterol polymeric nanoparticles. At the same time, localization of nanoparticles to the kidneys resulted in reduced induction of MB markers in the heart. These new nanoparticles effectively target formoterol to the kidney and successfully produce MB in the kidney.\nDocument [16]: Title: Pro-inflammatory action of formoterol in human bronchial epithelia. Abstract: Despite the wide usage of &#946;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists in asthma treatment, they do have side effects such as aggravating inflammation. We previously reported that isoprenaline induced Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion and IL-6 release via cAMP-dependent pathways in human bronchial epithelia, but the mechanisms underlying the inflammation-aggravation effects of &#946;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists remain pooly understood. In this study, we investigated formoterol, a more specific &#946;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist, -mediated signaling pathways involved in the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in 16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelia. The effects of formoterol were detected in the presence of PKA, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 and Src inhibitors. The involvement of &#946;-arrestin2 was determined using siRNA knockdown. Our results indicate that formoterol can induce IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in concentration-dependent manner. The PKA-specific inhibitor, H89, partially inhibited IL-6 release, but not IL-8. Another intracellular cAMP receptor, EPAC, was not involved in either IL-6 or IL-8 release. PD98059 and U0126, two ERK1/2 inhibitors, blocked IL-8 while attenuated IL-6 secretion induced by formoterol. Furthermore, formoterol-induced IL-6 and IL-8 release was attenuated by Src inhibitors, namely dasatinib and PP1, and CFTRinh172, a CFTR inhibitor. In addition, knockdown of &#946;-arrestin2 by siRNA only suppressed IL-8 release when a high concentration of formoterol (1&#160;&#956;M) was used. Taken together, our results suggest that formoterol stimulates IL-6 and IL-8 release which involves PKA/Src/ERK1/2 and/or &#946;-arrestin2 signaling pathways.\nDocument [17]: Title: \u03b22-adrenoreceptor agonist ameliorates mechanical allodynia in paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain via induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. Abstract: Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is a debilitating and common side effect of cancer treatment and so far no effective drug is available for treatment of the serious side effect. Previous studies have demonstrated \u03b22-adrenoreceptor (ADRB2) agonists can attenuate neuropathic pain. However, the role of ADRB2 in paclitaxel -induced neuropathic pain (PINP) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of formoterol, a long-acting ADRB2 agonist, and related mechanisms in PINP. A rat model of PINP was established by intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (2 mg/kg) every other day with a final cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg. Hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) in response to von Frey filament stimuli were used to evaluate mechanical allodynia. Western blot was used to examine the expression of ADRB2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), nuclear respiratory factors 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and the immunofluorescence was to detect the cellular localization of ADRB2 and PGC-1\u03b1 in the spinal cord. Moreover, we measured mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number by qPCR. In our study, formoterol attenuated established PINP and delayed the onset of PINP. Formoterol restored ADRB2 expression as well as mtDNA copy number and PGC-1\u03b1, NRF1, and TFAM protein expression, which are major genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, in the spinal cord of PINP rats. Moreover, we found the analgesic effect of formoterol against PINP was partially abolished by PGC-1\u03b1 inhibitor SR-18292. Collectively, these results demonstrated the activation of ADRB2 with formoterol ameliorates PINP at least partially through induction of mitochondrial biogenesis.\nDocument [18]: Title: Comparison of the bronchodilator and systemic effects of AZD3199, an inhaled ultra-long-acting \u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptor agonist, with formoterol in patients with asthma. Abstract: Pharmacologically mediated bronchodilation is important in the management of asthma, and is primarily achieved with \u03b2\u2082-agonists. Novel compounds should preferably have a longer duration of action and a better systemic side effect profile than established alternatives at comparable peak bronchodilation. This single-dose crossover study was conducted to investigate and compare with formoterol the bronchodilatory and systemic effects, tolerability and safety of AZD3199, a novel ultra-long-acting \u03b2\u2082-agonist (uLABA).\nDocument [19]: Title: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of beclomethasone/formoterol versus fluticasone propionate/salmeterol in patients with moderate to severe asthma. Abstract: Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by acute symptomatic episodes with variable severity and duration. Pharmacological asthma management aims to achieve and maintain control without side effects, thus improving quality of life and reducing the economic impact. Recently, a clinical trial showed the non-inferiority of beclomethasone/formoterol (BDP/F) versus fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S) in adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma. However, this study did not provide evidence on costs and did not quantify quality-of-life parameters.\nDocument [20]: Title: Routine Use of Budesonide/Formoterol Fixed Dose Combination in Elderly Asthmatic Patients: Practical Considerations. Abstract: Asthma has been demonstrated to be as common in the elderly as in younger age groups. Although no specific recommendations exist to manage the disease differently in older individuals, functional features and clinical presentations may be affected by age per se, and by age-related conditions, such as comorbidities and polypharmacy. In this review article, we aimed to explore the efficacy and safety in elderly asthmatic patients of one of the most currently used inhaled treatments for asthma, that is, the fixed-dose combination of budesonide/formoterol. We attempted to address some practical questions that are relevant to the daily practice of clinicians. We focused on the efficacy and real-world effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting \u03b2-adrenergic bronchodilators (ICS/LABA) as treatment in the elderly population, since data are extrapolated from younger populations. We investigated whether a maintenance and reliever therapy approach is more effective in the elderly as opposed to maintenance regimens, from both the general practitioner's and the pulmonologist's perspective. To address these questions, we scanned electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar) from the date of inception up to October 2016 with a cross-search using the following keywords: 'asthma', 'elderly', 'SMART therapy', 'MART therapy', 'Turbuhaler', and 'budesonide/formoterol'. The available literature on the topic confirms that when the age-associated changes are properly managed in clinical practice, asthma in older populations can be optimally controlled with inhaled treatment including ICS/LABA. This also applies for the budesonide/formoterol fixed combination, thus allowing for the maintenance and reliever therapy approach.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: 1. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of pseudoephedrine in coryza. 2. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, 48 adults with acute coryza received a single oral dose of 60 mg pseudoephedrine (Sudafed; Pfizer Consumer HealthCare Group, Caringbah, NSW, Australia) or matching placebo. Before and after dosing, nasal airway resistance (NAR), nasal volume, the minimum intranasal cross-sectional area (MCA) and the symptom of nasal congestion were measured. 3. Pseudoephedrine produced a significant decrease in NAR (P = 0.005; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.073, 0.383). Nasal volume increased, but this did not reach significance (P = 0.07; 95% CI -0.842, 0.034). There was no change in MCA and symptoms. 4. In conclusion, pseudoephedrine has a moderate effect in decreasing objective measures of nasal congestion in coryza.\nDocument [2]: Title: [Analysis of clinical effect of unilateral vidian neurectomy following endoscopic trans-sphenoethmoidal recess approach for allergic rhinitis treatment]. Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To explore the clinical efficacy of unilateral vidian neurectomy following endoscopic trans-sphenoethmoidal recess approach in treating allergic rhinitis.<b>Method:</b> The clinical data of 80 patients with moderate-severe allergic rhinitis who underwent unilateral vidian neurectomy following endoscopic trans-sphenoethmoidal recess approach were reviewed retrospectively. Visual analogue scale(VAS) was used to assess total symptom scores and nasal symptoms including nasal itching, nasal sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. The paired T test was used to compare the scores between surgical side and control side. Twenty-four patients with 3 years of follow-up were assessed by analysis of variance with comparison of means between multiple groups. Further comparison between any two means was performed by LSD-<i>t</i> test. <b>Result:</b> A total of 80 patients were followed up for one year, with 51 patients for two years and 24 patients for three years. Among 24 patients, total symptom scores and nasal symptoms (nasal itching, nasal sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal congestion) at pre-operation, 1 year,2 year and 3 year after operation were compared between surgical side and control side. There was no significant difference by the paired <i>T</i> test(<i>P</i>&gt;0.05),but there was statically significant by analysis of variance(<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) .The analysis of LSD-<i>t</i> test showed significant differences between pre-operative time point and each of the three time points after operation (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). <b>Conclusion</b>:The unilateral vidian neurectomy following endoscopic trans-sphenoethmoidal recess approach is an safe and effective technique in the management of moderate severe allergic rhinitis,and unilateral surgery could relieve bilateral nasal symptoms.\nDocument [3]: Title: Clinical, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the combination of acetylsalicylic acid and pseudoephedrine for the symptomatic treatment of nasal congestion associated with common cold. Abstract: It was the aim of this clinical study to demonstrate the efficacy of 1000 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, CAS 50-78-2) in combination with 60 mg pseudoephedrine (PSE, CAS 90-82-4), compared with placebo, in the symptomatic treatment of nasal congestion associated with the common cold. A further aim was to demonstrate the efficacy of 500 mg ASA + 30 mg PSE and of 1000 mg paracetamol (CAS 103-90-2) + 60 mg PSE (active control) in the symptomatic treatment of nasal congestion. The study was designed as a randomized, two-center, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-dose efficacy and safety trial over 6 h and was carried out in the USA. In total, at two centers, 643 patients who had a history and diagnosis of acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), were included; they showed symptoms such as nasal congestion, scratchy/sore throat, headache, generalized muscle ache, earache, runny nose, fever, sneezing etc. The investigational drugs ASA and PSE were both provided as granules in sachets and the granules were dissolved in water before administration; the combined preparation of paracetamol + PSE was administered as commercially available tablets encapsulated for blinding. For all preparations, matching placebos were provided. The primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve for differences from baseline on a nasal congestion scale in the first 2 h after treatment. To be eligible for the study, otherwise healthy volunteers were to present with nasal stuffiness of recent onset that reached a score of at least 6 on the 11-point scale for nasal congestion (0 = not stuffy, 10 = very stuffy). The primary analysis of the primary efficacy variable was calculated by analysis of variance including treatment group, severity (moderate/severe) and center as main strata. The analysis was performed using the intent-to-treat population. All active treatments proved to be statistically significantly superior to placebo with regard to the primary efficacy variable. Significant superiority of active treatment compared with placebo could also be demonstrated for an interval of up to 6 h after intake of the drug and for the relief of nasal congestion. The lower dose did not reveal significant different results compared with placebo for relief of nasal congestion in patients with a severe nasal congestion score at baseline. As well in patients with moderate nasal congestion score (NCS) at start of the study the difference from baseline in the NCS compared with placebo was not statistically significant. Thus a trend towards better efficacy in the higher dose could be assumed. No difference was found between 1000 mg ASA + 60 mg PSE and the active control. There were no differences between the two centers. The treatment proved to be safe and well tolerated, without relevant differences between the four treatment groups. Main adverse events were found to be related to the upper respiratory tract infection or were of gastrointestinal nature. In conclusion, the combination of ASA with PSE can be considered as an effective and safe\nDocument [4]: Title: Topical Nasal Decongestant Oxymetazoline: Safety Considerations for Perioperative Pediatric Use. Abstract: The over-the-counter nasal decongestant oxymetazoline (eg, Afrin) is used in the pediatric population for a variety of conditions in the operating room setting. Given its vasoconstrictive properties, it can have cardiovascular adverse effects when systemically absorbed. There have been several reports of cardiac and respiratory complications related to use of oxymetazoline in the pediatric population. Current US Food and Drug Administration approval for oxymetazoline is for patients \u22656 years of age, but medical professionals may elect to use it short-term and off label for younger children in particular clinical scenarios in which the potential benefit may outweigh risks (eg, active bleeding, acute respiratory distress from nasal obstruction, acute complicated sinusitis, improved surgical visualization, nasal decongestion for scope examination, other conditions, etc). To date, there have not been adequate pediatric pharmacokinetic studies of oxymetazoline, so caution should be exercised with both the quantity of dosing and the technique of administration. In the urgent care setting, emergency department, or inpatient setting, to avoid excessive administration of the medication, medical professionals should use the spray bottle in an upright position with the child upright. In addition, in the operating room setting, both monitoring the quantity used and effective communication between the surgeon and anesthesia team are important. Further studies are needed to understand the systemic absorption and effects in children in both nonsurgical and surgical nasal use of oxymetazoline.\nDocument [5]: Title: Herbs in dentistry. Abstract: Herbs have been used for centuries to prevent and control disease. Herbal extracts are effective because they interact with specific chemical receptors within the body and are in a pharmacodynamic sense, drugs themselves. By using herbal medicines, patients have averted the many side effects that generally come with traditional medicines, but this does not mean that side effects do not occur. Only knowledgeable practitioners can prescribe the right herb and its proper dosage. Herbal medicines had been considered in every culture, however, pharmaceutical companies overturned this type of thinking. Now, pharmaceuticals are called traditional and herbs are libeled as the 'alternative'. The biggest challenge and problem is lack of information about the effect of herbs in oral tissues, mechanism of effect, and side effects. Several popular conventional drugs on the market are derived from herbs. These include aspirin (from white willow bark), digitalis (from foxglove), and sudafed (modelled after a component in the plant ephedra). Herbal products can vary in their potency. Therefore, care must be taken in selecting herbs, even so, herbal medicines have dramatically fewer side effects and are safer to use than conventional medications. The herbs described in this article are Bloodroot, Caraway, Chamomile, Echinacea, Myrrh, Peppermint, Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, Aloe Vera, Propolis, and a summary of other herbs that are useful in dentistry. Herbs may be good alternatives to current treatments for oral health problems but it is clear that we need more research.\nDocument [6]: Title: Teratogen update: pseudoephedrine. Abstract: Pseudoephedrine is contained in decongestants such as the Sudafed line of products. It is an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, which causes blood vessel constriction, including the therapeutic effect of reducing airflow resistance in the nasal cavity. Pseudoephedrine is one of the most commonly used medications in pregnancy, with an estimated 25% of women exposed. It has been demonstrated that alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists slow uterine blood flow, but their effects have not been studied in relation to most reproductive outcomes in animals or humans. Two analyses of health maintenance organization pharmacy data identified 9 malformed infants among 902 first-trimester pseudoephedrine exposures, suggesting no association with birth defects overall; however, studies of such data sets often lack sufficient power to identify risks for specific birth defects. The related compounds, epinephrine, ephedrine, and phenylephrine, have been associated with hemorrhages and cardiovascular and limb malformations in animal models. Risk of ventricular septal defects was associated with decongestant use in pregnant women in 1 recent study. The vasoconstrictive effects of these drugs raise the hypothesis that their use in early pregnancy might increase the risk of vascular disruption defects. Case-control studies, which often do have power to identify risks related to specific birth defects, have explored this hypothesis. Decongestant use in the first trimester has been associated with small increases in risks of 3 defects thought to arise, at least in some instances, from vascular disruption-gastroschisis, small intestinal atresia, and hemifacial microsomia. These findings are somewhat consistent in terms of magnitude of effect and suggest that risks are even greater among women also exposed to the vasoconstrictive effects of cigarette smoking. There are, however, limitations to these studies, including the possibilities of inaccurate recall of exposures and confounding by indication. In addition, the majority of decongestant use is in oral form and the question of whether intranasal formulations carry risk has not been adequately addressed.\nDocument [7]: Title: Effect of mometasone furoate nasal spray on moderate-to-severe nasal congestion in seasonal allergic rhinitis: A responder analysis. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Nasal congestion is consistently identified as the most bothersome symptom of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), and, in guidelines, intranasal corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for nasal congestion. <b>Objective:</b> The aim of this post hoc cumulative responder analysis was to examine the nasal congestion response in detail by depicting the level of response obtained in two double-blind, placebo controlled studies of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) therapy for SAR, conducted from August to October 2008 at U.S. sites, in which nasal congestion was prespecified as the primary end point. <b>Methods:</b> Patients &#8805;12 years of age with a &#8805;2-year SAR history, positive skin test result, and moderate or severe nasal congestion were randomly assigned to once-daily treatment in the morning with MFNS or placebo for 15 days. The primary end point was the change from baseline in morning and evening reflective nasal congestion scores averaged over days 1-15. Treatment response, which ranged from &gt;0% to &gt;90% improvement, was evaluated at 10% intervals; &gt;30% and &gt;50% improvements were further evaluated by using the Mietinnen-Nurminen method weighted by study to test the differences of proportions. The Breslow-Day equal odds ratios test was used to justify pooling. <b>Results:</b> Of the 344 and 340 patients in the MFNS and placebo groups, respectively, the proportions of patients who experienced a &gt;30% response in nasal congestion, averaged over 15 days, were 37% versus 19% in the MFNS and placebo groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Those who experienced a &gt;50% response were 13% and 7%, respectively (p = 0.003). Among the patients treated with MFNS, the mean response was greater during the second versus the first week of treatment. There was no difference between responses in the morning versus evening or for patients with moderate versus severe nasal congestion at baseline. <b>Conclusion:</b> MFNS is effective in relieving moderate-to-severe nasal congestion in patients with SAR. The response to MFNS is maintained with once-daily administration and improves with continuous use over 2 weeks.\nDocument [8]: Title: Effectiveness of Over-The-Counter Intranasal Preparations: A Randomized Trial. Abstract: To compare the effectiveness of over-the-counter normal saline with nasal decongestant drops for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion, and to determine if nasal drops used alone are effective in the treatment of patients suffering from nasal congestion. Prospective, randomized double blinded study. Otorhinolaryngology Outpatient Department. Patients suffering from nasal congestion and similar symptoms such as nasal discharge, dryness, crusting, sneezing, itching and loss of smell. Resolution of symptoms based on visual analog scale and objective findings on anterior rhinoscopy. Chi-square test was done for comparison between the saline and decongestant groups. Subgroup analysis was done for patients on additional medication such as antibiotics. The <i>p</i> value is 0.701671 for the effectiveness of saline against that of decongestant, thus no significant difference exists between them for the relief of nasal congestion. The <i>p</i> value is 0.007497 for those on antibiotics and those that were treated only with nasal drops, thus showing a significant difference (level of significance being <i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). The effectiveness of both nasal saline and decongestant drops in bringing about relief of nasal congestion is similar, and both of them may also cause headache though the mechanism is not well understood from this study. Relief might be primarily obtained with the help of oral medication and not the use of nasal drops. <i>Level of evidence</i>: Single-center randomized trial, level II b.\nDocument [9]: Title: An evidence-based approach to managing the anticoagulated patient in the emergency department. Abstract: You start another busy shift with a double row of charts waiting to be seen. Your first patient is an elderly man who fell 1 hour prior to presentation. He did not lose consciousness, but he was dazed for a few minutes. He complains of a mild headache but denies any neck pain. He takes warfarin for valvular heart disease. He looks good and has no focal neurological complaints. His mental status is normal, he has a negative head CT scan, and his INR is 3.9. His family wants to take him home, which would help relieve some of the congestion in the ED, but you wonder what would be best. To observe and repeat imaging? Reverse his anticoagulation? Change his dosing regimen of warfarin? In the next room, you quickly evaluate a 51-year-old obese woman with nonspecific back and abdominal pain that started 24 hours before and has slowly progressed to become intolerable. She denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. She is on the last day of a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin for a UTI. She takes warfarin for a pulmonary embolus that occurred 2 months prior. Her hematocrit is mildly decreased, and her white blood count is normal; however, the INR is 6.8. You wonder if her abdominal pain is related to the UTI, or if it could be somehow related to the prolonged INR. In fact, you wonder why her INR is so prolonged...\nDocument [10]: Title: [Rhinitis medicamentosa]. Abstract: One type of non-allergic non-infectious rhinitis is represented by a heterogeneous group of rhinitis medicamentosa, which can be divided into several pathogenetic types. The most common rebound nasal congestion associated with the use of topical decongestants. Excessive use of intranasal decongestants leads to a decrease in the number of alpha-adrenoreceptors on the surface of cell membranes and uncoupling their connection with the G-protein and the development of tachyphylaxis. To prevent the development of rebound nasal congestion caused by topical decongestants, it is important to limit the frequency of their use. In most cases, the duration of the use of vasoconstrictor drugs should be limited to 5-7 days, according to Patient information leaflets for the drugs. However, in patients who have had a history of episodes of rebound nasal congestion, which develops including the previously indicated periods, the duration of decongestant therapy should be limited to 3 days. Rhinitis associated with local inflammation is caused by the intake of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Currently, the so-called \"aspirin triad\" is well known - a combination of bronchial asthma, rhinosinusitis (often polyposis) and intolerance to ASA. Neurogenic rhinitis develops due to the use of drugs that violate vascular tone, for example, antihypertensive drugs or type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Drug-induced rhinitis has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, secondary night apnea, insomnia as a result of nasal breathing disturbances, headaches, irritability, weakness after sleepless nights disturb patients to a large extent. Timely diagnosis and withdrawal of a provocative drug, the use of topical corticosteroids in case of severe rhinitis are the basis of the treatment of rhinitis medicamentosa. In severe cases, there is a need, including surgical treatment, such as, for example, submucosal laser destruction of the lower nasal concha.\nDocument [11]: Title: Selecting the optimal oral antihistamine for patients with allergic rhinitis. Abstract: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is now recognised as a global health problem that affects 10-30% of adults and up to 40% of children. Each year, millions of patients seek treatment from their healthcare provider. However, the prevalence of AR maybe significantly underestimated because of misdiagnosis, under diagnosis and failure of patients to seek medical attention. In addition to the classical symptoms such as sneezing, nasal pruritus, congestion and rhinorrhoea, it is now recognised that AR has a significant impact on quality of life (QOL). This condition can lead to sleep disturbance as a result of nasal congestion, which leads to significant impairment in daily activities such as work and school. Traditionally, AR has been subdivided into seasonal AR (SAR) or perennial AR (PAR). SAR symptoms usually appear during a specific season in which aeroallergens are present in the outdoor air such as tree and grass pollen in the spring and summer and weed pollens in the autumn (fall); and PAR symptoms are present year-round and are triggered by dust mite, animal dander, indoor molds and cockroaches. Oral histamine H(1)-receptor antagonists (H(1) antihistamines) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of AR. There are several oral H(1) antihistamines available and it is important to know the pharmacology, such as administration interval, onset of action, metabolism and conditions that require administration adjustments. When prescribing oral H(1) antihistamines, the healthcare provider must take into account the clinical efficacy and weigh this against the risk of adverse effects from the agent. In addition to the clinical efficacy, potential for improvement in QOL with a particular treatment should also be considered.\nDocument [12]: Title: [Drug-taking behavioral analysis in patients with allergic rhinitis]. Abstract: <b>Objective:</b>To analyze the drug-taking behavior of patients with allergic rhinitis, and the relationship with the severity of the symptoms.<b>Method:</b>A total of 1 621 sets of data in 66 patients with allergic rhinitis were enrolled in this study, who filled out the daily symptom score scale and daily medication score scale for 5 days or more. The symptoms include sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, nasal congestion, eye itching/foreign body sensation/red eyes and watery eyes were scored. The medications include antihistamines, nasal glucocorticoid, oral glucocorticoid, &#946;2 receptor agonists and inhaled glucocorticoid were scored.<b>Result:</b>In the 1 621 sets of data, the highest incidence of symptoms was sneezing, 50.77%, the highest incidence of moderate to severe symptoms was rhinorrhea, 10.06%. The drug-taking behavior was 827 times, and the drug&#57361;taking rate was 51.02%. Antihistamines had the highest use ratio, 73.64%, followed by nasal glucocorticoid, 49.33%. There was no direct relationship between the total symptom score and the drug-taking rate, nasal glucocorticoid use ratio. Compared with the group of continuous drug-taking less than 2 weeks, the total symptom score of the group of continuous drug-taking more than 2 weeks was significant low.<b>Conclusion:</b>The number and continuity of the drug&#57361;taking in patients with allergic rhinitis vary greatly. Patient education is needed.\nDocument [13]: Title: Targeting congestion in allergic rhinitis: the importance of intranasal corticosteroids. Abstract: The cardinal nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) are sustained by an underlying inflammatory process. Congestion is one of the most prominent and distressing symptoms for patients and is strongly associated with a broadly deteriorated quality of life and significant losses in productivity. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of intranasal corticosteroids (INSs) in down-regulating the inflammatory response to allergen and their clinical efficacy on AR symptoms, particularly congestion. AR is characterized by an influx of inflammatory cells and mediators into the nasal mucosa after antigen exposure. The response is biphasic, encompassing an early and a late phase. Antigen exposure has a priming effect, decreasing the threshold for subsequent allergic reaction on rechallenge and increasing the responsiveness of the nasal mucosa. INSs are a mainstay of therapy for AR and the most effective intervention for nasal congestion and other nasal symptoms, with established superiority to antihistamines, decongestants, and leukotriene antagonists. In addition to symptom relief, INSs suppress numerous stages of the inflammatory cascade, inhibiting the influx of inflammatory cells and mediators. Topical nasal corticosteroids have a low incidence of local adverse effects, negligible systemic absorption, and excellent safety. Congestion is one of the most bothersome symptoms of AR. INS therapy improves AR symptoms, with particular efficacy in relieving congestion, by attenuating nasal hyperresponsiveness. Pretreatment with INSs has been shown to relieve early and late-phase clinical symptoms of AR. Modification of the disease process results in significant relief of symptoms and leads to fewer disease exacerbations.\nDocument [14]: Title: Manganese-induced Parkinsonism among ephedrone users and drug policy in Poland. Abstract: A recent government's prohibition policy in Poland was partially successful with a reduction of the synthetic drugs market and a decrease in drug-related poisoning mortality rates. However, a new threatening trend is observed. There are a growing number of individuals in Poland and other European countries using legal pharmaceuticals containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to produce stimulants. This case report describes a history of a male patient with polysubstance dependence who administered self-designed ephedrone derived from Sudafed using potassium permanganate. He revealed significant clinical symptoms of manganese-induced parkinsonism. No effective treatment could be recommended. Awareness of this severe neurological and social consequences should lead to prevention efforts including educational programs and initiatives reducing availability of the legal medications containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. More research is needed to enhance our knowledge about manganism and potential treatment regimens.\nDocument [15]: Title: Mometasone furoate nasal spray: a systematic review. Abstract: The inflammatory diseases of the nose, rhino-pharynx and paranasal sinuses (allergic and non allergic rhinitis, NARES; rhinosinusitis with/without nasal polyposis, adenoidal hypertrophy with/without middle ear involvement) clinically manifest themselves with symptoms and complications severely affecting quality of life and health care expenditure. Intranasal administration of corticosteroids, being fast, simple, and not requiring cooperation, is the preferred way to treat the patients, to optimize their quality of life, at the same time minimizing the risk of exacerbations and complications. Among the different topical steroids available on the market, we performed a comparative analysis in terms of effectiveness and safety between mometasone furoate (MF) and its main competitors. Searching through Pub Med and Google Scholar and using as entries \"mometasone furoate\", \"rhinitis\", \"sinusitis\", \"asthma\", \"polyposis\", \"otitis media with effusion\", and \"adenoid hypertrophy\" we found 344 articles, 300 of which met the eligibility criteria. Taking into account relevance and date of publication, a sample of 40 articles was considered for the review. MF effectiveness for treatment and/or prophylaxis of nasal symptoms in seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis has been fully established with a level of evidence Ia. Even though it has not been assessed for MF in particular, topical steroids are the most appropriate treatment in mixed rhinitis and NARES. In acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) evidences support their use as mono-therapy or as adjuvant to antibiotics for reducing the recurrence rate, and decrease the usage of related prescriptions and medical consultations. In chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with Nasal polyposis, MF reduces polyps size, nasal congestion, improves quality of life and sense of smell and it is also effective in the treatment of daytime cough. The topical use of MF has great efficacy in the management of adenoidal hypertrophy and otitis media of atopic children. As regards the safety, MF has demonstrated an excellent safety profile: pregnant women can safely use it; no systemic effects on growth velocity and adrenal suppression have been shown; no changes in epithelial thickness or atrophy have been observed after long term administration of the drug.\nDocument [16]: Title: Treatment of the Common Cold. Abstract: Acute upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in adults and children, but only a few safe and effective treatments are available. Patients typically present with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, general malaise, and/or low-grade fever. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of the common cold can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that may not help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and ipratropium for cough. Lower-quality evidence suggests that Lactobacillus casei may be beneficial in older adults. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey (for children one year and older), nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. Over-the-counter cold medications should not be used in children younger than four years. Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses.\nDocument [17]: Title: Nasal congestion in infants and children: a literature review on efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological treatments. Abstract: The most common causes of nasal obstruction and runny nose in infants and children are infections, mainly of viral origin, or allergies. In neonates and infants viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) are frequently observed during episodes of nasal obstruction. Saline irrigation of the nose is believed to alleviate URTI symptoms by helping to eliminate excess mucus, to reduce congestion and by contributing to improve breathing. Objective of the study was to review the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological options for the treatment of nasal congestion and its sequelae, in infants and children, with a special focus on hypertonic and isotonic solutions and other medical devices, including nasal aspirators. Available data indicate that nasal symptoms in children with allergic rhinitis or acute sinusitis significantly improved following nasal saline irrigation. The use of medical devices is less documented. Nasal aspiration with a medical device, associated with an isotonic saline solution, during viral rhinitis, has been shown to lower the risk of developing acute otitis media and rhinosinusitis, in comparison with a group treated with physiological saline solution alone. Safety and tolerability have been evaluated and no serious adverse events have been reported. Literature data highlighted the good tolerability. The use of isotonic and hypertonic saline solutions to relief nasal congestion in infants and children is widespread; it is a safe and valuable therapeutic support, and can reduce the use of medications (antihistamines, decongestant, antibiotics, corticosteroids) during the treatment of URTIs.\nDocument [18]: Title: A stable fixed-dose combination tablet of pseudoephedrine and KOB extracts for the extended release. Abstract: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is characterized by inflammation of the nasal mucosa with hypersensitivity resulting from seasonal or perennial responses to specific environmental allergens and by symptoms like nasal rubbing, sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, nasal congestion and obstruction, and less frequently cough. KOB extracts, which is a polyherbal medicine consisting of 5 different herbs (Atractylodes macrocephala, Astragalus membranaceus, Saposhnikovia divaricata, Ostericum koreanum and Scutellaria baicalensis) had commonly been used for the treatment of various allergic diseases showed an anti-allergic effect by modulating mast cell-mediated allergic responses in allergic rhinitis, recently. On the other hand, pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine commonly used to relieve congestion in patients with allergic rhinitis and common colds. Considering the KOB's therapeutic mechanism, the combination with pseudoephedrine would be suitable for allergic rhinitis. This study is to obtain an effective extended release formulation using pseudoephedrine and KOB extracts to reduce side effects of drug due to repeated dosing and improve the compliance of patients for treatment of rhinitis and nasal decongestion. So, the fixed-dose combination tablet of pseudoephedrine and KOB extracts was prepared by direct compression and characterized by drug content, flowing characteristics and dissolution test. The drug content of baicalin of KOB extracts was within the range of 95-105% except for T1 formulation. The hardness and friability values of all formulations ranged from 9 to 13 kp and less than 1%, respectively. Taken together, T4 or T8 could be a stable fixed-dose combination tablet for extended release of pseudoephedrine and KOB extracts for nasal rhinitis.\nDocument [19]: Title: Effect of conventional and experimental gingival retraction solutions on the tensile strength and inhibition of polymerization of four types of impression materials. Abstract: In the present study, two types of tests (tensile strength test and polymerization inhibition test) were performed to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of four impression materials [a polysulfide (Permlastic), a polyether (Impregum), a condensation silicone (Xantopren) and a polyvinylsiloxane (Aquasil)] when polymerized in contact with of one conventional (Hemostop) and two experimental (Vislin and Afrin) gingival retraction solutions. For the tensile strength test, the impression materials were mixed and packed into a steel plate with perforations that had residues of the gingival retraction solutions. After polymerization, the specimens were tested in tensile strength in a universal testing machine. For the polymerization inhibition test, specimens were obtained after taking impressions from a matrix with perforations that contained 1 drop of the gingival retraction solutions. Two independent examiners decided on whether or not impression material remnants remained unpolymerized, indicating interference of the chemical solutions. Based on the analysis of the results of both tests, the following conclusions were reached: 1. The tensile strength of the polysulfide decreased after contact with Hemostop and Afrin. 2. None of the chemical solutions inhibited the polymerization of the polysulfide; 3. The polyether presented lower tensile strength after polymerization in contact with the three gingival retraction agents; 4. The polyether had its polymerization inhibited only by Hemostop; 5. None of the chemical solutions affected the tensile strength of the condensation silicone; 6. Only Hemostop inhibited the polymerization of the condensation silicone; 7. The polyvinylsiloxane specimens polymerized in contact with Hemostop had significantly lower tensile strength; 8. Neither of the chemical solutions (Afrin and Vislin) affected the tensile strength of the polyvinylsiloxane and the condensation silicone; 9. Results of the tensile strength and polymerization inhibition tests suggest that Vislin can be used as substance of gingival retraction without affecting the tested properties of four impression materials.\nDocument [20]: Title: Does nasal congestion have a role in decreased resistance to regular CPAP usage? Abstract: Nasal obstruction is known to cause resistance to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). In this paper, short- and long-term nasal congestion in OSAS patients receiving CPAP treatment were evaluated with acoustic rhinometry (AR). A total of 36 patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS, diagnosed with polysomnography were included in the study. Ten healthy subjects without OSAS constituted the control group. Pre-treatment nasal patency were measured with AR in all participants. 26 patients used the recommended CPAP treatment. Ten patients did not accept CPAP treatment. The AR test was repeated for all the subjects after 1 and 3 months except the 3rd month's measurements of the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the initial minimum cross-sectional area (MCA) measurements of OSAS patients, using or not using CPAP, and the control group (P > 0.05). However, the first month MCA measurements of patients receiving CPAP were found to be significantly decreased compared with the initial values (P < 0.001). There was no significant change in the first and third months MCA values in the control group and patients who did not use CPAP (P > 0.05). No significant difference revealed in the 3rd month MCA measurements of the patients using CPAP compared with the initial values (P > 0.05). In this study, the increased nasal congestion, which is thought to be the cause of CPAP resistance, was objectively demonstrated in OSAS patients using CPAP. In addition, the nasal congestion developing at the first month was shown to disappear over time, supporting the opinion that patient compliance in CPAP treatment is expected to increase after regular device usage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: The right to make an informed choice about contraception should be afforded to every individual serving within the United Kingdom (UK) Armed Forces. This article looks at the responsibilities and approach that healthcare professionals should take within a Primary Care setting, summarises the common contraceptive options available, discusses the associated advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and considers operational factors in a military environment that combine to influence the final contraceptive choice an individual makes. Case Study. A 19-year old Able Rate joined the Royal Navy (RN) and at her joining medical it was noted that she had been on Microgynon\u2122 combined oral contraceptive pill for approximately three years. During this time, her menstrual periods remained light; she never experienced adverse effects, demonstrated good compliance, and was happy to remain on this contraceptive regimen. Over the course of the next eighteen months, she was reviewed by a number of Medical Officers and Civilian Medical Practitioners on a quarterly basis, with Microgynon\u2122 re-prescribed on each occasion. The appropriate Defence Medical Information Capability Programme (DMICP) template was used, with weight, smoking status, compliance and any issues or comments documented accordingly. In December 2010, a discussion regarding long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) was documented for the first time. The patient agreed to give LARC some thought and a review appointment was made for one month. She was subsequently started on the progestogen-only pill Cerazette\u2122. It was noted by the consulting doctor that both the patient's mother and grandmother had a positive history of cerebrovascular events and the combined oral contraceptive pill was discontinued. Upon review at two months, the patient reported that she was content on Cerazette\u2122 and wished to continue with this medication. She was amenorrhoeic, highly compliant, had given up smoking and her weight and blood pressure were stable. However, due to supply issues, it was explained that Cerazette\u2122 was no longer a viable option for her. She had no plans to start a family, and was keen to investigate other contraceptive options. Furthermore, she expressed a particular desire to remain amenorrhoeic, as she was due to deploy overseas in the coming months, and not only wanted to avoid the inconvenience of having her period, but also felt it preferable not to have to take a daily pill when considering the constantly changing time zones. She subsequently had the etonogestrel-releasing subdermal implant Nexplanon\u2122 fitted without complication. She has remained amenorrhoeic throughout and this form of long-acting reversible contraception has particularly suited her busy working role and active lifestyle.\nDocument [2]: Title: ESH-ESC guidelines for the management of hypertension. Abstract: The following is a brief statement of the 2003 European Society of Hypertension (ESH)-European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension. The continuous relationship between the level of blood pressure and cardiovascular risk makes the definition of hypertension arbitrary. Since risk factors cluster in hypertensive individuals, risk stratification should be made and decision about the management should not be based on blood pressure alone, but also according to the presence or absence of other risk factors, target organ damage, diabetes, and cardiovascular or renal damage, as well as on other aspects of the patient's personal, medical and social situation. Blood pressure values measured in the doctor's office or the clinic should commonly be used as reference. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may have clinical value, when considerable variability of office blood pressure is found over the same or different visits, high office blood pressure is measured in subjects otherwise at low global cardiovascular risk, there is marked discrepancy between blood pressure values measured in the office and at home, resistance to drug treatment is suspected, or research is involved. Secondary hypertension should always be investigated. The primary goal of treatment of patient with high blood pressure is to achieve the maximum reduction in long-term total risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This requires treatment of all the reversible factors identified, including smoking, dislipidemia, or diabetes, and the appropriate management of associated clinical conditions, as well as treatment of the raised blood pressure per se. On the basis of current evidence from trials, it can be recommended that blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, be intensively lowered at least below 140/90 mmHg and to definitely lower values, if tolerated, in all hypertensive patients, and below 130/80 mmHg in diabetics. Lifestyle measures should be instituted whenever appropriate in all patients, including subjects with high normal blood pressure and patients who require drug treatment. The purpose is to lower blood pressure and to control other risk factors and clinical conditions present. In most, if not all, hypertensive patients, therapy should be started gradually, and target blood pressure achieved progressively through several weeks. To reach target blood pressure, it is likely that a large proportion of patients will require combination therapy with more than one agent. The main benefits of antihypertensive therapy are due to lowering of blood pressure per se. There is also evidence that specific drug classes may differ in some effect or in special groups of patients. The choice of drugs will be influenced by many factors, including previous experience of the patient with antihypertensive agents, cost of drugs, risk profile, presence or absence of target organ damage, clinical cardiovascular or renal disease or diabetes, patient's preference.\nDocument [3]: Title: Diagnosis and management of carbon monoxide poisoning in the emergency department. Abstract: An 89-year-old female is found by her family, lying unconscious on her kitchen floor after they had been unable to reach her by phone for several hours. EMS is activated and when the paramedics arrive, they note that the gas oven is on, and there is thin, gray smoke coming from around the door. The house gas supply is turned off, windows are opened, and the family and the patient are immediately evacuated from the home. En route to the hospital, the patient is placed on high-flow oxygen at 15 liters per minute by non-rebreather mask. Her bedside glucose determination is 229 mg/dL. Vital signs are within normal limits during transport. She opens her eyes to sternal rub, and makes spontaneous movements of all extremities. Upon arrival to the ED, the patient becomes more alert and is able to respond to your questions. She tells you that she remembers putting a tray of calzones into the oven, after which she has no recall of the day's events. She has a past medical history of \"well-controlled\" hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, simvastatin 20 mg daily, and metformin 1000 mg twice daily. On physical examination, weight is 65 kg, blood pressure is 97/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 113 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, temperature is 37.1 degrees C (98.8 degrees F), and oxygen saturation is 99% on 15 liters per minute via non-rebreather mask. She appears her stated age. Cardiopulmonary examination is remarkable only for tachycardia. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds. Her skin is warm and dry, and there is no peripheral edema. Her cranial nerves are intact, with briskly reactive, symmetric pupils. Motor and sensory examination is non-focal, and cerebellar testing is notable only for an intention tremor on finger-nose-finger test. Gait is normal and speech is fluent and without errors. Laboratory testing shows a hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 11.7 x 10(9)/L. Electrolyte results fall within the normal range, and her serum creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL. Qualitative CK-MB and troponin I tests are positive, and the sample has been sent to the STAT lab for quantitative testing. Serum carboxyhemoglobin level is 15% with normal serum pH on an arterial blood gas. An ECG reveals deep, down-sloping inferior and lateral ST-segment depressions which were not present on a routine cardiogram 1 month prior. You have many questions about this patient's care. What symptoms and physical signs need to be addressed and treated? What additional diagnostic testing should be performed? What treatment regimen is appropriate and what should be avoided? What are the risks or delayed complications from her illness? Are there special considerations for this or other patient populations?\nDocument [4]: Title: [Expert consensus statement on blood pressure measurement from the French Society of Hypertension, an affiliate of the French Society of Cardiology]. Abstract: Since 2016, the French Society of Hypertension has warned about the decline in the management of high blood pressure in France: stagnation, or even decreased number of people who know their blood pressure level, take a treatment and are controlled. These results are lower than those observed in many other countries. Blood pressure is measured with an old method in the doctor's office. Accepted, simple and cost-effective, this method is currently unavoidable for reasons of feasibility and social habit. It has been used in observational and intervention studies that are the basis of the medical reasoning for screening, treatment and drug control of hypertension. In practice, it is too often poorly applied and unpredictable. It is now necessary to measure blood pressure in mmHg using a validated oscillometric automatic device coupled to a specific upper arm cuff adapted to the arm circumferences for the diagnosis and monitoring of high blood pressure in the doctor's office and at home. The auscultatoric measurement is only recommended if any doubt about the reliability of the electronic measurement. Blood pressure measurement is basically performed on both arms to detect asymmetry and then on the arm with the highest blood pressure. It is performed in sitting or lying position after a few minutes of rest without speaking and without having smoked and then in standing position to diagnose orthostatic hypotension, especially in elderly, diabetic and multi-medicated subjects. The blood pressure measurement during the consultation must be repeated and include at least 3 consecutive measurements at one minute intervals. The average of the last 2 measurements determines the blood pressure level. It is recommended to perform BP measurements outside the medical environment for the diagnosis and monitoring of hypertension; Home BP measurement is preferred to ambulatory blood pressure measurement for practical reasons unless otherwise specified. The home blood pressure measurement should include three measurements in the morning at breakfast and three measurements in the evening before bedtime at one minute intervals for at least three days. Prior training must be provided. In treated hypertensive patients, a masked hypertension should be considered as an uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive therapy adapted accordingly. The measurement of central BP pressure (aorta) should be limited to clinical research.\nDocument [5]: Title: Naltrexone-Associated Non-ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction. Abstract: Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and opioid agonist therapy (OAT) are the mainstays of treatment in opioid use disorder. Significant caution is encouraged upon initiation to reduce the precipitation of opioid withdrawal. Cardiac events in the setting of opioid withdrawal are rare and incompletely understood. A 46-year-old woman with a history of opioid-use disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, tobacco-use disorder, and rheumatoid arthritis presented with nausea, vomiting, and lightheadedness after taking naltrexone following buprenorphine. She was found to be hypertensive and tachycardic in the emergency department, with a troponin of 0.38 ng/mL (reference: 0.00-0.30 ng/mL) and an electrocardiogram (ECG) without ST or T-wave changes. She was admitted for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypertensive emergency in the setting of opioid withdrawal. Her blood pressure was controlled, and she received full-dose aspirin and high intensity atorvastatin. Afterwards she was started on a modified OAT regimen of buprenorphine 8 mg daily. Her cardiac enzymes down-trended and her condition became stable after which she was discharged home. Cardiac events are an uncommon yet lethal occurrence in opioid withdrawal. The likely etiology of NSTEMI in our patient was demand ischemia induced by opioid withdrawal, augmented by her various other cardiac risk factors. Practitioners should be aware of these possible adverse events, especially in those with preexisting cardiac disease. Meticulous efforts should be made to instruct patients as to the proper dosing schedule when initiating opioid therapy, and when initiating MOUD/OAT in order to prevent poor outcomes.\nDocument [6]: Title: Using telemedicine to manage a patient with a hypertensive emergency due to pheochromocytoma. Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of telemedicine on a global scale. In endocrinology, telemedicine has mainly been used in relation to chronic diseases, including diabetes. Herein, we report the case of an 18-year-old woman with a hypertensive emergency due to a pheochromocytoma who was quickly diagnosed and treated using telemedicine. The patient was referred to a cardiovascular hospital because of fatigue and sweating that did not improve with carvedilol. She had fluctuating blood pressure and tachycardia. Subsequently, since her thyroid function was normal, endocrine hypertension not due to thyroid dysfunction was suspected; a case consultation was made by phone to our clinic. Plain computed tomography (CT) was recommended owing to the high possibility of a pheochromocytoma; the CT scan showed an adrenal tumor with a 30 mm diameter. To assess her condition, endocrinologists, together with the attending doctor, interviewed her and her family directly using an online tool to obtain detailed information. We thus determined that she was at risk of a pheochromocytoma crisis. She was transferred to our hospital immediately for treatment, was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma, and underwent surgery. Telemedicine, especially involving doctor-to-patient with doctor consultations, can be effective in treating rare and emergent medical conditions such as pheochromocytoma crisis.\nDocument [7]: Title: PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA DURING PREGNANCY-2 CASE REPORTS. Abstract: (Introduction) A pheochromocytoma diagnosed during pregnancy is rare, and also its fetal and maternal mortality is high if undiagnosed. We report two cases with successful pregnancy outcome with pheochromocytoma. (Case 1) A 31-years-old previously healthy woman presented at 19 week period of gestation with high blood pressure. High urine catecholamine level and a left adrenal mass recognized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed adrenal pheochromocytoma. The patient had good blood pressure control after we started doxazosin 4 mg daily, and Caesarean section was performed at 35 week period of gestation. Two months after delivery, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed and she was discharged in the absence of hypertension. (Case 2) A 31-years-old previously healthy woman presented at 29 week period of gestation with exacerbation of headache and palpitation. High urine catecholamine level and a mass recognized close to the inferior vena cava by MRI confirmed extraadrenal pheochromocytoma. The patient had good blood pressure after we started doxazosin 4 mg daily and labetalol hydrochloride 200 mg daily. Caesarean section was performed at 35 week period of gestation. One month after delivery, laparotomic resection of the tumor was performed. Seven years later, hypertension reoccurred and there was an extraadrenal pheochromocytoma recurrence. We had a laparotomic resection for the recurrent tumor, and now she is in the absence of hypertension. (Conclusion) Pheochromocytoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis in a case of high blood pressure occurred during pregnancy. Early detection and appropriate treatment is crucial to reduce fetal and maternal mortality.\nDocument [8]: Title: Use of atypical antipsychotics and risk of hypertension: A case report and review literature. Abstract: Atypical antipsychotics is being considered in the treatment of \"negative\" symptoms of psychoses, such as schizophrenia. In this case report, we presented a case of a patient with psychiatric disorder who developed hypertension soon after starting using atypical antipsychotic. A 53-year-old woman had reported having episodes of tachycardia, nausea, headache and high blood pressure. At the time of the doctor's appointment, the blood pressure was 210/110 mmHg. According to the patient, she made use of simvastatin for dyslipidemia and started taking aripiprazole, an antipsychotic for approximately 40 days before the symptoms. The initial treatment was 20 mg of olmesartan, and examinations were requested. After 2 months, the patient returned with the examinations: altered serum lipids and the other results were normal. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed an average of 24 h of 150/100 mmHg. Blood pressure was measured at the doctor's office; in regular use of 20 mg of olmesartan, it was 156/92 mmHg. The dosage of olmesartan was increased to 40 mg and 1.5 mg of indapamide was initiated. The patient returned after 20 days with a blood pressure of 146/90 mmHg. After approval from the psychiatrist, the Aripiprazole was stopped, and the patient returned 15 days later with blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. The ambulatory blood pressure monitoring control showed an average of 24 h of 130/78 mmHg. The Dopamine receptors play a role in the regulation of the blood pressure and the alterations in this system can lead to hypertension. D1, D3 and D4 receptors interact with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, while D2 and D5 interact with the sympathetic nervous system in the regulation of PA. The case reported and the literature review bring to light the discussion of the use of atypical antipsychotics and its adverse events. If necessary, the use of these drugs should be followed by careful monitoring of blood pressure.\nDocument [9]: Title: Hypertensive emergency preceding the progression of periaortitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis: case report and review of the literature. Abstract: Hypertensive emergency is an important entity which should be managed adequately. A 65-year-old woman presented with blindness and elevated blood pressure of 254/131 mmHg. She was diagnosed with hypertensive emergency on physical examination, and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) with bilateral thalamic haemorrhage. After controlling her blood pressure with intravenous antihypertensive agents, periaortitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) were manifested by left hydronephrosis and creatinine elevation. She was diagnosed with periaortitis/RPF. Her blood pressure was well controllable, and PRES improved after treatment with prednisolone. Periaortitis/RPF should not be overlooked when hypertensive emergency suddenly occurs in patients with no history of hypertension.\nDocument [10]: Title: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome due to High Dose Corticosteroids for an MS Relapse. Abstract: Increased blood pressure is a known adverse effect associated with corticosteroids but little is published regarding the risk with the high doses used in multiple sclerosis (MS). A 53-year-old female with known relapsing remitting MS presented with a new brainstem relapse. Standard of care treatment for an acute MS relapse, 1250 mg of oral prednisone for 5 days, was initiated. She developed an occipital headache and dizziness and felt generally unwell. These symptoms persisted after treatment was complete. On presentation to medical attention, her blood pressure was 199/110 mmHg, although she had no history of hypertension. MRI changes were consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), demonstrating abnormal T2 signal in both thalami, the posterior occipital and posterior parietal white matter with mild sulcal effacement. As her pressure normalized with medication, her symptoms resolved and the MRI changes improved. No secondary cause of hypertension was found. This is the first reported case of PRES secondary to high dose corticosteroid use for an MS relapse without a history of hypertension and with no other secondary cause of hypertension identified. This rare complication should be considered in MS patients presenting with a headache or other neurological symptoms during treatment for a relapse.\nDocument [11]: Title: Traumatic hand injuries: the emergency clinician's evidence-based approach. Abstract: At the start of your Saturday afternoon shift, you are not surprised to see that several patients are waiting to be seen for physical injuries. The first patient is a 34-year-old woman who sustained injury to her hand while skiing, 2 hours prior to her arrival. She reports falling with her hand still tethered to the pole's grip, landing on her outstretched right hand. She felt a painful snap in her right thumb, which still hurts, but otherwise she did not sustain any other trauma. Her only complaint currently is pain at the base of the right thumb. The patient is otherwise completely healthy, has no past medical or surgical history, and takes no medications. Upon examination, the affected hand appears to be surprisingly normal except for mild tenderness and swelling over the ulnar aspect of her first metacarpophalangeal joint and mildly decreased strength in her pincher grasp. X-ray reveals no fracture. You wonder if there is additional testing that should be done to evaluate this injury. You move on to a second patient, a 24-year-old man who cut his ring finger knuckle when he punched a wall 2 days ago. Physical examination reveals a small puncture wound over the IV metacarpophalangeal joint with mild swelling, erythema, warmth, and decreased range of motion secondary to pain. X-ray reveals no fracture, but there's something suspicious about this case. A third patient is a 37-year-old industrial worker whose finger contacted the stream of a high-powered grease injector. Physical examination reveals a small puncture wound over the volar proximal interphalangeal joint of his left long finger, mild tenderness to palpation over the area, and slight decreased range of motion secondary to pain. You wonder if the injury is as benign as it looks.\nDocument [12]: Title: Probable association between ziprasidone and worsening hypertension. Abstract: According to premarketing studies, at least 1% of ziprasidone-treated patients exhibited hypertension; however, this figure is not necessarily attributable to the drug. A PubMed/MEDLINE search yielded no articles describing hypertension as a possible adverse event associated with oral ziprasidone therapy. We describe a 53-year-old African-American woman with hypertension and schizophrenia whose blood pressure increased during ziprasidone therapy. She experienced no similar blood pressure increases during therapy with four other atypical antipsychotics. Her mean systolic blood pressure during ziprasidone treatment (158 mm Hg) was significantly higher than before (141 mm Hg) and after (135 mm Hg) treatment. Also, her mean diastolic blood pressure during ziprasidone treatment (88 mm Hg) was significantly higher than after treatment (79 mm Hg). Linear regression analysis demonstrated that the patient's systolic blood pressure increased significantly with ziprasidone dose (regression coefficient [B] = 0.22 mm Hg x day/mg, 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.34, p=0.001). Thus, after adjusting for the effect of antihypertensive doses, an increase of 40 mg/day in ziprasidone yielded an increase of 8.8 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure. For unknown (perhaps genetic) reasons, this patient may have been particularly sensitive to ziprasidone. Clinicians prescribing ziprasidone in patients with hypertension should be aware that their hypertension could worsen with the addition of ziprasidone. If this occurs, replacement of ziprasidone with a different antipsychotic should be considered.\nDocument [13]: Title: Late Presentation of Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection Following Cardiac Catheterization. Abstract: We report a 63-year-old female with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prior pacemaker insertion for atrial fibrillation with symptomatic bradycardia, who was admitted with substernal chest pressure and diaphoresis. Her electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with demand ventricular pacing and her cardiac biomarkers were negative for acute coronary syndrome. Echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function and normal aortic root diameter. Coronary angiography revealed 60-70% obtuse marginal lesion, otherwise mild disease. She was treated medically and discharged in stable condition. She was readmitted 1 month later with recurring chest pain, and shortness of breath which started shortly after her most recent discharge. Blood pressure was 152/93 mm Hg, and heart rate was 105 bpm. BNP was elevated at 1,400 pg/mL, and other cardiac biomarkers were negative. She was treated with diuretics, which resulted in decrease of her blood pressure to 81/51 mm Hg. Repeat echocardiogram revealed severely dilated aortic root, measuring 6.7 cm, with aortic dissection flap and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation. CT angiogram revealed aortic dissection extending proximally to the aortic root above the coronary ostia and distally to the left subclavian artery takeoff. She underwent surgery; she, however, could not be weaned off from cardiopulmonary bypass and died in the operating room. This case illustrates the importance of having a high index of suspicion for iatrogenic aortic dissection following cardiac catheterization as a cause of recurrence of cardiac symptoms, as early detection may help avert a catastrophic outcome, as we report in our patient.\nDocument [14]: Title: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children: Diagnostic and management approach. Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare neurological disorder in children. It is characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of brain parenchymal lesion, vascular malformations, hydrocephalus, or central nervous system (CNS) infection. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by high opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with exclusion of secondary causes of intracranial hypertension. If not treated properly, it may lead to severe visual dysfunction. Here we review the etiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria and management of IIH in children through illustration of the clinical and radiological presentation of a 13-year-old overweight girl who presented with severe headache, diplopia and bilateral papilledema. Otherwise, she had unremarkable neurological and systemic examinations. Lumbar puncture showed a high CSF opening pressure (360-540 mmH2O). Her investigations showed normal complete blood count (CBC), normal renal, liver, and thyroid function tests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood chemistry were unremarkable. Magnetic resonant image (MRI) of the brain demonstrated empty sella turcica, tortuous optic nerves, and flattening of the posterior sclera. Magnetic resonant venography (MRV) showed focal narrowing of the distal transverse sinuses and absence of venous sinus thrombosis. She required treatment with acetazolamide and prednisolone. With medical treatment, weight reduction, and exercise, our patient had a remarkable improvement in her symptoms with resolution of papilledema in two months. This review highlights the importance of early recognition and management of IIH to prevent permanent visual loss.\nDocument [15]: Title: Treatment of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome that Occurred in a Patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus by Plasmapheresis. Abstract: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is characterized by visual and mental disturbances, nausea and vomiting and generalized or focal convulsions and often represents itself with parietal and occipital oedema formation. We want to report the treatment of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome with plasmapheresis, which developed in a 35-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed by renal biopsy 3 years ago. She has been followed up in the intensive care unit three times. However, she had been transferred to the nephrology department of our university hospital because of her uncontrolled blood pressure. Oral antihypertensive therapy, corticosteroid 500 mg 1 \u00d7 1 and cyclophosphamide were started for the activation of lupus. After the detection of low complement levels, systemic lupus erythematosus activation was suspected. She developed mental deterioration after her first plasmapheresis treatment and was then consulted by the neurology and intensive care unit doctors. Diffusion cranial magnetic resonance imaging was found compatible with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The patient was transferred to our intensive care unit. The patient gained consciousness after her second plasmapheresis. After 5 days of follow-up in our intensive care unit and after significant regression was observed in the magnetic resonance imaging analysis, the patient was transferred to the nephrology service conscious, cooperated and orientated. At the nephrology service, after a total of 13 times of plasmapheresis, complement levels were increased and she was discharged with corticosteroid therapy. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome can be observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and intensive care unit treatment may be required. To control the hypertension, plasmapheresis should be kept in mind in addition to the multiple antihypertensive therapy in these patients.\nDocument [16]: Title: A case of sleep apnea syndrome manifesting severe hypertension with high plasma norepinephrine levels. Abstract: A 55-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with severe hypertension (274/140 mmHg). Endocrinological examination revealed that her plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE) was elevated with high levels of urinary NE, normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), suggesting the presence of pheochromocytoma. However, neither computed tomography nor MIBG scintigraphy detected any catecholamine-producing tumor in or outside the adrenal glands. She was screened with full polysomnography because of heavy snoring, and the diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was made. She was treated with calcium channel blocker for three weeks, but severe hypertension persisted. After treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was added, her blood pressure gradually lowered week by week. Concomitantly, the levels of plasma and urinary NE, urinary normetanephrine and urinary VMA were normalized following nasal CPAP therapy for 2 weeks. Additional treatments with alpha-adrenergic blocker further decreased her home blood pressure. After a year, she continued nasal CPAP therapy and her blood pressure was nearly below 160/100 mmHg. Urinary NE level was slightly above normal range and other catecholamines stayed within the normal range. This case shows that patients with OSAS could develop severe hypertension through elevated sympathetic tone, mimicking pheochromocytoma. Nasal CPAP therapy is recommended not only to improve hypertension and catecholamine excess but also to distinguish the condition from pheochromocytoma.\nDocument [17]: Title: [Power of personal goal sharing--treatment plan using personal goal maps for patients with mental disorders]. Abstract: A female patient in her sixties with schizophrenia had secretly disposed of all her medication and was not cooperating with hospital staff for about four months. During one of our consultations she mentioned that she wanted to be out of hospital by a certain date. That date happened to be her grandchild's birthday. It was at this point that she shared her goals with us, and voluntarily started having treatment. She was able to return home three months later, just in time to celebrate her grandchild's birthday with her family. A male patient in his sixties was able to leave the seclusion room after 10 years. The first doctor in charge and other hospital staff had firmly believed that releasing him from the seclusion room wasn't a possibility. However the patient decided he wanted to be discharged and was interested in finding out how to go about it. The moment he realized it was possible, his outlook changed immensely. He gradually started to open up and communicate better with his new doctor in charge, and was able to work towards his newly found goals. Staff members were also surprised when he was able to leave the seclusion room. They realized this patient was another person like them who had dreams and goals, and stopped stereotyping patients who seemed to be 'difficult to handle'. I have always experienced the power of goal sharing at clinical scenes, and have noticed its importance for patients making a start on the road to recovery. In order to discuss goals and the way to go about achieving them, I use a simple drawing of a mountain. I call this mountain 'A Personal Goal Map'. I like to think of myself (the doctor) as the mountain guide, and my patient as the mountain climber. The three key philosophies are acknowledging individuality, diversity and freedom. These are important when we think about where we are now, where we are going, and where we want to be. Firstly at the start point, we need to define the patient's problem and discuss ideas and goals, which help us along the Trust Path. The more patients and staff trust and understand each other the easier it is to climb up the Initial Treatment Path. We need to build up trustful relations so we can share personal goals and make a proper assessment and diagnosis, and talk about the safety, efficacy, cost and suitability of the initial treatment. Secondly, we need to take a rest and make more plans for the Recovery Path. It is on this path that we decide on comprehensive treatment together. We may be able to improve the patient's cognitive functions by using atypical anti-psychotic agents. We can then give them information, instructions and warnings about medicine usage so the patient is able to understand their condition. It is only after the patient can understand these things fully and act positively that we can start to climb the final path, the Achievement\nDocument [18]: Title: Diabetes and osteoporosis: Action of gastrointestinal hormones on the bone. Abstract: A 62-year-old woman consulted for evaluation of treatment for her type 2 diabetes diagnosed four years ago. He had been received treatment with metformin 850mg twice, with no chronic associated complications. She had hypertension and dyslipidemia. She was being treated with candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 32/12.5mg and atorvastatin 40mg. Her weight was 92kg and height 162cm (BMI, 35.1kg/m(2)). The last analysis showed fasting glucose 168mg/dl and glycated hemoglobin 7.5%, Microalbuminuria was negative. Blood pressure and lipid profile were within the therapeutic range. Two years ago she suffered a nontraumatic Colle's fracture in her left arm for which she was taking a daily calcium and vitamin D supplement and weekly alendronate. In summary, this is an obese female patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate metabolic control, She also has a history of fragility fracture. How should this patient be evaluated and treated?\nDocument [19]: Title: A case report of type I acute aortic intramural hematoma with localized dissection as a complication of renal artery stenting. Abstract: Percutaneous renal artery stenting has been demonstrated as an effective procedure to improve blood pressure control and preserve renal function of patients with artherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Although it is a relatively safe procedure, some serious complications, including retroperitoneal hemorrhage, atheroembolism, and arterial dissection, can occur. However, development of aortic intramural hematoma (AIH), a different clinical disease entity from the aortic dissection, has not been reported as a complication of the procedure. We report a unique case with AIH that was successfully treated with medication. A 71-year-old woman with uncontrolled hypertension underwent percutaneous renal artery stenting for treatment of the ostial stenosis of the right renal artery. Immediately after implantation of the stent, she complained of severe back pain and her systolic blood pressure dropped from 170 to 80 mm Hg. Aortography showed about 5 cm-sized localized dissection arising from the ostium of the right renal artery; however, computerized tomography (CT) scans taken immediately after the procedure revealed DeBakey type I AIH with a localized dissection from the right renal artery and pericardial effusion. Because of her refusal to take surgical intervention, which is a standard treatment, she was stabilized with intensive medical treatment. After 14 days of stabilization, AIH and pericardial effusion resolved on the follow-up CT scans. Her blood pressure was well controlled with oral antihypertensive medications and she was discharged without other complication.\nDocument [20]: Title: Arterial hypertension: second-line treatment. Try other single-agent treatments. Abstract: (1) Reliable evidence supports the use of thiazide diuretics (chlortalidone or hydrochlorothiazide) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated arterial hypertension. (2) When patients fail to reach blood pressure targets with well-conducted treatment with thiazide diuretics, or this treatment is poorly tolerated, what are the best second-line options? To answer this question, we reviewed the available evidence, based on our standard in-house methodology. (3) We found no published trials specifically designed to evaluate second-line antihypertensive treatments in cardiovascular prevention. There were no available trials of dual- versus single-agent therapy after failure of a thiazide diuretic. (4) When the blood pressure target is not reached, inadequate drug efficacy is only one of several possible causes. Various other factors affecting blood pressure should also be investigated. (5) Dual-agent therapy carries an increased risk of adverse effects and drug interactions compared to monotherapy. (6) There is no consensus among clinical practice guidelines on second-line antihypertensive therapy. However, to minimise the risk of adverse effects, it is clearly better to select single-agent therapy with a drug that has been shown to prevent cardiovascular events in first-line treatment of otherwise healthy hypertensive patients. Possible options include: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium channel blockers or betablockers. In patients over the age of 60, betablockers seem less effective that the other drugs in preventing strokes. (7) There is too little evidence to choose a specific third-line combination rather than another. However, any adverse effects that the patient experienced during prior treatments should be taken into account.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: The liver is a key metabolic organ that is particularly sensitive to environmental factors, including UV radiation. As UV radiation induces oxidative stress and inflammation, natural compounds are under investigation as one method to counteract these consequences. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of topical application of phytocannabinoid-cannabidiol (CBD) on the skin of nude rats chronically irradiated with UVA/UVB, paying particular attention to its impact on the liver antioxidants and phospholipid metabolism. The results of this study indicate that CBD reaches the rat liver where it is then metabolized into decarbonylated cannabidiol, 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol and cannabidiol-glucuronide. CBD increased the levels of GSH and vitamin A after UVB radiation. Moreover, CBD prevents the increase of 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-iso-prostaglandin-F<sub>2&#945;</sub> levels in UVA-irradiated rats. As a consequence of reductions in phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenases activity following UV irradiation, CBD upregulates the level of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and downregulates prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4. Finally, CBD enhances decreased level of 15-deoxy-&#916;-12,14-prostaglandin J2 after UVB radiation and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid after UVA radiation. These data show that CBD applied to the skin prevents ROS- and enzyme-dependent phospholipid metabolism in the liver of UV-irradiated rats, suggesting that it may be used as an internal organ protector.\nDocument [2]: Title: Characterization of major phytocannabinoids, cannabidiol and cannabinol, as isoform-selective and potent inhibitors of human CYP1 enzymes. Abstract: Inhibitory effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol (CBN), the three major constituents in marijuana, on catalytic activities of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 enzymes were investigated. These cannabinoids inhibited 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity of recombinant CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 in a competitive manner. CBD most potently inhibited the CYP1A1 activity; the apparent K(i) value (0.155microM) was at least one-seventeenth of the values for other CYP1 isoforms. On the other hand, CBN more effectively decreased the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 (K(i)=0.0790 and 0.148microM, respectively) compared with CYP1A1 (K(i)=0.541microM). Delta(9)-THC less potently inhibited the CYP1 activity than CBD and CBN, and showed low selectivity against the CYP1 inhibition (K(i)=2.47-7.54microM). The preincubation of CBD resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in catalytic activity of all the recombinant CYP1 enzymes and human liver microsomes. Similarly, the preincubation of Delta(9)-THC or CBN caused a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of recombinant CYP1A1. The inactivation of CYP1A1 by CBD indicated the highest k(inact)/K(I) value (540l/mmol/min) among the CYP1 enzyme sources tested. The inactivation of recombinant CYP1A1 and human liver microsomes by CBD required NADPH, was not influenced by dialysis and by glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, and superoxide dismutase as trapping agents. These results indicated that CBD and CBN showed CYP1 isoform-selective direct inhibition and that CBD was characterized as a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of human CYP1 enzymes, especially CYP1A1.\nDocument [3]: Title: Cytochrome P450-Catalyzed Metabolism of Cannabidiol to the Active Metabolite 7-Hydroxy-Cannabidiol. Abstract: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a naturally occurring nonpsychotoxic phytocannabinoid that has gained increasing attention as a popular consumer product and for its use in Food and Drug Administration-approved Epidiolex (CBD oral solution) for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. CBD was previously reported to be metabolized primarily by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, with minor contributions from UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. 7-Hydroxy-CBD (7-OH-CBD) is the primary active metabolite with equipotent activity compared with CBD. Given the polymorphic nature of <i>CYP2C19</i>, we hypothesized that variable CYP2C19 expression may lead to interindividual differences in CBD metabolism to 7-OH-CBD. The objectives of this study were to further characterize the roles of cytochrome P450 enzymes in CBD metabolism, specifically to the active metabolite 7-OH-CBD, and to investigate the impact of <i>CYP2C19</i> polymorphism on CBD metabolism in genotyped human liver microsomes. The results from reaction phenotyping experiments with recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes and cytochrome P450-selective chemical inhibitors indicated that both CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 are capable of CBD metabolism to 7-OH-CBD. CYP3A played a major role in CBD metabolic clearance via oxidation at sites other than the 7-position. In genotyped human liver microsomes, 7-OH-CBD formation was positively correlated with CYP2C19 activity but was not associated with <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype. In a subset of single-donor human liver microsomes with moderate to low CYP2C19 activity, CYP2C9 inhibition significantly reduced 7-OH-CBD formation, suggesting that CYP2C9 may play a greater role in CBD 7-hydroxylation than previously thought. Collectively, these data indicate that both CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 are important contributors in CBD metabolism to the active metabolite 7-OH-CBD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrates that both CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 are involved in CBD metabolism to the active metabolite 7-OH-CBD and that CYP3A4 is a major contributor to CBD metabolism through pathways other than 7-hydroxylation. 7-OH-CBD formation was associated with human liver microsomal CYP2C19 activity, but not <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype, and CYP2C9 was found to contribute significantly to 7-OH-CBD generation. These findings have implications for patients taking CBD who may be at risk for clinically important cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions.\nDocument [4]: Title: EUS yield in evaluating biliary dilatation in patients with normal serum liver enzymes. Abstract: The finding of common bile duct (CBD) dilatation on abdominal imaging frequently results in additional testing. It has been our impression that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) evaluation of a dilated CBD is a low-yield examination in the setting of normal serum liver enzymes. We therefore sought to evaluate the EUS yield in evaluating CBD dilatation in patients with normal as compared to elevated serum liver enzymes. A retrospective review was performed to identify patients referred for EUS evaluation of a dilated CBD in the absence of obvious pathology on prior imaging. Charts were reviewed for patient symptoms, presence of elevated serum liver enzymes, imaging studies before EUS, and EUS findings. Exclusion criteria included clinical jaundice, known biliary stricture, mass lesion or stone, and previously sphincterotomy and/or stent placement. Forty-seven patients were identified: 32 with normal and 15 with elevated serum liver enzymes. There was no difference in mean CBD diameter between these two groups (8.51 vs. 8.79 mm, p=0.854). Of the entire group, 15 patients had undergone prior magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP); an additional 7 patients had undergone prior endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). EUS findings to explain CBD dilatation were found more commonly in patients with elevated compared with normal serum liver enzymes (53% vs. 6%, p=0.001). Periampullary diverticula and choledocholithiasis were the most common findings; of 32 patients with normal serum liver enzymes, one periampullary diverticulum and one CBD stone were found, respectively. The CBD stone had been missed by prior MRCP examination. Of 15 patients with elevated serum liver enzymes, there were 3 cases of choledocholithiasis, 4 periampullary diverticula, and 1 ampullary tumor. EUS should be the test of choice for further evaluation of CBD dilatation when index imaging is normal. Although the EUS yield is low in cases of biliary dilatation in the setting of normal serum liver enzymes, its preferential use would potentially avoid unnecessary MRCP and ERCP.\nDocument [5]: Title: Cannabidiol attenuates alcohol-induced liver steatosis, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation and neutrophil-mediated injury. Abstract: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of marijuana, which has anti-inflammatory effects. It has also been approved by FDA for various orphan diseases for exploratory trials. Herein, we investigated the effects of CBD on liver injury induced by chronic plus binge alcohol feeding in mice. CBD or vehicle was administered daily throughout the alcohol feeding study. At the conclusion of the feeding protocol, serums samples, livers or isolated neutrophils were utilized for molecular biology, biochemistry and pathology analysis. CBD significantly attenuated the alcohol feeding-induced serum transaminase elevations, hepatic inflammation (mRNA expressions of TNF\u03b1, MCP1, IL1\u03b2, MIP2 and E-Selectin, and neutrophil accumulation), oxidative/nitrative stress (lipid peroxidation, 3-nitrotyrosine formation, and expression of reactive oxygen species generating enzyme NOX2). CBD treatment also attenuated the respiratory burst of neutrophils isolated from chronic plus binge alcohol fed mice or from human blood, and decreased the alcohol-induced increased liver triglyceride and fat droplet accumulation. Furthermore, CBD improved alcohol-induced hepatic metabolic dysregulation and steatosis by restoring changes in hepatic mRNA or protein expression of ACC-1, FASN, PPAR\u03b1, MCAD, ADIPOR-1, and mCPT-1. Thus, CBD may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of alcoholic liver diseases associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and steatosis, which deserves exploration in human trials.\nDocument [6]: Title: Cannabidiol protects livers against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis induced by high-fat high cholesterol diet via regulating NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Abstract: Cannabidiol (CBD), an abundant nonpsychoactive constituent of marijuana, has been reported previously to protect against hepatic steatosis. In this study, we studied further the functions and mechanisms of CBD on liver inflammation induced by HFC diet. Mice feeding an HFC diet for 8 weeks were applied to test the protective effect of CBD on livers. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with LPS + ATP \u00b1 CBD to study the mechanisms of the effect of CBD against inflammasome activation. We found that CBD alleviated liver inflammation induced by HFC diet. CBD significantly inhibited the nuclear factor-\u03baappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 nuclear translocation and the activation of nucleotide-binding domain like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome both in vivo and in vitro studies, which lead to the reduction of the expression of inflammation-related factors in our studies. In addition, Inhibitor of activation of NF-\u03baB partly suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, while adding CBD further inhibited NF-\u03baB activation and correspondingly suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. In conclusion, the suppression of the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through deactivation of NF-\u03baB in macrophages by CBD might be one mechanism of its anti-inflammatory function in the liver.\nDocument [7]: Title: A Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Model for Cannabidiol in Healthy Adults, Hepatically-Impaired Adults, and Children. Abstract: Cannabidiol (CBD) is available as a prescription oral drug that is indicated for the treatment of some types of epilepsy in children and adults. CBD is also available over-the-counter and is used to self-treat a variety of other ailments, including pain, anxiety, and insomnia. Accordingly, CBD may be consumed with other medications, resulting in possible CBD-drug interactions. Such interactions can be predicted in healthy and hepatically-impaired (HI) adults and in children through physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation. These PBPK models must be populated with CBD-specific parameters, including the enzymes that metabolize CBD in adults. In vitro reaction phenotyping experiments showed that UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs, 80%), particularly UGT2B7 (64%), were the major contributors to CBD metabolism in adult human liver microsomes. Among the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) tested, CYP2C19 (5.7%) and CYP3A (6.5%) were the major CYPs responsible for CBD metabolism. Using these and other physicochemical parameters, a CBD PBPK model was developed and validated for healthy adults. This model was then extended to predict CBD systemic exposure in HI adults and children. Our PBPK model successfully predicted CBD systemic exposure in both populations within 0.5- to 2-fold of the observed values. In conclusion, we developed and validated a PBPK model to predict CBD systemic exposure in healthy and HI adults and children. This model can be used to predict CBD-drug or CBD-drug-disease interactions in these populations. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Our PBPK model successfully predicted CBD systemic exposure in healthy and hepatically-impaired adults, as well as children with epilepsy. This model could be used in the future to predict CBD-drug or CBD-drug-disease interactions in these special populations.\nDocument [8]: Title: Identification of cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolism of cannabidiol by human liver microsomes. Abstract: Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the major constituents in marijuana, has been shown to be extensively metabolized by experimental animals and humans. However, human hepatic enzymes responsible for the CBD metabolism remain to be elucidated. In this study, we examined in vitro metabolism of CBD with human liver microsomes (HLMs) to clarify cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms involved in the CBD oxidations.\nDocument [9]: Title: Cannabidiol and Cannabidiol Metabolites: Pharmacokinetics, Interaction with Food, and Influence on Liver Function. Abstract: Cannabidiol (CBD) is widely available and marketed as having therapeutic properties. Over-the-counter CBD is unregulated, many of the therapeutic claims lack scientific support, and controversy exists as to the safety of CBD-liver interaction. The study aims were to compare the pharmacokinetics of commercial CBD and CBD metabolites following the ingestion of five different CBD formulations, determine the influence of CBD on food induced thermogenesis, determine the influence of food on CBD pharmacokinetics, and determine the influence of CBD on markers of liver function. Fourteen males (body mass index &#8805; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were studied in a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover design. On five occasions, different CBD formulations were ingested (one per visit). On two additional occasions, CBD or placebo was ingested following a meal. CBD servings were standardized to 30 mg. Considerable pharmacokinetic variability existed between formulations; this pharmacokinetic variability transferred to several of the metabolites. CBD did not influence food induced thermogenesis but did favorably modify early insulin and triglyceride responses. Food appreciably altered the pharmacokinetics of CBD. Finally, CBD did not evoke physiologically relevant changes in markers of liver function. Collectively, these data suggest that consumers should be aware of the appreciable pharmacokinetic differences between commercial CBD formulations, CBD is unlikely to influence the caloric cost of eating but may prove to be of some benefit to initial metabolic responses, consuming CBD with food alters the dynamics of CBD metabolism and increases systemic availability, and low-dose CBD probably does not represent a risk to normal liver function.\nDocument [10]: Title: Cannabidiol (CBD) Dosing: Plasma Pharmacokinetics and Effects on Accumulation in Skeletal Muscle, Liver and Adipose Tissue. Abstract: Oral cannabidiol (CBD) consumption is widespread in North America and Europe, as it has analgesic, neuroprotective and antitumor effects. Although oral CBD consumption in humans affords beneficial effects in epileptic and inflammatory states, its pharmacokinetics and subsequent uptake into tissue are largely unknown. This study investigated plasma pharmacokinetics and accumulation of CBD in gastrocnemius muscle, liver and adipose tissue in adult rats following oral gavage. CBD was fed relative to body mass at 0 (control), 30, 115, or 230 mg/Kg/day for 28 days; with 6 males and 6 females per dosing group. Pharmacokinetics were assessed on day 1 and day 28 in the group receiving CBD at 115 mg/Kg/day. The rise in tissue CBD was closely related to specific pharmacokinetic parameters, and adipose tissue levels were ~10 to ~100 fold greater than liver or muscle. Tissue CBD levels were moderately correlated between adipose and muscle, and adipose and liver, but were highly correlated for liver and muscle. CBD feeding resulted in several gender-specific effects, including changes in pharmacokinetics, relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and tissue CBD and differences in tissue CBD levels. CBD accumulation in mammalian tissues has the potential to influence receptor binding and metabolism; therefore, the present findings may have relevance for developing oral dosing regimens.\nDocument [11]: Title: Cannabidiol and cannabidiolic acid: Preliminary in vitro evaluation of metabolism and drug-drug interactions involving canine cytochrome P-450, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and P-glycoprotein. Abstract: Phytocannabinoid-rich hemp extracts containing cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) are increasingly being used to treat various disorders in dogs. The objectives of this study were to obtain preliminary information regarding the in vitro metabolism of these compounds and their capacity to inhibit canine cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug metabolism and canine P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Pure CBD and CBDA, and hemp extracts enriched for CBD and for CBDA were evaluated. Substrate depletion assays using pooled dog liver microsomes showed CYP cofactor-dependent depletion of CBD (but not CBDA) and UDP-glucuronosytransferase cofactor-dependent depletion of CBDA (but not CBD) indicating major roles for CYP and UDP-glucuronosytransferase in the metabolism of these phytocannabinoids, respectively. Further studies using recombinant canine CYPs demonstrated substantial CBD depletion by the major hepatic P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C21. These results were confirmed by showing increased CBD depletion by liver microsomes from dogs treated with a known CYP1A2 inducer (&#946;-naphthoflavone) and with a known CYP2C21 inducer (phenobarbital). Cannabinoid-drug inhibition experiments showed inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> &#8201;=&#8201;4.6-8.1&#8201;&#956;M) of tramadol metabolism via CYP2B11-mediated N-demethylation (CBD and CBDA) and CYP2D15-mediated O-demethylation (CBDA only) by dog liver microsomes. CBD and CBDA did not inhibit CYP3A12-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (IC<sub>50</sub> &#8201;&gt;&#8201;10&#8201;&#956;M). CBD and CBDA were not substrates or competitive inhibitors of canine P-glycoprotein. Results for cannabinoid-enriched hemp extracts were identical to those for pure cannabinoids. These in vitro studies indicate the potential for cannabinoid-drug interactions involving certain CYPs (but not P-glycoprotein). Confirmatory in vivo studies are warranted.\nDocument [12]: Title: Cytosolic Enzymes Generate Cannabinoid Metabolites 7-Carboxycannabidiol and 11-Nor-9-carboxytetrahydrocannabinol. Abstract: The cannabinoids cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) undergo extensive oxidative metabolism in the liver. Although cytochromes P450 form the primary, pharmacologically active, hydroxylated metabolites of CBD and THC, less is known about the enzymes that generate the major <i>in vivo</i> circulating metabolites of CBD and THC, 7-carboxy-CBD and 11-carboxy-THC, respectively. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the enzymes involved in forming these metabolites. Cofactor dependence experiments with human liver subcellular fractions revealed that 7-carboxy-CBD and 11-carboxy-THC formation is largely dependent on cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes, with lesser contributions from NADPH-dependent microsomal enzymes. Experiments with chemical inhibitors provided evidence that 7-carboxy-CBD formation is mainly dependent on aldehyde dehydrogenases and 11-carboxy-THC formation is mediated also in part by aldehyde oxidase. This study is the first to demonstrate the involvement of cytosolic drug-metabolizing enzymes in generating major <i>in vivo</i> metabolites of CBD and THC and addresses a knowledge gap in cannabinoid metabolism.\nDocument [13]: Title: Inhibition of Nicotine Metabolism by Cannabidiol (CBD) and 7-Hydroxycannabidiol (7-OH-CBD). Abstract: Cannabis-based products have experienced notable increases in co-usage alongside tobacco products. Several cannabinoids exhibit inhibition of a number of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, but few studies have examined their inhibition of enzymes involved in nicotine metabolism. The goal of the present study was to examine potential drug-drug interactions occurring in the nicotine metabolism pathway perpetrated by cannabidiol (CBD) and its active metabolite, 7-hydroxy-CBD (7-OH-CBD). The inhibitory effects of CBD and 7-OH-CBD were tested in microsomes from HEK293 cells overexpressing individual metabolizing enzymes and from human liver tissue. Assays with overexpressing microsomes demonstrated that CBD and 7-OH-CBD inhibited CYP-mediated nicotine metabolism. Binding-corrected IC<sub>50,u</sub> values for CBD inhibition of nicotine metabolism to cotinine and nornicotine, and cotinine metabolism to <i>trans</i>-3'-hydroxycotinine (3HC), were 0.27 &#177; 0.060, 0.23 &#177; 0.14, and 0.21 &#177; 0.14 &#956;M, respectively, for CYP2A6; and 0.26 &#177; 0.17 and 0.029 &#177; 0.0050 &#956;M for cotinine and nornicotine formation, respectively, for CYP2B6. 7-OH-CBD IC<sub>50,u</sub> values were 0.45 &#177; 0.18, 0.16 &#177; 0.08, and 0.78 &#177; 0.23 &#956;M for cotinine, nornicotine, and 3HC formation, respectively, for CYP2A6, and 1.2 &#177; 0.44 and 0.11 &#177; 0.030 &#956;M for cotinine and nornicotine formation, respectively, for CYP2B6. Similar IC<sub>50,u</sub> values were observed in HLM. Inhibition (IC<sub>50,u</sub> = 0.37 &#177; 0.06 &#956;M) of 3HC to 3HC-glucuronide formation by UGT1A9 was demonstrated by CBD. Significant inhibition of nicotine metabolism pathways by CBD and 7-OH-CBD suggests that cannabinoids may inhibit nicotine metabolism, potentially impacting tobacco addiction and cessation.\nDocument [14]: Title: Therapeutic Prospects of Cannabidiol for Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol-Related Damages on the Liver and the Brain. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Cannabidiol (CBD) is a natural component of cannabis that possesses a widespread and complex immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anxiolytic, and antiepileptic properties. Much experimental data suggest that CBD could be used for various purposes in alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-related damage on the brain and the liver. <b>Aim:</b> To provide a rationale for using CBD to treat human subjects with AUD, based on the findings of experimental studies. <b>Methods:</b> Narrative review of studies pertaining to the assessment of CBD efficiency on drinking reduction, or on the improvement of any aspect of alcohol-related toxicity in AUD. <b>Results:</b> Experimental studies find that CBD reduces the overall level of alcohol drinking in animal models of AUD by reducing ethanol intake, motivation for ethanol, relapse, anxiety, and impulsivity. Moreover, CBD reduces alcohol-related steatosis and fibrosis in the liver by reducing lipid accumulation, stimulating autophagy, modulating inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and by inducing death of activated hepatic stellate cells. Finally, CBD reduces alcohol-related brain damage, preventing neuronal loss by its antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties. <b>Conclusions:</b> CBD could directly reduce alcohol drinking in subjects with AUD. Any other applications warrant human trials in this population. By reducing alcohol-related steatosis processes in the liver, and alcohol-related brain damage, CBD could improve both hepatic and neurocognitive outcomes in subjects with AUD, regardless of the individual's drinking trajectory. This might pave the way for testing new harm reduction approaches in AUD, in order to protect the organs of subjects with an ongoing AUD.\nDocument [15]: Title: Cannabidiol and Abnormal Liver Chemistries in Healthy Adults: Results of a Phase I Clinical Trial. Abstract: Liver safety concerns were raised in randomized controlled trials of cannabidiol (CBD) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes, but the relevance of these concerns to healthy adults consuming CBD is unclear. The objective of this manuscript is to report on liver safety findings from healthy adults who received therapeutic daily doses of CBD for ~ 3.5 weeks and to investigate any correlation between transaminase elevations and baseline characteristics, pharmacogenetic, and pharmacokinetic data. Sixteen healthy adults were enrolled in a phase I, open-label, fixed single-sequence drug-drug interaction trial to investigate the effect of repeated dose administration of CBD (1,500 mg/day) on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity. Seven (44%) participants experienced peak serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN). For five (31%) participants, the value exceeded 5 \u00d7 ULN, therefore meeting the international consensus criteria for drug-induced liver injury. There was no correlation between transaminase elevations and baseline characteristics, CYP2C19 genotype, or CBD plasma concentrations. All ALT elevations above the ULN began within 2-4 weeks of initial exposure to CBD. Among the six participants with ALT elevations who were discontinued from the protocol, some had symptoms consistent with hepatitis or hypersensitivity. We conclude that healthy adults consuming CBD may experience elevations in serum ALT consistent with drug-induced liver injury. Given the demonstrated interindividual variation in susceptibility, clinicians should be alert to this potential effect from CBD, which is increasingly available in various nonprescription forms and doses to consumers.\nDocument [16]: Title: Cannabidiol Inhibits <i>In Vitro</i> Human Liver Microsomal Metabolism of Remdesivir. Abstract: <b>Introduction:</b> The year 2020 began with the world being flounced with a wave of novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) disease, named COVID-19. Based on promising pre-clinical and clinical data, remdesivir (RDV) was the first drug to receive FDA approval and so far, it is the most common therapy for treatment of SARS-CoV-2/MERS-CoV. However, following intravenous administration, RDV metabolizes majorly by human liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and marginally by the CYP3A4 enzyme in merely less than an hour. Its resultant active metabolite is a hydrophilic nucleoside with very limited accumulation within lung tissues. Therefore, there is a need to investigate strategies to overcome such premature metabolism issues and improve the antiviral efficacy of RDV at the target site. <b>Objective:</b> Considering the major CES1-mediated metabolism of RDV on systemic administration, we intend to explore the remarkable CES1 plus CYP3A4 inhibitory activity of cannabidiol (CBD) against <i>in vitro</i> microsomal metabolism of RDV to indicate its therapeutic potential as an adjuvant to RDV in the treatment and management of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We investigated the <i>in vitro</i> human liver microsomal metabolism of RDV in the presence of two potential CES1 inhibitors-CBD and nelfinavir, and two standard CYP3A4 inhibitors-ritonavir (RITO) and cyclosporin A. The microsomal metabolism assay was further validated by using a well-characterized CYP3A4-selective substrate, midazolam (MDZ), in the presence of CBD and RITO. <b>Results:</b> Our findings depicted that RDV was rapidly and completely metabolized by human liver microsomes within 60&#8201;min. Coincubation with CBD substantially reduced microsomal metabolism of RDV and prolonged its <i>in vitro</i> half-life from 8.93 to 31.07&#8201;min. CBD showed significantly higher inhibition of RDV compared with known CES1 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. Inhibition of MDZ metabolism by CBD and RITO further validated the assay. <b>Conclusions:</b> The current study strongly suggests that CBD significantly inhibits human liver microsomal metabolism of RDV and extends its <i>in vitro</i> half-life. Thus, concomitant administration of CBD with RDV intravenous injection could be a promising strategy to prevent premature metabolism in COVID-19 patients.\nDocument [17]: Title: Paradoxical Patterns of Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome-Like Liver Injury in Aged Female CD-1 Mice Triggered by Cannabidiol-Rich Cannabis Extract and Acetaminophen Co-Administration. Abstract: The goal of this study was to investigate the potential for a cannabidiol-rich cannabis extract (CRCE) to interact with the most common over-the-counter drug and the major known cause of drug-induced liver injury-acetaminophen (APAP)-in aged female CD-1 mice. Gavaging mice with 116 mg/kg of cannabidiol (CBD) [mouse equivalent dose (MED) of 10 mg/kg of CBD] in CRCE delivered with sesame oil for three consecutive days followed by intraperitoneally (i.p.) acetaminophen (APAP) administration (400 mg/kg) on day 4 resulted in overt toxicity with 37.5% mortality. No mortality was observed in mice treated with 290 mg/kg of CBD+APAP (MED of 25 mg/kg of CBD) or APAP alone. Following CRCE/APAP co-administration, microscopic examination revealed a sinusoidal obstruction syndrome-like liver injury-the severity of which correlated with the degree of alterations in physiological and clinical biochemistry end points. Mechanistically, glutathione depletion and oxidative stress were observed between the APAP-only and co-administration groups, but co-administration resulted in much greater activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Strikingly, these effects were not observed in mice gavaged with 290 mg/kg CBD in CRCE followed by APAP administration. These findings highlight the potential for CBD/drug interactions, and reveal an interesting paradoxical effect of CBD/APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.\nDocument [18]: Title: Pharmacogenetic Predictors of Cannabidiol Response and Tolerability in Treatment-Resistant Epilepsy. Abstract: In patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy (TRE), cannabidiol (CBD) produces variable improvement in seizure control. Patients in the University of Alabama at Birmingham CBD Expanded Access Program (EAP) were enrolled in the genomic study and genotyped using the Affymetrix Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters plus array. Associations between variants and CBD response (&#8805;50% seizure reduction) and tolerability (diarrhea, sedation, and abnormal liver function) was evaluated under dominant and recessive models. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) influencing potential CBD targets was evaluated in the UK Brain Expression Consortium data set (Braineac), and genetic co-expression examined. Of 169 EAP patients, 112 (54.5% pediatric and 50.0% female) were included in the genetic analyses. Patients with AOX1 rs6729738 CC (aldehyde oxidase; odds ratio (OR) 6.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.19-20.41, P&#160;=&#160;0.001) or ABP1 rs12539 (diamine oxidase; OR 3.96, 95% CI 1.62-9.73, P&#160;=&#160;0.002) were more likely to respond. Conversely, patients with SLC15A1 rs1339067 TT had lower odds of response (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.56, P&#160;=&#160;0.001). ABCC5 rs3749442 was associated with lower likelihood of response and abnormal liver function tests, and higher likelihood of sedation. The eQTL revealed that rs1339067 decreased GPR18 expression (endocannabinoid receptor) in white matter (P&#160;=&#160;5.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>-3</sup> ), and rs3749442 decreased hippocampal HTR3E expression (serotonin 5-HT<sub>3E</sub> ; P&#160;=&#160;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>-5</sup> ). Furthermore, 75% of genes associated with lower likelihood of response were co-expressed. Pharmacogenetic variation is associated with CBD response and influences expression of CBD targets in TRE. Implicated pathways, including cholesterol metabolism and glutathione conjugation, demonstrate potential interactions between CBD and common medications (e.g., statins and acetaminophen) that may require closer monitoring. These results highlight the role of pharmacogenes in fundamental biologic processes and potential genetic underpinnings of treatment-resistance.\nDocument [19]: Title: Cannabidiol-based natural health products for companion animals: Recent advances in the management of anxiety, pain, and inflammation. Abstract: Recent advances in cannabidiol (CBD) use in canines and felines for anxiety management, pain management, and anti-inflammatory effects were reviewed using a literature search conducted with the following keywords: CBD, anxiety, inflammation, pain, dogs, cats, and companion animals. For decades, research on CBD has been hindered due to the status of cannabis (C. sativa L.) as an illicit drug. Limited safety data show that CBD is well-tolerated in dogs, with insufficient information on the safety profile of CBD in cats. Upon oral supplementation of CBD, elevation in liver enzymes was observed for both dogs and cats, and pharmacokinetics of CBD are different in the two species. There is a significant gap in the literature on the therapeutic use of CBD in cats, with no feline data on anxiety, pain, and inflammation management. There is evidence that chronic osteoarthritic pain in dogs can be reduced by supplementation with CBD. Furthermore, experiments are required to better understand whether CBD has an influence on noise-induced fear and anxiolytic response. Preliminary evidence exists to support the analgesic properties of CBD in treating chronic canine osteoarthritis; however, there are inter- and intra-species differences in pharmacokinetics, tolerance, dosage, and safety of CBD. Therefore, to validate the anxiety management, pain management, and anti-inflammatory efficacy of CBD, it is essential to conduct systematic, randomized, and controlled trials. Further, the safety and efficacious dose of CBD in companion animals warrants investigation.\nDocument [20]: Title: The Use of Cannabidiol in Metabolic Syndrome-An Opportunity to Improve the Patient's Health or Much Ado about Nothing? Abstract: Cannabis-derived therapies are gaining popularity in the medical world. More and more perfect forms of cannabinoids are sought, which could be used in the treatment of many common diseases, including metabolic syndrome, whose occurrence is also increasing. The purpose of this review was to investigate the usefulness of cannabinoids, mainly cannabidiol (CBD), in individuals with obesity, impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, high blood pressure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We summarised the most recent research on the broad topic of cannabis-derived influence on metabolic syndrome components. Since there is a lot of work on the effects of \u03949-THC (\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol) on metabolism and far less on cannabidiol, we felt it needed to be sorted out and summarised in this review. The research results on the use of cannabidiol in obesity are contraindicatory. When it comes to glucose homeostasis, it appears that CBD maintains it, sensitises adipose tissue to insulin, and reduces fasting glucose levels, so it seems to be a potential target in this kind of metabolic disorder, but some research results are inconclusive. CBD shows some promising results in the treatment of various lipid disorders. Some studies have proven its positive effect by decreasing LDL and increasing HDL as well. Despite their probable efficacy, CBD and its derivatives will likely remain an adjunctive treatment rather than a mainstay of therapy. Studies have also shown that CBD in patients with hypertension has positive effects, even though the hypotensive properties of cannabidiol are small. However, CBD can be used to prevent blood pressure surges, stabilise them, and have a protective effect on blood vessels. Results from preclinical studies have shown that the effect of cannabidiol on NAFLD may be potentially beneficial in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome and its components. Nevertheless, there is limited data on CBD and NAFLD in human studies. Because of the numerous confounding factors, the conclusions are unclear, and more research in this field is required.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",

Abstract: Conventionally the packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion volume given to neonates is 10 ml/kg to 20 ml/kg. The weight-based formulae underestimate the volume of PRBC required to achieve a target hematocrit (Hct) in preterm neonates. The study was done to compare the rise in Hct after transfusing PRBC volume calculated either based on body weight or using formula considering Hct of blood bag and Hct of preterm neonates. This prospective study included a total of 68 preterm neonates requiring transfusion for the first time having \u2264 34 weeks of gestational age. Neonates were randomized using block randomization, to receive 15 ml/kg of PRBC transfusion (group A) or transfusion based on the formula (group B). The primary outcome of interest was post-transfusion rise in hematocrit. The secondary outcome was the effect of transfusion on neonatal morbidities in terms of retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death. Baseline variables (birth weight, gestation age, APGAR score and score of neonatal acute physiology) pre-transfusion hemodynamics and hematocrit of the bag were comparable in both groups. The mean volume of PRBC in group A was 18.8 \u00b1 4.9 ml, whereas in group B it was 29.6 \u00b1 7.3 ml, p = 0.0001. Group B transfusions had a statistically significant change in 24 h post-transfusion hematocrit. Secondary outcomes were comparable in two groups. Post transfusion rise in Hct of the patient in group B was significant as compared to group A. The study needed huge sample size to establish a difference in the number of re-transfusions required across two groups. The trial was registered under the clinical trial registry of India (CTRI/2018/01/011,063).\nDocument [2]: Title: Nonsurgical bleeding diathesis in anemic thrombocytopenic patients: role of temperature, red blood cells, platelets, and plasma-clotting proteins. Abstract: Research at the Naval Blood Research Laboratory (Boston, MA) for the past four decades has focused on the preservation of red blood cells (RBCs), platelets (PLTs), and plasma-clotting proteins to treat wounded servicemen suffering blood loss. We have studied the survival and function of fresh and preserved RBCs and PLTs and the function of fresh and frozen plasma-clotting proteins. This report summarizes our peer-reviewed publications on the effects of temperature, RBCs, PLTs, and plasma-clotting proteins on the bleeding time (BT) and nonsurgical blood loss. The term nonsurgical blood loss refers to generalized, systemic bleeding that is not corrected by surgical interventions. We observed that the BT correlated with the volume of shed blood collected at the BT site and to the nonsurgical blood loss in anemic thrombocytopenic patients after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Many factors influence the BT, including temperature; hematocrit (Hct); PLT count; PLT size; PLT function; and the plasma-clotting proteins factor (F)VIII, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen level. Our laboratory has studied temperature, Hct, PLT count, PLT size, and PLT function in studies performed in non-aspirin-treated and aspirin-treated volunteers, in aspirin-treated baboons, and in anemic thrombocytopenic patients. This monograph discusses the role of RBCs and PLTs in the restoration of hemostasis, in the hope that a better understanding of the hemostatic mechanism might improve the treatment of anemic thrombocytopenic patients. Data from our studies have demonstrated that it is important to transfuse anemic thrombocytopenic patients with RBCs that have satisfactory viability and function to achieve a Hct level of 35 vol percent before transfusing viable and functional PLTs. The Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) Collaborative recommends that preserved PLTs have an in vivo recovery of 66 percent of that of fresh PLTs and a life span that is at least 50 percent that of fresh PLTs. Their recommendation does not include any indication that preserved PLTs must be able to function to reduce the BT and reduce or prevent nonsurgical blood loss. One of the hemostatic effects of RBC is to scavenge endothelial cell nitric oxide, a vasodilating agent that inhibits PLT function. In addition, endothelin may be released from endothelial cells, a potent vasoconstrictor substance,to reduce blood flow at the BT site. RBCs, like PLTs at the BT site, may provide arachidonic acid and adenosine diphosphate to stimulate the PLTs to make thromboxane, another potent vasoconstrictor substance and a PLT-aggregating substance. At the BT site, the PLTs and RBCs are activated and phosphatidyl serine is exposed on both the PLTs and the RBCs. FVa and FXa, which generate prothrombinase activity to produce thrombin, accumulate on the PLTs and RBCs. A Hct level of 35 vol percent at the BT site minimizes shear stress and reduces nitric oxide produced by endothelial cells. The transfusion trigger for prophylactic PLT transfusion should consider both the Hct and the PLT count. The transfusion of RBCs that are both viable and functional to anemic thrombocytopenic patients may reduce the need for prophylactic leukoreduced PLTs, the\nDocument [3]: Title: The Effect of Preoperative Hematocrit Levels on Early Outcomes After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft. Abstract: Introduction Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is the most potent of surgical procedures; in this procedure, the narrowing of the coronary artery due to atherosclerotic plaque is bypassed by forming an alternate route for blood flow to the heart. There are various risk factors associated with the procedure. The aim of this study was to observe if postoperative outcomes are affected by preoperative hematocrit (hct) levels in patients. Methods This longitudinal study was conducted from April 2019 to December 2019. Eighty-two (82) participants who were to undergo CABG surgery were divided into two groups based on their preoperative hct levels. Group 1 had 42 participants with lower levels of hct (less than 35.5% for women and 38.3% for men), whereas group 2 consisted of 40 participants with normal hct levels (greater than 35.5% for women and 38.3% for men). Results The results showed that participants undergoing CABG with lower than normal hct levels had increased blood loss through drainage as compared to participants who had normal hct levels (680.1 \u00b1 301 mL vs. 500.7 \u00b1 412 mL; p-value: 0.02). Group 1 participants also had an increased need for blood and blood product transfusion as compared to group 2 (3.2 \u00b1 1.8 units vs. 1.8 \u00b1 0.9 units; p-value: <0.0001). Furthermore, the participants in group 1 had longer stays in the ICU relative to the other group (5.2 \u00b1 3.1 days vs. 3.4 \u00b1 2.5 days; p-value: 0.003). Conclusion Based on our findings, patients who undergo CABG surgery with lower than normal hct levels are at increased risk of certain complications, including excessive blood loss, need for transfusion, and increased duration of ICU stay. Therefore, preoperative hct levels should be routinely checked in patients undergoing CABG to prevent these complications.\nDocument [4]: Title: A comparative study of combined intravenous and topical administration of tranexamic acid with topical tranexamic acid alone for blood loss reduction after primary uncemented total hip arthroplasty. Abstract: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of topical versus combined (intravenous + topical) tranexamic acid (TXA) to reduce perioperative blood loss after uncemented primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Seventy-five patients were randomized in three comparable experimental groups: 1) topical TXA (3 g in 50 ml of saline solution); 2) intravenous + topical TXA (3 g topical + 2 g in 100 ml of saline solution intravenously); 3) controls. Pre- and post-operative hemoglobin (Hb) levels and hematocrit (Hct) values along with the rate of blood transfusion in the 3 groups were compared. The intravenous + topical TXA group demonstrated higher Hb levels and Hct values at postoperative day one (Hb = p <0.05, Hct = p <0.001), postoperative day three (Hb = p <0.05, Hct = p <0.001), and discharge (Hct = p <0.01) compared to the control group. The intravenous + topical group had a lower transfusion rate compared to the control group (0% vs 20%, p = 0.014). With the numbers available, no difference in postoperative Hb level and transfusion rate emerged between topical TXA and control group.\nDocument [5]: Title: Platelet and red blood cell utilization and transfusion independence in umbilical cord blood and allogeneic peripheral blood hematopoietic cell transplants. Abstract: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients have substantial transfusion requirements. Factors associated with increased transfusions and the extent of blood product use in umbilical cord blood (UCB) recipients are uncertain. We reviewed blood product use in 229 consecutive adult recipients of allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota: 147 with leukemia, 82 lymphoma or myeloma; 58% received unrelated UCB and 43% sibling donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. Although neutrophil recovery was prompt (UCB median 17, range: 2-45 days, and PBSC 14, range: 3-34 days), only 135 of 229 (59% cumulative incidence) achieved red blood cell (RBC) independence and 157 (69%) achieved platelet independence by 6 months. Time to platelet independence was prolonged in UCB recipients (median UCB 41 versus PBSC 14 days) and in patients who had received a prior transplant (median 48 versus 32 days). Patients who received UCB grafts required more RBC through day 60 post-HCT (mean UCB 7.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-8.9) versus PBSC 5.2 (3.7-6.7) transfusions, P = .04), and more platelet transfusions (mean 25.2 (95% CI 22.1-28.2) versus 12.9 (9.4-16.4), P < .01) compared to PBSC recipients. Patients receiving myeloablative (MA) conditioning required more RBC and platelet transfusions during the first 2 months post-HCT compared to reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) (7.4 versus 6.2, P = .30 for RBC; 23.2 versus 17.5, P = .07 for platelets). Despite prompt neutrophil engraftment, UCB recipients had delayed platelet recovery as well as more prolonged and costly blood product requirements. Enhanced approaches to accelerate multilineage engraftment could limit the transfusion-associated morbidity and costs accompanying UCB allotransplantation.\nDocument [6]: Title: Are Blood Products Routinely Required in Pediatric Heart Surgery? Abstract: A restrictive blood transfusion strategy has emerged in adult cardiac surgery. However, the feasibility in children is poorly investigated. 352 consecutive patients undergoing open-heart surgery were retrospectively reviewed, excluding patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patient demographics, perioperative blood product usage, and clinical outcome parameters were investigated. Variables predicting the need for blood products were delineated. Of the 352 study patients, 148 patients (42%) underwent bloodless surgery and 204 (58%) were transfused. Of the 204 transfused patients, 170 (83.4%) patients received one blood transfusion and 34 (16.6%) received two or more blood transfusions. Patient's weight and preoperative hematocrit (Hct) were statistically significant in predicting the need for blood priming the CPB circuit (AUC 0.99, p < 0.001, sensitivity 96.6%, specificity 95.2%). A body weight of 8.5 kg carried a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94.5% (p < 0.001) for a blood prime. Among patients with a weight less than 8.5 kg (n = 171), only 27 patients (15.8%, p < 0.001) required additional transfusion of PRBCs. Factors impacting the need for a blood transfusion during CPB included redo surgery [odds ratio (OR) 4.61, p = 0.001] and the highest lactate level on CPB (OR 1.65, p = 0.006). Redo surgery had the highest impact (OR 7.27, p = 0.012) for requiring a postoperative PRBC transfusion. A restrictive transfusion strategy can be safely implemented in pediatric cardiac surgery. The majority of children with a BW > 8.5 kg required no blood products and those with a BW \u2264 8.5 kg required only 1 unit of blood, to prime the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit.\nDocument [7]: Title: Evaluation of effectiveness and analysis of goal-directed blood transfusion in peri-operation of major orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. Abstract: Through the establishment of blood transfusion-effectiveness assessment criteria, we aimed to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of peri-operative red blood cell transfusion for major orthopedics in elderly patients. Male and female patients (n=106) with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) stage II-III, aged 60-80 years and scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery were randomly divided into 2 groups: group I (n=52), received the traditional method of red blood cell transfusion and group II (n=54) received hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) goal-directed red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. We compared the changes in Hb, Hct, RBC, platelet (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure [P(A-a)O(2)], oxygenation index (OI) and Vigileo monitoring indicators following RBC composition transfusion before and after surgery. We also monitored wound healing time, number of hospitalization days and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer rate. Blood transfusion-effectiveness assessment criteria were used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Hb and Hct goal-directed RBC transfusion in orthopedic elderly patients. The two groups demonstrated an efficiency of 61.5 and 72.2%, respectively (P>0.05). The P(A-a)O(2) and OI in the two groups were not significantly different (P>0.05). Compared with the traditional RBC transfusion group, the Hb and Hct goal-directed RBC transfusion group presented increased RBC, Hb and Hct, as well as decreased PT and APTT and shorter wound healing time. The number of days of hospitalization and ICU transfer rate also decreased (P<0.05). The Hb and Hct goal-directed method for RBC transfusion was found to be more effective as a form of peri-operative RBC transfusion for major orthopedics in elderly patients.\nDocument [8]: Title: Effect and clinical value of coagulation test on adverse reactions of blood transfusion in patients with major bleeding in ectopic pregnancy. Abstract: Influence and clinical value of coagulation test on adverse reactions of blood transfusion in patients with major bleeding of ectopic pregnancy were analyzed. Six hundred and twenty-seven cases of ectopic pregnancy admitted to Zibo First Hospital from July 2014 to March 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The 369 patients who had adverse reactions after blood transfusion were selected as the experimental group. Another 258 patients without adverse reaction after blood transfusion were selected as the control group. Blood samples were collected 8 h before and after blood transfusion in both groups, and blood test was performed including blood count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), HB, hematocrit (HCT), as well as indicators of coagulation, including thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB). There was no significant difference between the two groups in blood routine and blood coagulation test (P>0.05). After transfusion, the RBC, WBC, PLT, HB and HCT in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). TT, PT and APTT were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05), while FIB was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.001). The coagulation in the experimental group after blood transfusion was significantly worse than that in the control group. Coagulation test can be used as a marker of adverse reactions after transfusion in patients with massive bleeding in pregnancy, providing reference and guidance for clinical diagnosis and treatment.\nDocument [9]: Title: Incidence and clinical background of posttonsillectomy bleeding related blood transfusion over 12 years. Abstract: Economies in National Health Systems forces ENT surgeons to review their indications for outpatient tonsillectomy. Therefore, it is important to preoperatively identify special risk groups who frequently have extensive posttonsillectomy bleeding with the need of a blood transfusion. Aim of this study was to estimate the incidence for posttonsillectomy bleeding related blood transfusion, to identify risk factors associated with the need for blood transfusion and to release guidelines for posttonsillectomy bleeding of high risk patients. A retrospective study was done on the medical history of 1720 patients who underwent tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis between 1982-1993 in the ENT Department at the University of Kiel. The average transfusion rate was 0.52%. End Stage Renal Disease and hypertension combined with a preoperatively decreased Hb and Hct were the risk factors identified leading to a transfusion. These patients should not get a tonsillectomy as an outpatient procedure. The Hb, Hct, PT, PTT, blood type and crossmatch should be drawn and assessed prior to tonsillectomy. We recommend immediate treatment of secondary hemorrhage in those high risk patients under general anesthesia to avoid severe complications.\nDocument [10]: Title: Application value of thromboelastography in perioperative clinical blood transfusion and its effect on the outcome of patient. Abstract: Application value of thromboelastography (TEG) in perioperative clinical blood transfusion and its effect on the outcome of patient were investigated. Seventy-four patients, admitted to The Surgical Department of the First Hospital of Zibo from March 2015 to March 2018, were selected for this study. Among them, 34 patients took only the traditional coagulation function testing method as the blood transfusion guide during the perioperative period and they were regarded as the control group. The other 40 patients used TEG as the blood transfusion guide during the perioperative period, and they were regarded as the TEG group. The coagulation function indicators in 2 h before the operation and in 24 h after the operation, the transfusion amount and blood loss during the operation, the condition of the blood transfusion during the perioperative period, the occurrence rate of the postoperative rebleeding, the length of hospital stay and mortality of the patients in the two groups were compared. The coagulation function indicators of the patients in the two groups in 2 h before the operation and in 24 h after the operation showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.050). However, APTT and Pt of the patients in the two groups both increased when compared with those before the treatment (P<0.050) and Hb, Hct, Plt and Fib all decreased (P<0.050). The suspended erythrocytes, Plt, fibrinogen and plasma in the TEG group were both significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.001). Compared with the traditional coagulation function test, TEG was more accurate for estimating the coagulation function of patient and was more suitable for estimating the condition of blood transfusion of patient in the perioperative period; also, it could shorten the recovery period of patient and it is worthwhile to promote it in the clinic.\nDocument [11]: Title: Impact of acute blood loss anemia and red blood cell transfusion on mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention. Abstract: The clinical impact of increasing levels of blood loss has been shown to increase morbidity and mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The impact of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion for severe bleeding is unknown. We systematically collected baseline and 8-h postprocedure hematocrit (HCT) values on patients undergoing PCI. The incidence of adverse events, including death and recurrent myocardial infarction, was correlated to increasing blood loss. A total of 6,799 patients undergoing PCI (January 2000 to April 2002) had serial HCT levels. Negligible, mild, moderate, and severe blood loss occurred in 43, 25, 25, and 8% of patients, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 0.3, 0.5, 1.4, and 5.7% (p < 0.0001) with increasing severity of blood loss. Blood transfusion was independently associated with mortality (relative risk [RR] 2.03, p = 0.028). A case-controlled analysis of 146 transfused patients versus 292 nontransfused patients with severe bleeding found an independent association between RBC transfusion and increased risk of 1-year mortality (RR 2.42, p = 0.0045). Patients receiving blood >35 days old had significantly worse 1-year survival rates compared with patients receiving blood <35 days old and patients not transfused (36 vs. 24 vs. 10%, p < 0.0001). In a general PCI population, increasing levels of blood loss are associated with an increased incidence of major adverse cardiac events and in-hospital mortality. RBC transfusion in the setting of severe bleeding is associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality. Transfusion of aged RBCs may also be detrimental in this setting.\nDocument [12]: Title: Effect of Retrograde Autologous Blood Priming of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Hemodynamic Parameters and Pulmonary Mechanics in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Study. Abstract: The present study aimed to assess the impact of retrograde autologous priming (RAP) on hemodynamics and pulmonary mechanics in children subjected to cardiothoracic surgery. This prospective randomized study analyzed the clinical records of 124 children with risk adjustment in congenital heart surgery-1 left to right lesions subjected to cardiac surgery. They comprised 64 patients in RAP group and 60 patients in the conventional priming group. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data of the studied patients were reported. The outcome measures included hematocrit (Hct) value, blood gases, lung mechanics parameters, transfusion needs, ICU stay, postoperative complications and mortality. Preoperatively, there were no significant differences between the studied groups regarding the demographic data, underlying lesions, laboratory data, blood gases and pulmonary mechanics parameters. Intraoperatively, RAP group patients had significantly lower amount of blood loss, less frequent need to packed red blood cells (RBC)s transfusion and better Hct values when compared with the control group. Postoperatively, RAP group patients had significantly higher Hct% at ICU arrival, significantly better pulmonary mechanics parameters and significantly shorter duration on mechanical ventilation. RAP in children older than 12 months subjected to cardiac surgery for risk adjustment in congenital heart surgery-1 left to right lesions is associated with less transfusion needs and better pulmonary mechanics.\nDocument [13]: Title: The Relevance of Fluid and Blood Management Using Microcirculatory Parameters in Children Undergoing Craniofacial Surgery. Abstract: Perioperative management of bleeding in children can be challenging. Microvascular imaging techniques have allowed evaluating the effect of blood transfusion on the microcirculation, but little is known about these effects in children. We aimed to investigate the effects of blood management using macro- and micro-hemodynamic parameters measurement in children undergoing craniofacial surgery. This is a prospective observational repeated measurement study including fourteen children. The indications for blood transfusion were changes of hemoglobin/hematocrit (Hct) levels, the presence of signs of altered tissue perfusion and impaired microcirculation images. Total and perfused vessel densities, proportion of perfused vessels, microvascular flow index, and systemic parameters (hemoglobin, Hct, lactate, mixed venous oxygen saturation, K+, heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure) were evaluated baseline (T1), at the end of the surgical bleeding (T2) and end of the operation (T3). Four patients did not need a blood transfusion. In the other 10 patients who received a blood transfusion, capillary perfusion was higher at T3 (13[9-16]) when compared with the values of at T2 (11[8-12]) (P < 0.05) but only 6 patients reached their baseline values. Although blood transfusions increased Hct values (17 \u00b1 2.4 [T2]-19 \u00b1 2.8 [T3]) (P < 0.05), there was no correlation between microvascular changes and systemic hemodynamic parameters (P > 0.05). The sublingual microcirculation could change by blood transfusion but there was not any correlation between microcirculation changes, hemodynamic, and tissue perfusion parameters even with Hct values. The indication, guidance, and timing of fluid and blood therapy may be assessed by bedside microvascular analysis in combination with standard hemodynamic and biochemical monitoring for intraoperative bleeding in children.\nDocument [14]: Title: Comparison of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels at 1, 4 and 24 h after red blood cell transfusion. Abstract: Previous studies have shown that equilibration following a red cell transfusion had occurred by 24 h. A shorter time to follow the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) after transfusion may help physicians to provide earlier and more pertinent treatment. This was a prospective study conducted from December 2014 to August 2015. This research aimed to determine the equilibration time point of the level of Hb and Hct after one unit red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Patients were randomized into three groups and Hb level and Hct were assessed at one, four or 24 h after transfusion. The mean differences in Hb level and Hct before and after transfusion were compared between each group. Sixty patients were eligible for enrollment onto this study; 20 patients were therefore allocated to each group. The median age was 51 years old, male predominating (83.33%). The most common indication for transfusion was post-operative anemia (88.33%). There were no significant differences between the baseline characteristics baseline Hb, Hct and volume of RBC transfusion in each group. The mean differences in Hb (g/dl)/Hct (%) level at the different time points of one, four and 24 h were 1.21/3.62, 1.19/3.63, and 0.95/3.09 respectively (P = 0.109 and P = 0.398, respectively). The equilibration of Hb and Hct did not differ between one, four and 24 h after a RBC transfusion. The target Hb and Hct can be determined at one hour after transfusion.\nDocument [15]: Title: Effect of Point-of-care Hemoglobin/Hematocrit Devices and Autologous Blood Salvage on Reduction of Perioperative Allogeneic Blood Transfusion. Abstract: Objective To evaluate the effect of point-of-care hemoglobin/hematocrit (POC HGB/HCT) devices and intraoperative blood salvage on the amount of perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion and blood conservation in clinical practice.Methods A total of 46 378 medical records of 22 selected hospitals were reviewed. The volume of allogeneic red blood cell and plasma, number of patients transfused, number of intraoperative autologous blood salvage, total volume of autologous blood transfusion, and amount of surgery in the year of 2011 and 2013 were tracked. Paired t-test was used in intra-group comparison, while t-test of two isolated samples carried out in inter-group comparison. P<0.05 was defined as statistically significant difference.Results In the hospitals where POC HGB/HCT device was used (n=9), the average allogeneic blood transfusion volume per 100 surgical cases in 2013 was significantly lower than that in 2011 (39.86\u00b120.20 vs. 30.49\u00b117.50 Units, t=3.522, P=0.008). In the hospitals without POC HGB/HCT meter, the index was not significantly different between 2013 and 2011. The average allogeneic blood transfusion volume was significantly reduced in 2013 than in 2011 in the hospitals where intraoperative autologous blood salvage ratio [autologous transfusion volume/(autologous transfusion volume+allogeneic transfusion volume)] was increased (n=12, t=2.290, P=0.042). No significant difference of the above index was found in the hospitals whose autologous transfusion ratio did not grow.Conclusion Intraoperative usage of POC HGB/HCT devices and increasing autologous transfusion ratio could reduce perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion.\nDocument [16]: Title: Tranexamic Acid Effectively Reduces Blood Loss and Transfusion Rates during Simultaneous Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty. Abstract: Tranexamic acid (TXA) can reduce blood loss and decrease transfusion rates after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of TXA in a homogenous, consecutive cohort of patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral primary TKA. This was a retrospective study of 50 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral simultaneous primary TKA between 2011 and 2015. Of these, 20 patients received TXA and 30 patients did not receive TXA and served as the control group. Primary outcome measurements were intraoperative estimated blood loss, hemoglobin (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct) levels on postoperative day (POD) 1 and POD2, and blood transfusion rates. Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), knee flexion/extension range of motion (ROM), and postoperative complications. There was no difference between groups for preoperative Hb and Hct (all <i>p</i>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05). The TXA group demonstrate higher Hb levels at POD1 (11.7 in TXA vs. 10.4 controls; <i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001) and POD2 (10.5 in TXA vs. 9.6 controls; <i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), as well as higher Hct levels at POD1 (35.6 in TXA vs. 32.1 controls; <i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001) and POD2 (31.9 in TXA vs. 29.3 controls; <i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). There was less percentage variation in Hb levels in the TXA group from preoperative to POD1 (17.7% in TXA vs. 25.7% controls; <i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001) and POD2 (26.1% TXA vs. 31.8% controls; <i>p</i>&#8201;=&#8201;0.019). Similarly, less percentage variation in Hct levels in the TXA group from presurgery to POD1 (17.0% TXA vs. 25.7% controls; <i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001) and POD2 (25.0% TXA vs. 31.3% controls; <i>p</i>&#8201;=&#8201;0.005). A total of 23.3% of patients in the control group required transfusions compared with no patients in the TXA (<i>p</i>&#8201;=&#8201;0.044). There were no differences in LOS, knee ROM, or number of complications. No thromboembolic events occurred. TXA in bilateral simultaneous TKA effectively reduces blood loss, maintains postoperative Hb and Hct levels, and significantly decreases blood transfusion rates. The level of evidence is level III (therapeutic study).\nDocument [17]: Title: Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients. Abstract: The transfusion trigger that physicians use to determine whether a patient requires a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is the peripheral venous hematocrit (Hct) value. Although this measurement is an indicator of the concentration of RBCs in the blood, it does not reveal the RBC volume, plasma volume, or total blood volume, nor does it give any indication of whether the patient is hypovolemic, normovolemic, or hypervolemic.\nDocument [18]: Title: Blood transfusion is associated with infection and increased resource utilization in combat casualties. Abstract: Combat casualty care has made significant advances in recent years, including administration of blood products in far-forward locations. However, recent studies have shown blood transfusion to be a significant risk factor for infection and increased resource utilization in critically injured patients. We therefore sought to investigate the incidence of blood transfusion and its association with infection and resource utilization in combat casualties. Prospective data were collected and retrospectively reviewed on 210 critically injured patients admitted to the USNS Comfort over a 7-week period during the 2003 assault phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Patients were stratified by age, gender, and injury severity score (ISS). Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess blood transfusion and hematocrit (HCT) as independent risk factors for infection and intensive care unit (ICU) admission controlling for age, gender, and ISS. The study cohort had a mean age of 30 +/- 2 years, a mean ISS of 14 +/- 3, 84 per cent were male, and 88 per cent sustained penetrating trauma. Blood transfusion was required in 44 per cent (n = 93) of the study cohort. Transfused patients had a higher ISS (18 +/- 4 vs. 10 +/- 3, P < 0.01), a higher pulse rate (105 +/- 4 vs. 93 +/- 3, P < 0.0001), and a lower admission HCT (27 +/- 1 vs. 33 +/- 2, P < 0.0001) compared with patients not transfused. Patients receiving blood transfusion had an increased infection rate (69% vs. 18%, P < 0.0001), ICU admission rate (52% vs. 21%, P < 0.0001), and ICU length of stay (6.7 +/- 2.1 days vs. 1.4 +/- 0.5 days, P < 0.0001) compared with nontransfused patients. However, there was no significant difference in mortality between transfused and nontransfused patients. Multivariate binomial regression analysis identified blood transfusion and HCT as independent risk factors for infection (P < 0.01) and blood transfusion as an independent risk factor for ICU admission (P < 0.05). Combat casualties have a high incidence of blood transfusion. Blood transfusion is an independent risk factor for infection and increased resource utilization. Therefore, consideration should be given to the use of alternative blood substitutes and recombinant human erythropoietin in the treatment and management of combat casualties.\nDocument [19]: Title: A Mechanistic Analysis of Possible Blood Transfusion Failure to Increase Circulatory Oxygen Delivery in Anemic Patients. Abstract: The effects of changing hematocrit (Hct) on the rate of circulatory oxygen ([Formula: see text]) delivery were modeled analytically to describe transfusion of 0.5-3.0 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC, 300 mL/unit, 60% Hct) to anemic patients. In our model, Hct affects [Formula: see text] delivery to the microcirculation by changing blood [Formula: see text] carrying capacity and blood viscosity, which in turn affects blood flow velocity and, therefore, [Formula: see text] delivery. Changing blood velocity impacts the [Formula: see text] delivery by affecting the oxygen diffusive losses as blood transits through the arteriolar vasculature. An increase in Hct has two opposite effects: it increases the blood [Formula: see text] carrying capacity and decreases the flow velocity. This suggests the existence of an optimal Hct that maximizes [Formula: see text] delivery. Our results show that maximal [Formula: see text] delivery occurs in the anemic range, where [Formula: see text]%. Optimal blood management is associated with transfusing enough units up to reaching maximal [Formula: see text] delivery. Although somewhat complex to implement, this practice would result in both substantial blood savings and improved [Formula: see text] delivery.\nDocument [20]: Title: Single dose Intravenous Tranexamic acid may not be adequate to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion requirement in patients undergoing single stage bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Abstract: Simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) causes increased blood loss and increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is commonly used to minimize blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, the optimal regimen of TXA in single stage bilateral TKA is still not defined. In this retrospective study, 35 patients who received TXA and 31 patients who did not receive TXA were evaluated for blood loss and transfusion requirement. Both the groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, body mass index and preoperative haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (Hct). There was no significant difference in the change in Hb levels (2.42 \u00b1 1.28 vs 2.44 \u00b1 1.31 ; p=0.95) and Hct (1.37 \u00b1 0.96 vs 1.62 \u00b1 0.98, p=0.22) between the groups. There were no significant differences between the study and control groups in the intraoperative blood loss (163.71 vs 165.32 ml, p=0.92), drain output (621.71 vs 695.65 ml, p=0.65) and total blood loss (785.0 vs 860.97, p=0.40). There was no significant difference in allogeneic blood transfusion between the groups (62.85% received blood in the study group vs 58.06% in the control group, p>0.05). Single intraoperative dose of TXA may not be adequate to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion requirement in bilateral TKA.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n\nResponse:\n",
